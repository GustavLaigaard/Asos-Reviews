"May 15, 2018",5,Happily surprised! LOVE ASOS.,"I see a lot of negative reviews, however i would like to share my positive experience. I ordered at the weekend and expected Wednesday - Items received a day early on Tuesday! I was notified all the time of updates on my order. The clothes I ordered were from ASOS brand instead of the others they sell. I normally shop on places such as missguided and boohoo but because of the price I don't expect much quality wise, so when i ordered Asos's own brand i thought it would be the same with some items having to go back but worth trying on because of the cheap price. However each item I received was such good quality and made form nice thick material they look like they were more expensive. The sizes were also consistent! I am so pleased and have completely been converted to an ASOS customer for my future purchases. I would recommend this company. (L) Thank you Asos for my quick and beautiful clothes - ready for my upcoming holiday! :D"
"May 15, 2018",1,They missed the estimated delivery date…,"They missed the estimated delivery date by one week. Order was supposed to be decor for a surprise bachelorette party. very frustrated with customer service, no explanation to the delay or any sort of help or compensation given.They falsely advertise their delivery dates and in doing so, are messing peoples plans. I won't be ordering form them again, for sure"
"May 15, 2018",1,AVOID ASOS AT ALL COSTS,"A month ago I placed an order for a few black summer dresses and paid for express shipping because I needed black clothes urgent. I have just lost a loved one, and where I come from we wear all black for at least a couple of months - I am not a very big fan of all black so I really needed some new clothes to get me by these couple of months. Unfortunately, four weeks on, my order never arrived despite my efforts to raise a flag almost as soon as I placed the order, as I knew that not receiving a tracking link within a few hours was bad news. Anyhow, customer care has apologized and advised me to place a replacement order, which I did. A week later I still haven't received a tracking link or my order. I have tried email but no one is replying. I have tried explaining that I really need black outfits and since apparently they cannot do the simple task of shipping an order, then they should at least give me back my money without further delay so I can go shop for black clothes. Nothing. They don't even care. It has now been a month and they still have my money (more than 200 pounds) and I still don't have any black clothes or money to go shop for some. I have tried being polite, even apologized after writing an angry email. I have tried reasoning with them. I have tried making them understand my situation hoping that they will be more sensitive. Nothing. Still no replies. Still no clothes. Still no refund. Asos online shop is incapable of letting people shop online. It's Russian roulette whether your order will be dispatched and it's a nightmare to get your hard earned money back. I have relied on them and they have let me down twice with no intention of fixing their mistake. Please avoid them. Do not make the same mistake as I did trusting them twice."
"May 15, 2018",4,great website but the app sometimes…,"great website but the app sometimes isn't that user friendly, sometimes quality of clothes is questionable but vast choice and speedy delivery"
"May 15, 2018",4,Great website,"Been reading all those one star reviews and I am surprised by all those bad experiences. Personally I haven't returned anything since I am buying from outside of Europe and return shipping would cost me equal or more than the value of the items I purchased. So if something doesn't fit, I just give it to friends or sell it.They do carry a lot of brands which is always great, and have sales most of the time. Usually orders takes 2-3 days to process and shipping is quite fast so no complain on that.The packing isn't the best (carboard box with some airfilled plastic bags to prevent items from moving around), for clothes or shoes its fine but for items that are more fragile like makeup, they do sometimes come slightly damaged.I love the fact that on the website, they do have short video clips of models wearing the items which gives a better idea of how it fits.Overall I still like them and would still recommend."
"May 14, 2018",1,Horrible order processing,"Horrible order processing. I purchased 2 dresses for my graduation ceremony. The first time they delivered me a faulty item, with a noticeable stain at the front side, right at the chest area. I requested for a replacement and they sent me a wrong dress. I contacted the customer service for a second replacement, and was told a new replacement would be delivered to me before my graduation ceremony started. They promised me I would have enough time to receive the dress and try it on. But that dress never arrived. Until I contacted the customer service again, they told me they canceled the order and refunded me my money. They made multiple mistakes when taking the process of my order and made a promise that would never be met. Last contact with the customer service, encountered bad attitude. Wouldn't buy from them ever again."
"May 14, 2018",1,Horrible company with a terrible return policy,Horrible company with a terrible return policy. I returned 2 items from an order recently because they didn't fit. Since I used a promo code they told me a would not be able to receive a refund or exchange. I basically just gave them back 2 shirts for FREE. Will not be shopping at asos again and do not recommend others do either unless you are 100% sure you will LOVE the product.
"May 14, 2018",1,Only order if you're keeping your item,Only order if you're keeping your item. Returns is a complete nightmare.
"May 14, 2018",1,NEVER order anything from here!,This has been my worst experience with an online shopping site ever! The site used to be good back in the day but now it's terrible. I have been waiting for over 2 month to get 250 euros back from them. Every single time I contact them they say that they can't give me a time estimate when I will finally receive my money. Please just please don't buy ANYTHING from this site!
"May 13, 2018",1,Only order if you know you'll keep your…,Only order if you know you'll keep your order. Items returned by collect plus (2nd may) . It does say up to 7 working day and they sure held up to that. Despite tracking saying they had my order (00:45 8th may) they denied this. Responses were robotic. It was at close of business on the 7th day (11th may)  I got an email saying they had my order back but then have to wait another 5-10 working days for the money to be back in my account. This is outwith their control apparently. Holding onto my money so they can gain interest on it.
"May 13, 2018",2,Fine until something goes wrong,"ASOS are fine as long as their service doesn’t go wrong. Then they are completely useless. Contacted live chat after Hermes claimed to have tried to deliver a package when they hadn’t been anywhere near my house at the time. Only found out through the online tracker - unsurprisingly no card had been put through the door as they had never been at the door. Got a “we use companies that mirror our standards” response, which says it all. Companies that have no idea what good customer service looks like. Having paid for premier delivery service, there’s little premier about it when they use the likes of Hermes for their deliveries. Will write off the cost of the premier service and go back to using more reliable and customer-focussed online retailers in future."
"May 13, 2018",1,Delays and lies,They delayed my order that I was supposed to receive a week ago and I have to wait for additional two weeks. When I emailed their Customer Service they gave me standardized robotic answers..  AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE
"May 12, 2018",1,One annoyed customer,"I am disgusted with asos and their incompetent courier DPD. Having placed an order and paying for next day delivery, as normal, I received updates via email regarding the status of my order. This morning I was able to book a delivery window between 11am and 12midday. 11am came and went.. by 1:30pm still nothing. I have gone back and forth with asos and DPD to be told delivery was attempted at 11:12am. This is a absolute lie! The driver never came! Demi at asos was sooooo unhelpful and I am disgusted by the service I received. I am still waiting for this parcel and as the driver is not in the area, I have been told that he may “reattempt” this delivery that never took place in the first place!!! I order from asos regularly but this has changed everything. I am fuming. Moral of the story: Lying drivers and unhelpful customer service agents."
"May 12, 2018",1,Disgraceful customer service,"Disgraceful customer service. Ordered a parcel for next day delivery. DPD lost parcel which I had to find out myself. In contact with Asos multiple times I had to keep chasing them for answers. 16 DAYS after my parcel was due only then did they send out a new one. No refund or voucher to compensate, despite me being a regular and loyal customer, won’t be using them again."
"May 12, 2018",1,One of the worst experiences ever,"One of the worst experiences ever! More than a year ago i bought an abercrombie sweatshirt witch was fault but i didnt send that back because i was happy for getting it since i could not buy it from the online store, now i gave them a second chance on a pair of shoes and before my order i asked them too if the peoduct was as in the pictures but what i got was different and now i ll may lose the bank fee plus the conversion if i ll return them back to them and they dont answear on my emails neither they want to compensate me!just thing about it before you buy anything!"
"May 11, 2018",5,Actually I considered it pretty…,"Actually I considered it pretty risky ordering from Asos after reading all this negative comments. But I liked two dresses so much I decided to take this risk. Well, it was definitely worth it! The order came one day before the estimated time. One of the dresses was the perfect fit so I decided to keep it, the second one I returned. The return is for free, with very clear instructions. The money is back on my account (again, faster than the estimated time). Definitely recommend ordering from Asos."
"May 11, 2018",1,Appalling customer service,"Appalling customer service. No complaints procedure, discount code didn't work and they wouldn't honour it when I got in touch, customer service chat was like a robot spouting policies without being in the least bit human. Only option is to send everything back for a refund and then reorder. First and last attempt using ASOS, wish I'd read the reviews here first."
"May 11, 2018",5,Always perfect,"Always perfect! Good prices, fast delivery - Easy to shop at Asos when living in Sweden. Never needed customer service because they just delivery as I want them to!"
"May 10, 2018",1,Item delivered like it had been crushed!!!,"I ordered a pair of Adidas sliders from ASOS and not only did they not come next day delivery (as was paid for) but the parcel turned up with a torn open bag and the box looked like it had been ran over by a truck! When I contacted ASOS to express my displeasure with the state of the way the item was delivered, I basically got told 'it's not our responsibility', yet as the vendor I think it is 100% your responsibility to ensure that your items turn up in a state that a consumer would expect. I don't purchase items with any ounce of expectation that they would be delivered in such a state. I will certainly be looking to shop elsewhere from now on due to this experience!"
"May 10, 2018",1,POOR CUSTOMER & DELIVERY SERVICES,"After only 3 orders, I have had to stop ordering from Asos - they chose a different courier the last time I made an order, called Hermes, which could not find my address (?????????) and so did not deliver the order. Hermes does not have a contact number - there is a telephone no. with 3 options, all of them ending with ""you can find the answer online"", no matter which one you choose. Asos, on the other hand, does not even have a telephone number. Rubbish and disappointing experience - I SUGGEST THAT YOU STAY AWAY FROM ASOS, UNLESS YOU HAVE TIME TO WASTE and FIND A SERIOUS ONLINE COMPANY"
"May 10, 2018",1,Please DO NOT USE this company,Please DO NOT USE this company. VERY FRAUDULENT!!! Package was suppose to be here in 2 days & UPS says there is no package. But I have a tracking number.  What's up with that but lying & cheating!!!!
"May 10, 2018",5,Perfect!,"Dress came in on time, packaged beautifully. Dress was perfect. Thank you so much ASOS!"
"May 10, 2018",5,Brilliant costumer service,Brilliant costumer service. I have been shopping with them for years.
"May 10, 2018",4,Great customer service,"Great customer service, efficient delivery and clear communications. However it takes a while for returns to be processed, around a week. Zara is quicker."
"May 09, 2018",1,"Shockingly bad ""Customer Service""","My order was for mixed items and one of the sandals that I ordered, had a different shoe inside the packaging, than what I had ordered. I've known Asos auto response ""customer service"" to be quite bad previously but figured that surely, if they mess up on their part, it must be a different story.... WRONG. After a 10 minute chat with ""Ruben"", which included all but copy paste responses, not a single question about what I received nor a single apology for their mistake, I was just told to use their normal return service. bog standard, done. I'm so underwhelmed by their flipping ridiculous 10 wpm ""Customer Service"" right now, I can't even comprehend what just happened. SHOCKING!"
"May 09, 2018",1,ASOS CUSTOMER APATHY,"This has to be the most terrible company for customer service. I have had nothing but a horrible experience. I am so upset I don't even know where to begin. They sent me a faulty product, they have absolute rude f********  customer service representatives, they lie about refunds, and they make it their mission to inconvenience you. Please take your experiences to Twitter/FB/IG with the hashtag #AsosCustomerApathy because they don't care and from my experience and observation, they treat their customers with very little regard. My purchase can't be located ironically after I make a complaint and now im being kept from contacting customer care to resolve it. I have had ENOUGH!"
"May 09, 2018",5,I have ordered some clothes for the…,"I have ordered some clothes for the very first time on the 6th of May, and I have already received them on the 9th (today) even though there was a long weekend followed by a bank holiday. I don't often write reviews, but I was really surprised by the quickness and quality of the items I have received from ASOS so here I am. All my clothes fit perfectly well after following the size guide on the website which I was the most pleased about, as well as, even though the shirts I've bought weren't expensive at all, their quality and material seem great! Overall, I am very delighted I have found this online clothing store and I will definitely buy most of my clothes from here in the future."
"May 09, 2018",2,Shipping was extremely slow,"Shipping was extremely slow, and goods just didnt fit well at all"
"May 09, 2018",1,Ordered a pair of CK jeans,"Ordered a pair of CK jeans, I already have some at home in the same size but these ones were sized up wrong as they were a lot smaller than stated. When I received the jeans I was disgusting by the way they came, the bag was already open on the inside and the jeans were screwed up. Someone else had obviously returned them before me and ASOS didn’t bother folding them back up! The customer services were rude and useless not even an apology. I had ordered sunglasses on a separate occasion and they were scratched when I received them. The way they do returns is beyond a disaster! Have to wait 7 working days for them to recieve item and then another 5 working days to get the money back! But last time it took them almost 14 working days."
"May 08, 2018",5,No problems at all,From Denmark. I have ordered several times and the items have fully lived up to my expectations. I had to return a pair of shoes (I have learned that “wide fit” is really wide) and have just received an email that they have returned the money to my account. I think that the “people of your weight and height normally buy this size” feature is pure genius since I would have gotten a size bigger otherwise (and that would have been to big). So all in all just a positive experience :-)
"May 08, 2018",3,bought a chain.,"Nice chain, came next day.. bit bigger than i thought it would be,, not crafted brilliant"
"May 08, 2018",3,How to get rid of low blood pressure-- order from ASOS,"Update: My package just up and disappeared I guess because I've yet to see it. On the bright side, ASOS customer service refunded my order after they realized they could not send me a new packaged since the items I ordered were all out of stock. I guess while my experience wasn't great, I'm willing to try ordering again and hoping for no delivery mishaps next time around...!My only regret is that I cannot upload documents and videos on Trust Pilot to offer more credibility for my very negative review. UPS said that my package was delivered 6 days ago. At my university, all the on-campus students' mail go to the mail room, where we go to pick it up. I thought it was strange that I didn't receive an email notifying that my package had arrived. I went to the mailroom and long story short, nothing ever came for me. Nothing under my name, the tracking number, or address. I emailed ASOS customer service telling them that I never received my order. They just sent me a copy-paste message. Okay, understandable-- they listed some valid reasons I might not have gotten my package. Except I had already gone through their list because it's the exact same as the one in their FAQs page. I don't have neighbors (at least not in the traditional sense) and it's impossible for them to pick up my package without my student ID. Not to mention, the mailroom never received a package for me anyway. There is ONE drop-off point for the package as well, no backyards or fences of the sort.I contacted UPS. They threw their hands up in the air and claimed the package was delivered. I don't know how they knew it was delivered when all they did was pass it on to USPS according to the ""track my order"" option on ASOS. Oh, maybe USPS made a mistake on the delivery?I walked into my uni's USPS. They said nope and said to try the main one. I called and guess what? MY TRACKING NUMBER DOESN'T EXIST. The employee was confused because she said they never received such a package to deliver. No USPS could actually, because the number wasn't trackable for them.So my package is in the bermuda triangle I guess. UPS and ASOS says it was delivered. I look at my package-less self and say it most definitely was not. ASOS customer service after rounds of infuriating emails got back and said they'd resend my order. Everything worked ou-- NO. The items I ordered are SOLD OUT. At this point, I just want my darn refund and to cast away the company forever.I can't comment on the quality of the material from ASOS. The ease of shopping was good. But this is the most contrived, ridiculous customer experience of my life and I am most ready to never repeat it again. If you're considering ordering from ASOS, think about why there is a sudden barrage of 1 star reviews and ask yourself if it's worth the risk. Clearly there's bias involved since the most furious customers are the ones giving the most feedback, but at the end of the day, there are clearly some big delivery/customer service issues going on."
"May 07, 2018",3,I don't believe in a brand itself…,I don't believe in a brand itself because asos shoes are low quality. But other brands which you can buy through this store is good.
"May 06, 2018",1,"Extremely late delivery, disrespectful customer service.","I made two orders on Asos on the 30th April that were meant to arrive the day before yesterday at the latest (Friday 4th May). When I contacted Customer service they told me it could take up until Wednesday the 16th May for them to arrive for reasons that were ""outside their control."" I told them I needed the items for a holiday and that I didn't understand why it would take so long when Asos had said at checkout that it would arrive on the 4th at the very latest . They told me they would only be able to take ""further steps"" after Wednesday the 16th and so that I should contact them at this date if I still had not received anything. I just found the customer service very poor. The first person I spoke to, ""Denise"" even ended the conversation mid-chat after having disregarded all my comments and telling me that I was ""more than welcome"" to return the items if I wasn't happy they had not arrived on time... I thought that was quite rude. It surprised me a lot.  Quite upset about not only the late delivery but also the poor customer service. Asos do not seem very concerned about their customers and expect them to just deal with their delivery problems passively. Asos, It is a little bit unprofessional to tell the customer that the reasons for the late delivery are ""out of your control."" Maybe you should take responsibility, instead of blaming a more-than-two week delay on your carrier?  I contacted customer service for a solution and an answer to why I had not got what I had paid for, but instead I received some sassy comments from your customer service. Kind of uncalled for..."
"May 06, 2018",4,"Lacking a decent returns process, alas everything else us fab!","4/5 stars I would give Asos. They lose a point due to poor returns process.On the plus side, Asos is absolutely excellent for finding any attire according to ones needs. From pink ball gown dresses, to rock chick kilt skirts, your sure to find something suitable and probably within budget.I will definitely be visiting and purchasing again!"
"May 05, 2018",1,Ridiculous says you can get 10perdect…,Ridiculous says you can get 10perdect discount on your order it's the worst thing to get it sorted.... I tried to get the email 10 times with the code when finally couldn't have any patients absolute disgrace saying you get it off but when you on checkout they don't give you the code.
"May 05, 2018",1,Worst service ever,"Worst service ever! Was on holiday with my wife and looking forward our trip! So I ordered matching t-shirts to wear with my wife. The delivery was never received on time and when I complained all they could say wait till 10pm, so I waited till 10pm and ask them again. Now they are saying wait till next week till receive my item. Also only compensation they could offer me was 10% discount only last one month! I could get that discount from my friends student discount. So disappointed in there service. ( ordered item on Wednesday and they only sent the item on Saturday to be delivered.) Never using this company ever again. Thank you for ruining my holiday."

"May 05, 2018",2,Don’t order from this company,Don’t order from this company! They don’t care about keeping you as a customer. Bad service. I’m left out of pocket and have been ripped off by them.
"May 05, 2018",5,The best web site ever,"The best web site ever, great selections , best quality,"
"May 04, 2018",1,THIS IS THE WORST,THIS IS THE WORST WEBSHITE I'VE EVER SHIPPED FROM! THEY CHEAT ON ME. I DID'NT GET THE ITEMS I'VE ORDERED AND THEY TOOK THE MONEY FROM ME. DON'T USE ASOS IT'S TERRIBLE
"May 04, 2018",1,Have been an avid customer since its…,"Have been an avid customer since its start-up and in the recent years Asos has grown immensely, unfortunately their customer service has not.Still no direct contact number to call, a live chat that is now available but you'll only be at the receiving end of generic and computerised responses, twitter has a delayed response too-and they seem to have backlog of customer  tweets to reply to rather than instance responses. Not good enough in this day and age with all the technological advancement!Further, when you purchase the last item (and then its gone out of stock) they end up sending you the incorrect item rather than notifying you its out of stock (guess to save them the hassle?) which then means you're left with the burden to returning an item you didn't place and don't care for? this has happened to me at least 4 times on occasions-and its definitely not a coincidence.On the live chat I requested that somebody from customer service call me so I can discuss regarding the mistakes made in my previous orders, they said somebody would call me within 24 hours. 4 weeks later, and yet still no call?Not good enough Asos-and you know it!"
"May 04, 2018",5,The best company,"I don't know how I did live before i came across this company a few years ago. I absolutely love it! I have been buying from them every month, sometimes  every week, as i am a terrible shopaholic and fashionista The items  usually delivered in 2-3 days, hermes couriers send me their updates all of the time. If I don't like something I return it free of charge and the shop is just next door to my house, so it takes me only a couple of minutes to return. Refunds are made in one week to ten days and I have never ever had a single issue with that. I even don't pay with my card until I receive my item and I am entirely happy with it, as I use Klarna payment (such a great option!). I am not a big fun of ASOS brand itself ( I did try and did order it before and there  was always something not to my liking - would not fit properly, did not like the material, ect), but they sell my favourite brands and all my Moschino, Versace, Ralph Lauren were purchased via ASOS website. Their app is great and very convenient, as it allows to tick my favourite items, keep an eye on them when the price goes down, it did allow me to get some fantastic bargains. I also collect points which then turn into vouchers and I can spend them to buy more stuff. I was very surprised to see all these negative reviews in here.. I guess we all have different experience. But i think I have placed more then 100 orders with them and nothing ever went wrong. If there was a small issue, it always have been resolved to the best for me. So I highly recommend this company, as I trust it 200% and i promise you nobody paid me for this feedback, lol. Thank you, ASOS!x"
"May 04, 2018",1,Extremely unhappy with this brand,Extremely unhappy with this brand! Orders either do not arrive at the needed date or if they do the sizing is wrong. Asked for size replacement and got a refund ?! It is more than a nonsense that has been shot and packaged nicely.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!
"May 03, 2018",1,Asos is a total waste of time,Asos is a total waste of time. They have been lying to me about my refund & giving me different stories including that they can’t locate my return in their warehouse therefore not able to process my refund 👀😢😢😢 what a joke
"May 03, 2018",1,Scammers! BEWARE!,"It will be a short review - i ordered Armani watches, T-shirt and shower gel. Surprisingly,  i've got only T-shirt and shower gel, contacted support - BANNED ACCOUNT EVEN IF I HAVE A VIDEO PROOF OF UNPACKAGE! BEWARE OF SCAMMERS, DON'T MAKE MY MISTAKE!"
"May 03, 2018",1,Discriminatory Pricing,"Shopped with ASOS for years - have been sent damaged items on countless occasions, along with the wrong size, the wrong item or have had items missing. Customer services is beyond a joke, and you’ll get a completely different answer by phoning than you will by emailing, though no one ever has a solution, or apologises for issues with an order. Wasted a lot of money calling them only to be told there was nothing they could do. Besides the fact they are unreliable and rude, I have also discovered that they charge more for the petite range because ‘they are manufactured differently’. The only advice they could give is to order from the normal range, which, if you wear a UK 2 isn’t an option. Disgusted by the discriminatory prices but they get away with it because so few places stock small sizes."
"May 02, 2018",3,Explain me:,"Explain me:CAN SOMEBODY TELL ME THE RELEVANCE OF THE REVIEWS?

"May 02, 2018",5,Love ASOS,"ASOS is my life saver for special occasions. When I can't find anything in my local stores, I always choose ASOS. It have never failed me, I'm not scared to order more than one thing because I know that they will refund me. Shipping is always on time. Never had even a single problem with it."
"May 02, 2018",5,Didn't check Trust Pilot first... glad!!,"I ordered from Asos without checking Trust Pilot first, which was completely out of character for me recently as I've been looking for bridesmaids dresses for my wedding in August!!So after I ordered I realised what I'd done and came straight here to read reviews.. my heart dropped :( the reviews don't seem too great on the most part; delayed or missing orders, rude customer service, wrong items or size - it goes on! However, panic aside, I thought there was nothing I could do but wait - and hope! I have been so impressed! My order came within 3 days, all the updates from Hermes kept me in the loop and I just love the dresses!! One of my BM is calling tonight to try hers on, the other one will get to try hers at the weekend.So up to now everything's been great, and the dresses went into the sale from £85 to £34, with a further 10% off at checkout, which was a fantastic bit of luck for me and my fiance. I just need to keep my fingers crossed that they fit now for a perfect result ☺☺"
"May 02, 2018",1,DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY,"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY IF YOU REQUIRE YOUR ORDER TO ARRIVE WHEN THEY SAY IT WILL. I ordered my brother some holiday clothes for his birthday present. The delivery date was to be the 26th April. My brother was due to fly on the evening of the 27th. I ordered 3 t shirts and 2 pair of shorts for him and ASOS said they would arrive on or before the 26th April. Their parcel deliver arm HERMES text ot say delivery on the 26th at 12-4pm. Then another message to say 1pm-5pm. Then no message at all to there would be no delivery! I had arranged to see my brother that night. to give him his holiday clothes. I contacted ASOS on the 27th who apologised and said delivery would be that day and the item was yet to be dispatched to Hermes (despite their online tracking which said it had been dispatched to the courrier on the 26th). Same situation on the 27th. 12-4pm delivery. Then 1-5pm delivery. Nothing arrived at 5pm so my brother said he would just have to buy more clothes when he got to his holiday. Delivery was then on the 30th at 3pm. I asked ASOS for a discount of compensation for wasting my time by waiting in for delivery. They refused and said on occasion they had problems delivering items.

"May 02, 2018",1,Very poor customer service,"Very poor customer service. I rang the online help number to which I found very unhelpful, I then noticed I had been charged 28 pound for the call, I am a student on part time wages and this is a disgrace. Why does such a big company need to charge this for customer service calls?"
"May 02, 2018",1,very poor promotions/refund processing and customer care service,"Hello,Asos has very poor customer service. I work myself in a customer service setting and it is clear that this company does not go the extra mile for their customers and hide behind their procedures.I placed two orders and used the 50 euros discount of 200 euros promotion at the end of March.I send for both orders a few items back ending up below the 200 euros. When I ordered I read the small print and I was under the impression, that if you refund things and you dip under the used promo offer but still fall in the next available promo offer, the discount would be adjusted appropriately.In the email I received in which the refund was processed it states the following:**	If a discount was applied to your original order, the amount refunded will be adjusted to allow for the revised order value and appropriate discount level.	This is very misleading. ""adjusted to allow for the revised order value and appropriate discount level."" To me this means the discount level will be revised to the lower available discount and not fully removed. Needless to say, I was disappointed that I lost the 50 euros discount fully.But then I realized that with one of the 2 orders, I would loose the 50 euros discount and that the 37 euros dress I send back, would have a zero refund. Due to this misleading promo/promo wording.Logically I asked for the dress to be send back to me, since I send it back for nothing, something I obviously would not have done, was it more clear that I would not get ""adjusted to allow for the revised order value and appropriate discount level."" and was told this is not possible and I was given a standardized answer.Nothing stands in the way, to send out this dress again. Especially since when I signed up, I paid for a full year free shipping as well.When I asked for a supervisor or manager, I was told to contact the general email address/visit the general help section on the website.I only signed up recently and spend like 330 euros on a few orders, but needless to say, with this level of customer service and with the way they run their promotions, I will take my business elsewhere.Please be very careful when using the promotions and better ask customer service before you refund anything how much you will get actually refunded."
"May 02, 2018",1,words cannot discribe the awful…,words cannot discribe the awful customer service this company provides.i signed up to their premier delivery service as im going away so was after some new clothes. after ordering two items i was expecting them to arrive the following day to no avail!!i find it poor that an asos customer service worker said to me 'that they choose carriers that believe can mirror their high standards for a level of service'. the two items ordered are arriving from two different delivery companies - Hermes and DPD. i've dealt with both companies before Hermes for Zalando and DPD for Nike and have never had an issue with either company in fact i normally get a txt message from hermes or a call and DPD alllow me to choose what time i would like the delivery.blaming the delivery company is a poor excuse and i will let others know to expect the same poor customer service when inquiring about your parcel and believe me you will be speaking to them soon after
"May 01, 2018",1,I am extremely unsatisfied with my most…,"I am extremely unsatisfied with my most recent ASOS experience. They sent TWO articles of clothing that were mislabled (one was an 18 mislabled as a 14 when I ordered a 10...) and it took over 30 days for my package to arrive - their return/exchange policy is 28 days...so when I tried to get a refund, they said no because I had the product past their return/exchange policy which is RIDICULOUS. If I could give them 0 stars, I would. I am never shopping with ASOS again."
"May 01, 2018",5,Love it!,"Love it! Nice products for good prices. They deliver in plastig bags, so no big boxes for just 2 pieces for example. And there return policy is fantastic: in the same bag, with an attached sticker with the retour adress, great!"

They lied and said they came here at 5:05 when I had a delivery from Amazon at that time then when I spoke to their head office they turned around and told me they only deal with business I went to speak to customer services customer services said they don’t know who the carrier is so how are you making people pay for next day delivery and you’re not 100% certain that it’s been delivered I thought is a fortune and company do not use them they’re not 100% certain and customer service is awful

But I have to say I am truly disappointed in how they treated me in regards to the delivery...well non delivery. Made an order last Monday (have the premier service) no one was in to collect the parcel on the Tuesday, so changed it to the Saturday. I then received an email/text on Thursday saying that I had requested to be delivered to Northampton ( I live in Essex) Why would I request my parcel to be delivered 2 hours away from where I live. After going back and forth with ASOS, the last reply to which I had got to the point where I just don't have any faith in ASOS anymore, was when they suggested I take the 2 hour journey to retrieve the parcel. So I have to pay out £30+ of petrol to collect my parcel which was sent somewhere else by DPD and ASOS could not resolve this with DPD. Utterly disgusted with the customer service, they did nothing to help me and they were telling me they had sorted the issue which was also a lie. On top of that I had to keep explaining myself to a different representative of the Customer Care team each time I received a partly scripted reply. Ultimately I told them to tell DPD to return the parcel, which is the second time I've had to do this."

I received the shoe and was forced to pay $30 in duty, of which I was not ever told I would have to pay. only to find out the new pair was ALSO the wrong size.Save your time, go to a store and buy your clothes/shoes...Asos is clearly incapable of running a legitimate business with functioning warehousing, shipping or customer service departments.  I will never buy from it again, and would never recommend it to anyone."
"April 29, 2018",1,Terrible service,"Terrible service. I specifically ordered from the US website to ensure that I wouldn’t get hit with a customs fee due to the items coming from the UK. Lo and behold I get hit with a whopping $68CAD customs fee. I contact them to find out why this happened they said that despite the fact that I ordered from the American site sometimes items ship from the warehouse in the UK and somehow that’s my fault. Not to mention the quality of the items, I bought a pair of pants and within days there’s stitching coming out and holes everywhere. Will not be giving this company any more business. Speak with your wallets."

But it was a mistake... Like other reviewers stated, my order never came to me, and ended up getting a refund. Lol. I tried to contact customer service and I was told that they were having shipping issues, so fine no worries it happens. But 2 weeks later nothing came, nada. I'm done with this kind of business, or if that's what they want to call it. I have friends and family members that orders here. Guess what? Y'all just lost 'em too."

"April 26, 2018",5,WORTH IT!!,"I was very worried to order from ASOS because of all the reviews BUT I don't regret! I loved my dress!!! quality is really good an exactly like the picture. Now, a few things to take into consideration:1. If you need it for a special occasion, order fast shipping. I had it shipped to Vancouver, BC and it was here 4 days after I purchase it. Most of the bad reviews are based on not having items delivered on time so to be safe just pay for express shipping, it's only $15 CAD.2. DUTY EXPENSES. They charged me $22 for duty taxes which is not that bad compared to other things I have ordered before. I don't know if it depends on the total $ of your order but mine was around $75 with express shipping."
"April 26, 2018",1,I wish I could give them zero stars,"I wish I could give them zero stars. They offer international delivery, but refuse to be responsible for it.They give no tracking info. Well over a month past the delivery date and every time I get in touch with customer service they ask me to verify my address (4 times now) and tell me to check my doorstep and ask my neighbors.In my country you have to sign for packages and present an ID, so they're really not interested in customer service. Just trying to waste time and make you give up."
"April 25, 2018",1,The worst customer service ever! Agent Sofia is the worst customer support agent!,"The worst customer service ever!I've faced extremely rude customer service on ASOS!They notified me that one of the items (pants) in my order is apparently out of stock and they refunded me. But the thing is that I've ordered a combination of a blazer and pants and I don't need a blazer without pants!! However, they decided to proceed with my order even if mandatory part of it is missing. And then they just sent me a notification how sorry they are! No discount, nothing! We I've tried to cancel my order via so called live chat I've faced very rude attitude fro the support agent Sofia (chat number:‎13015863). She was so unprofessional and rude that I decided to take some time to register here and leave a feedback. I've never faceв an attitude like this anywhere! I asked why ASOS haven't informed me about the change. I mean who needs only the half of the suit? Her response was: We deliver a lot of orders around the world, we don't have time to inform every customer! Who ever says this to anyone?????? And what am I if not a client then? She should have given me some robot-like answers because even this would be better! She also said that they have very few employees to do stuff like this! She has not given me any direct answers and was acting like she wants me to back off. When I said that she is incompetent and asked for a senior manager she told me to be polite and calm down!!! Literally!!! This is absolutely unacceptable! ASOS, if you reading this, you better fire her..."
"April 25, 2018",1,Worst customer service EVER,Worst customer service I have ever experienced with any company before.

You guessed it, i ordered the wrong size but the returns policy is very straight forward.Slip enclosed for the return, notified when ASOS had received my parcel back and then notified again when my exchange was being re-shipped.Excellent service and highly recommend."
"April 23, 2018",4,Asos is good place to shop,Delivery was pretty quick chlothes we're true to there size only thing I can say is that they need to make sure it looks more presentable when in delivery packaging

Bad service. Bad quality clothes."
"April 21, 2018",1,Shocking customer service at ASOS,"Shocking customer service at ASOS.  I basically received a £5 voucher to be used from ASOS for customer loyalty... pah!  I went online and placed an order but it failed to complete.  When I tried to reorder and use the voucher it said it had since been used, clearly it hadn't as the prior order failed to complete.  When chatting with the customer service agent(s), they treat you like a criminal asking for screenshots to be sent, eventhough its clear as day on the profile that the voucher had been redeemed with no order complete.  Stay away from ASOS, they treat you poorly, don't know what loyalty is.  Time to defect to other brands that actually know what customer care means!"

I sent two tops back to exchange into smaller sizes, however as they didn't have a smaller sizes in stock they proceeded to give me a refund. The tops were worth £40 however I only received a £10 refund. Perplexed I called the customer service team and apparently because I used a discount code they could only offer me a refund of £10 which is ridiculous. I asked them to send me the tops back as I didn't intend to get a refund I was merely asking for an exchange but they said this wasn't possible. I feel like I have been robbed of £30. The terms and conditions are not clearly communicated. This has been a terrible experience and I am questioning if I'll ever shop on ASOS again.  I've read a couple of reviews further down and it seems lots of people are having the same issue, I review of your processes is definitely needed."
"April 20, 2018",1,If I could give zero I would,If I could give zero I would. Extremely awful customer service placed an order for a dress I wanted and was told after waiting one week for my item to arrive that there was a problem with the courier they has used (Hermes) and I would have to wait up to another week for my dress to arrive. I waited until the said date and went on to track my order to see that my item was on its way back to Asos from the Hermes sorting hub. I contacted asos again to be told there was nothing they could do and i would be automatically refunded within 5 days of the warehouse receiving my order and that I could just order another on the site. This was all very good but the dress I had ordered in now out of stock. Asos you have shocking customer service and you have lost a customer for life I will not be using you again. Your staff were so unhelpful.
"April 20, 2018",5,Excellent customer service,"I honestly cannot fault ASOS customer service, they have been extremely helpful, I bought 6 bridesmaids dresses a year ago for my wedding this June and noticed 2 dresses had different colour embellishment to the other 4 dresses, as you can imagine I panicked & ordered new dresses, I emailed customer service and they advised I could send them back for inspection to which I did as they still had the tags in, they refunded me for the dresses, so helpful & kind of them to give me the option of returning them, 100% excellent customer service by all assistants I dealt with especially Julius, thank you."
"April 20, 2018",1,Worst Return Services,"Worst Return ServicesI returned my dress a month ago and have not received the refund or the confirmation from ASOS. I reached out to their customer services after waited for two weeks, and they told me someone else would contact me. And two weeks after (today), I still didn't receive any emails from them, so I contacted them again. I was told to show them ""a proof of postage"". I had a big order, so a pre-paid return label was included. I used that one and drop the return package in the UPS office. What would the ""proof"" be?! I online shop a lot, and it's the first time I was questioned if I was lying about the return. Very disappointed."

ASOS is the best website and customer service I have ever encountered. I just began shopping with them about a month ago and I have already made two orders. A few items in my second order did not fit, the return is so easy and completely free. Once they got my return (about a week from the time I sent it back,) they sent me an email keeping me posted on getting my return, what the items were, how much will be returned to my card and in how many days. They make online shopping, and the most annoying part- returns- SO simple. Very pleased with this site and I will be ordering from them again. Not to mention, their clothes are amazing!"

I’ve waited no longer than 5 days for my 3 dresses to arrive and I was very pleased when I opened the package. They looked almost the same as on the model, they were all safely wrapped and they were all a perfect fit. While waiting for the dresses, I also had a tracking service sent to me by e-mail which made it super easy for me to track my package. Great service and very nice clothes! Definitely will be ordering again in the future!"

"April 18, 2018",1,Worst Customer Service Ever Expierenced,"The bride picked a dress off this site for all the bridesmaids to wear in her wedding, I being one of them. Each of us ordered the dress on the same day and mine was the only one that didn't come on time. Given that it is impossible to chat to a live person at ASOS, I opted to use the live chat option. I was told to wait 3 weeks before contacting them again for ""postal delays"" and when I expressed concern with this given that I needed the dress 2 months from now at the LATEST, they were vague in response and never directly addressed the issue. The only direct response I could get was to wait the 3 weeks and they would ""look into it."" When I continued to push the issue the customer service rep ended the chat on me. Absolutely horrible service. I will not be shopping here again."
"April 18, 2018",5,Have been shopping here for 4ever!,I have been shopping at Asos for about 5 years now. The only problem I had ever had was they sent me the wrong dress in 2014. Since then I've bought something probably 2 times a month and it always comes when they estimate it as well as I track it and its always on time.  Everything else is perfect as well.
"April 17, 2018",1,Awful costumer service,"It’s a great page to find different clothing pieces. And that’s the only good thing. For days now all I have is problem with them. I have never expirences wkrse costumer service.First of all you only have options of a chat( which just goes off and you can’t longer write messages and no one bother to contact you) then email and Facebook. You can not personally speak to someone.On Wednesday  I became a prime delivery member just so I would receive and important gift by Saturday. Well I received 2/3 pieces that I ordered the third were women shoes instead of a man T-shirt. I contacted them immediately and they lady I “texted” with said I am sorry but mistakes happen you can have that order in a week. I explained that I don’t need it in a week but tomorrow and that that’s why I paid 15€ shipping all she said is I m sorry but that’s all I can offer you. I said I wanna cancel that since now I have to go and personally buy a T-shirt and she said you will only get your refund when you return us the shoes. So let me be clear I pay next day shipping I wait at home for the order it came wrong and they offered no help instead I now have to due to their mistake go to the post office send them a package so I will get the money back for the T-shirt that I never got. I was so foolish to order again from them, this time the delivery arrived when I wasn’t at home and they left it’s at some laundry place that’s 30 min away from me. I spent two days trying to communicate to them that it’s not ok to deliver something so far and that if I had time to go around for things I wouldn’t be ordering online, the answer from them was that If i don’t pick it up they ll take it back and it will be a couple of weeks to get my money back. So pretty much just bad and awful experiences with ASOS. I have never written a review before but this company makes me so angry. I became a premium member to be able to receive my orders next day and all I have is wrong orders or orders delivered far from my house. The worst thing is that they don’t care about their costumers, at all! I happen to know a thing or two about online sales and how other company handle it and the attention they give to their costumer satisfaction. If I could rate them with 0 I would!"

"April 17, 2018",1,What a disappointment,"I've never had major issues with the company until my last order. They had an offer and depending on the amount of your order you could have used a promo code for a discount. GIMME50 GIMME75 GIMME100My total allowed me to use GIMME100. Some of the clothes didn't fit and I needed to return them. Instead of calculating the discount for each item (including the ones that I kept - the majority) before refunding they completely removed the discount, taking it off the refund. Other than being not fair, since the discount applied to all of the items, they wouldn't even recalculate the discount for the new amount. ""Our policy doesn't allow us to do so"". As their policy was imposed on them by some other entity.ASOS always seemed to me a company very similar to Amazon, which tries to establish a long term trust with its users, so to become the first choice today and in the future. This was an unprofessional move and they won't see me back. Just sent a request to delete my account as well. I might be just another customer, but you're just another retail website in an ocean of options.Good luck."

Neither of which were of any help to me with a wedding the next morning. Requested refund which I got for items but not shipping sent another email to get my shipping no apologies and then I lost money (€4.08) due to currency exchanges ok not a huge amount but I guess €4 to discover a site is rubbish is a small price to pay."

Delivery was late, customer center doesn't help at all, package and box of the watch was damaged and they didn't see problem in that (it cost 90£).

Royal mail said item received on tracking but they are still waiting for something from them and now order is still stuck at the mail centre. Neither Asos nor Royal Mail can advise where my parcel is and if not received in 5 days its deemed as lost, yet this is the second time its happened and the reason for me not shopping there. No contact number for them and chat is useless, iv also emailed them and no response. I believe Asos are not been upfront about the delivery times and are misleading customers."

I have already addressed my issue with them and they don't want to admit their mistake and wanted me to wait for another 2 weeks. Customer service wasn't helpful at all and kept on saying the same thing.

Ordered 3 pairs of shorts on March 18th, order was processed March 20th and expected delivery date was April 9th. It’s April 13th and I got a 3 week trip in a couple days. Now I’m scrabbling looking for shorts and got a back load of work and gotta do before I jet off. Thought I f**kin’ covered this task 24 days ago! How do reputable brands trust this website to sell their goods?! I’ll be reaching out to these brands to check their account holders selling their product. How do I do this? Easy, social media. They’re putting their brands reputation on the line with the angry audience ASOS has captured. Contacted a customer service representative (you can’t be mad at these employees) but I was told I should receive the package around April 27th. Too late f**kers!"

I still haven’t received them. Talk to CS over FB messenger and they are/were completely useless. All they do is repeat themselves. I’ve been asking for a refund and it seems like they are just beating around the bush. I don’t normally write reviews but i’m appalled at how awful they are. Overall, save your money and don’t ever shop here. It’s not worth your time."
"April 13, 2018",1,Horrible experience,"Horrible experience! Ordered a bra. Got sent a top. Customer service sent it out again and guess what, I received the same top! I had had enough by this point so just excercised my right to a refund so I could purchase elsewhere. But they were holding my money captive until they had the tops back in their possession which I'mPretty sure is illegal as I haven't received what I paid for AND I didn't technically have to return the tops at all, as they were delivered to me, with my name on the parcel, they fall under unsolicited goods. But I did want to return the tops, but it takes time to process the refund, which they wouldn't do until they were physically back in their possession, (so would have to wait for it to get to them), they broke consumer contract law here by making my refund of the incorrect item conditional on ther physical possession of the incorrect goods. Customer service were downright nasty. I asked them why they weren't following consumer contract regulations and they kept bleating about their own 'policy'. Well sorry asos but your policy doesn't override the LAW! I informed them of this, but all I got back was 'it's not our policy' Staff were downright awful to deal with throughout the whole situation! I shall be taking this to whoever is in charge of consumer law. AVOID AVOID AVOID"

"April 12, 2018",1,Worst customer service,"Worst customer service. Paid for premium delivery, however doesn't show on my account. The guy promised that it would be sorted and that if I placed an order and paid for next day delivery it would be refunded. This was Feb, it is now April. I have spoken to five people from asos, all promise to resolve the matter however no refund has been issued and I still can't see the premium delivery (not that I would use ASOS again now anyway!). Very disappointed as have used ASOS many times before."
"April 12, 2018",5,Amazing premier shipping!,"I order from Asos ALL the time - it’s my first port of call for online shopping because they carry so many brands. I have the premier delivery, I have order things at 10:30pm and it has been delivered at 9:30am the next day - less than 12 hour turn around is unbelievable! They also have a points system so the more you spend, the more points you receive and then you get a £5 voucher when you get 500 points which is awesome. Most of the negative reviews seem to be from international shipping problems but I’m UK based so I’ve never experienced any problems - if anything it’s better than any other company I order from!"

I love their clothes and cheap prices.I would also like to thank costumer service for the great experience after Christmas, as I received a faulty item. I got a quick response and all of my money back - and I didn't even have to return the shirt, just ""dispose of it in the most environmentally friendly way possible"".Only good vibes from Denmark!"
"April 12, 2018",1,Horrid Experience,"I ordered a suit for prom and I noticed it was heading to a wrong address in a different state. As any person would I panicked and quickly tried to navigate to a contact page, however there is no call center and by the time an agent responds it’s apparently to late to do anything. I asked the agent, Ashley, to speak to a manager or supervisor and she said that it was impossible as there were none available. Who is in charge? Monkeys? Aliens? Robots? Who knows, because it’s been 2 days and I still have yet to find out. She said to contact the carrier. I then received an email address from Ashley to be able speak to someone else named Joe in the company, which as far as I know isn’t any position higher than Ashley. I was told they cannot cancel an order even tho it hasn’t left the facility and for 11hrs it sat there in there warehouse but couldn’t be stopped! Thus far  there’s no management team, no control over or communication ability between company and warehouse and no call center. At this point I’m done dealing with ASOS, so I call the delivery company and asked to have the package rerouted or returned and they very nicely by the way, amazing customer service, say I they need to be called by ASOS because only the shipper can request those things. I thank the lady and email ASOS again stating that they have the ability to cancel or reroute and all they have to do is contact the delivery company that was expecting a call from them to correct this mistake-turned-nightmare. I then receive an email from a different man from ASOS named Andrew, who basically says despite the fact that the delivery company says that they certainly do have the ability to reroute or cancel an order and are anticipating a call from them that they basically cannot help me and that there’s no way to cancel. Which makes me wonder if anyone in that company cares about its customers or owns a phone?! As of now I’m still waiting for a reply and I most likely will not be able to have this beautiful suit for prom and the package is being delivered to a random person who hopefully will enjoy it as I payed for it with my hard earned dollars. Terrible experience and goes to show that there’s nothing there willing to do to help a customer."

I find this is easiest by tweeting (and on direct message) on twitter and also facebook! Replies are so fast.I ordered a pair of high heeled boots for £40 and unfortunately they got very scratched after one night of wearing them. (This is unusual because normally everything from ASOS is such great quality). I messaged customer services on twitter and they told me to return the item and put it down as faulty. I returned and got my money back!They originally offered to send me a new pair but they were sold out so I was fully refunded. This was so quick and easy to sort out, I have no idea why people experience so many problems. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!!! <3"

I explained this to one girl on there and she says to email them at 10pm so I emailed at 10 to have terms and conditions wrote out to me. Someone telling me about my card and date of birth. Then to be told I should wait until Friday to receive it then no sorry “double checked, get back to us if you’ve not received it by the 18th” nearly 2 weeks after it was purchased!!! So much for 3 days and there so called estimated delivery. Quick enough to take your money though 😂 as always. Won’t be ordering ever again."

"April 08, 2018",1,Worst f***ing costumer service,"I love ASOS' selection, they have free shipping and great payment options. Big minus for me is having to pay for the return, it's quite expensive from Norway. I contacted ASOS about getting my return fee refunded, and he told me that would be no problem! He told me to hold onto the chat reference number, so I could get the money back. He was lovely!Later, I spoke with a woman in the chat. She was utterly rude! She talked to me like I was stupid, you have to f***ing understand that I'm asking you BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER!!! She told me there was no way I could get my money back. I rarely experience service this poor, one telling me one thing and then the other being rude and telling me something different!It has put me off wanting to buy anything else."
"April 08, 2018",1,Appalling and unhelpful customer service team,"Extremely annoyed with ASOS! I ordered a pair of shoes size UK 4 to be delivered to Singapore. Firstly I had to pay $40 duties for them, when the arrived they sent me size 6 US, which is a 3UK. When I contacted  CS, I was told that I had picked the wrong size even though I have been ordering size UK4 shoes on ASOS all the time!! Then she refused to give me an Exchange as I’m in Singapore  and told me I had to return the item and reorder. NO WHERE on their product page did it say that the brand was actually US and used US sizing and that you were suppose to choose from US sizing. Further to this I was told that I had to go to the US site to actually find out what the US size was for these shoes!!! Their size conversion is completely wrong for US shoe sizes. When I told them this, they were adamant that they had got it right.   Appalling and unhelpful customer service!!!i was a loyal shopper with ASOS and even continued shopping with them after moving to SG. But I’m no longer going back to them!"

"April 07, 2018",1,Worst brand ever.,"Just had the worst customer service experience of my life. Shipped my order. Didn’t arrive the day it was supposed to. Told it would be the next day. I delay a trip away by a day so I can collect items, which were needed for a shoot. The next day when the items were due to arrive, ASOS emails me thanking me for returning the items and they’ll be refunding me. Ummmm. I didn’t return the items. I didn’t even receive the items. I’ve now lost a day of my trip but also no longer have the items (three tee shirts) for a shoot. After three failed attempts to find someone to talk to on the live chat (one person bailed on me before I could even type anything. They saw the order number and clearly knew they messed up and didn’t want to deal with it), I spoke to ‘Chloe’ who apologised for their mistake but there was nothing they could do. They value me as a customer and want me to be happy. The emptiest of empty corporate responses. Having bought from ASOS for years and years. And recommended friends to use them when they weren’t well known, I regret giving them my loyalty and money over the years. They’re too big to give a damn. It’s sad, ASOS used to be great. Should point out I live in london, UK. Easy place to deliver to and communicate with someone. They did neither. Appalling brand and customer service. Actually impressive how dreadful this experience was."
"April 07, 2018",1,I placed an order for $154,"I placed an order for $154, two minutes after I realized there was a code for a free two-day shipping if you spend over $120. I thought it's going to be automatically applied since that made more sense but I needed to enter the code. I contacted customer service and asked if my order can be shipped express since I spent over $120 so I don't have to cancel and re-order and the rep said ""there is nothing we can do, your order is scheduled for standard shipping"" It was just a small thing that I asked for and they wouldn't bother to help. I worked in an online business and shipping and I know that is something that could've been done.  Such a bad customer service and I don't know if I want to order again from a company that doesnt have good customer service."

"April 06, 2018",1,I just had the WORST experience,"I just had the WORST experience.  I  updated the shipping and billing address on my account since moving to a new country.  I purchased 2 items and saw in my confirmation email that they billed my new billing address but are shipping to my old address.  I spoke to their customer support via chat and was told that since 1 hour had past since my order was purchased, they could not check on the shipping address or update it and it will just have to be sent to the one in the confirmation email.  This was THEIR mistake and they were not willing to check and make sure it's sent to the address I had updated on my account.  I don't know who lives at my old address and how do I know they won't take the package? I didn't want to cancel, I just wanted to make sure they update the address.  I can't believe that they had a mistake and wouldn't do anything.  They said my option was to either purchase AGAIN and I hope the same mistake doesn't happen, and also hope that whoever gets my package will say they're not me and send it back.  WHAT KIND OF CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THAT? I'm a loyal customer for YEARS and this is the first time I've seen a glitch in their online shopping flow.  This happened just over 1 hour from me purchasing, and they said there is nothing they can do."
"April 06, 2018",5,Amazing all round!,"Amazing!! Super fast delivery. I bought some boyfriend jeans in the petite size. I have never ever bought a pair of jeans that fit me perfectly but these do. I’m so happy with them, a bit pricey but extreamly worth it. Thank you!!!x"

Then, I returned both items because the bottoms I ordered didn't fit and of course I didn't need the other bottom. The second strike was that I was only refunded for one of the items. Luckily, I emailed customer service and they got back to me right away. They made sure I was refunded for my total purchase. I really appreciate how fast they responded and took action. I'm also glad they include the free return shipping label -- that's awesome! So, thank you to Karis from ASOS customer service for helping me out. :)"
"April 05, 2018",1,Terrible online chat customer service,"Terrible online chat customer service. I didn't' receive my student promotion code email. So I started chatting online with Aaron.

Then he just quit!!! End the chat after I send his my ID. Then I started chat again, another guy. I asked why Aaron quit chat after I send him my ID. He didn't say anything, but just ask me send him my ID again. I send again with my photo covered. He said he need the picture of ID without any information covered. He said my information is safe with them. I said Facebook said the same thing. I said the picture has both my name and expiration date on it uncovered. He said he cannot help me anymore. Without my student ID with full information they cannot give my student discount. Fine. That's totally terrible."

"April 05, 2018",1,No Care at all,"Hi Team, I am concerned as the last four orders I have placed with ASOS have seen items that seem to be too small being sent.  At first I panicked thinking that I have gained A LOT of weight as I have had weight issues, but then I had a friend who is an AUS 10/12 try it and it fit her perfectly, albeit the sleeves were still a bit small in some of the items. I am a size AUS18 and it seems like your clothing sizes have shrinked massively.The dresses I ordered in orders no. 317933792 & no. 316936444 were so small that my size 10 friend could fit into them.Previous to that Order No. 306884879 & No. 306121609 where also returned due to clothes not fitting properly.If you have changed the sizing of your clothing, please let everyone know because a supposedly size 18 item fitting a size AUS 10/12 body is very wrong.Please advise if you have changed your sizings. As a larger lady, I love the ASOS Plus size brands and Asos Curve, but it is not a nice feeling ordering something in that section, receiving it and it's too small not because you have gained weight but because sizings have been changed. It really leaves a sour taste and makes you feel like rubbish. especially if you are someone struggling with weight.I also started a chat conversation in which the agent wasn't helpful at all. Please look into this too. I have attached screenshots of the conversation.  She made me feel VERY awkward and she wasn't at all friendly. ---------------------------------------------She then proceeded to respond to the above email complaint I sent with a scripted message and I told her, that ""​I would like you to pass this message on to someone else since you are the person in the chat service who didn't actually help. I have worked in a customer service centre and I am sure it's unethical of you to take on a case that s about you. Forward my email to a manager and I will await their response."" She didn't pass it on and I sent another email asking for help and she sent the same scripted response but just changed the name in it. Can someone actually assist me or it this how you train for customer care people???"
"April 04, 2018",1,NEVER order from ASOS,"Their payment processing is terrible and when I had to go back to ""order again"" the order disappears and you have to re-add everything to the shopping cart. Even though I ordered before a promo code expired, because of the payment issue, when I had to reorder, the promo code wouldn't work. They wouldn't do anything to assist a customer. I will NEVER order from ASOS again. When there are so many online clothing companies looking to help, this one says FU to it's customers."
"April 04, 2018",1,ASOS sent me the wrong item: TWICE,"ASOS sent me the wrong item, when I contacted them they agreed to resend the item however when it arrived it was the wrong item again. When I contacted them they said they would again resend and would confirm within 24hours. 24 hours later they contacted me to say it was no longer in stock so unlucky me and i would need to return the two incorrect items they sent me in order for me to get my money back on an item I didn't get. Each time I contacted customer service I was responded to by a different member of staff so there was no coherency in the conversation. Literally don't care about the customer loosing out for their mistakes. Sad when a company gets to that size where it no longer cares about the customer experience."
"April 03, 2018",1,Items received never matched items shown on website,Colours of items received never match the colours in the picture. Must be highly edited and saturation boosted. Very annoying
"April 02, 2018",1,It’s fair to say I shall never use…,"It’s fair to say I shall never use asos’ services again, nor would I recommend them to anybody. I order a suit two weeks before an event I needed it for, however they sent the suit 2 sizes too big. So I sent it back and had requested for them to send me back the correct size before the event, they told me that this was an acceptable request and they would try to achieve this. The day before the event (the day I had given them to send me the suit jacket) and I had not heard any email to say they could not do the request, which they couldn’t because it had not came. So I decided, to re-order the jacket on next day delivery. However, the jacket they had sent this time was a size too small. This was completely unacceptable in my opinion, not only had they sent the wrong item twice but also gave extremely slow return service. To follow on from this, they told me they would give me a refund on my next delivery immediately. Which they have never done. As well as this, they said they would give me a 15% discount code, which in my opinion is an embarrassment of an apology considering they had a 20% offer on for all students. So I would be able to use a bigger discount from being a student then their discount for their horrendous service. For anybody even contemplating using their services I would advise you not to and just pay that extra bit for a reliable service else where."
"April 02, 2018",1,Used to be good but grew to fast.,I'm ASOS VVIP and spend about £3-4k a year there but I've finally given up. Absolutely awful customer service - never apologetic for their problems (eg click and collect orders you go to collect and they are not in the store). Think they grew too fast but didn't keep up with maintaining levels of service and there are better places to buy from. Am now deleting my account. Bye ASOS!

After waiting 7 days for them to acknowledge they had received these disgusting quality items back I am yet still another 8 days later still not received my refunds and just keep getting fobbed off by there disgusting and poor customer service.

Next day another order not delivered because of an error even though I double checked on it after the first error. Customer services kept cutting me off on live chat even though the second error proved my worries correct. Terrible experience, quicker and easier to go to the shops. Delivery charges refunded (although we'll have to see if that actually happens) but even after all the hassle and the mistakes that was the best they could do apparently. I bet rivals of this company must be happy knowing they could clean up with decent customer service and reliable delivery. Simple."

Their agents don't listen, it does not matter what you told previously or you ask, they repeat the same policy that blame their customers or couriers making them responsible for everything. They misinform and waste your time unable to offer any solution. I was told that I should talk with ParcelConnect to figure out my tracking number. I spent hours calling and writing them for discover that since I used an ASOS return label, ASOS is who generated the tracking number instead ParcelConnect. I was told ParcelConnect may be able to give me a copy of my receipt what again was not true, etc, etc.Summarizing if you send a parcel through ParcelConnect using an ASOS return label scanned by Payzone anyone keep record. They have poor IT systems that apparently generate unique tracking numbers associated to unique order numbers randomly, and even when their customers pay and buy online, in 2018, instead saving all their relevant information in the cloud or in the website, they can only offer a small piece of paper printed by a third party, as warranty to them. Terrible customer experience and useless customer service."

"March 27, 2018",5,So impressed!,"I bought 179 dollars worth of stuff from ASOS for the first time. I qualified for two day shipping. I kept getting emails and text updates  telling me exactly where my package was and it arrived right on time! I was so nervous about the quality of the clothes bc I had never shopped here before. I have to say I'm more than impressed! I'm plus size so it's hard for me to find clothes that fit with good quality thick material and ASOS impressed me. Their stuff looks and feels well made and it fit beautifully. Every single thing with my first order went beautifully! I'm so happy! I'm sorry for everyone who has a bad experience, but if you're new to the site like me I would definitely try it and don't let the comments scare you!"
"March 27, 2018",1,Poor customer service,I have been charged for premium delivery and they failed to deliver on time. Not even within a week? Ridiculous. Why to charge for something which you can't offer!

"March 25, 2018",1,Evil people,"Ive always been an avid asos user, its always my go to place and ive been a premier member for 3 years, however I cannot support this company any more. I know theyve always been happy to selll products that have been tested on animals, but to now actively persue a contract with MAC who really are the flagship company when it comes to torturing beagles and animals alike, i have to take that as asos actually wanting to hurt these animals, not just ignoring it."
"March 24, 2018",5,Why are the ratings so low???,"Why are the ratings so low? I’ve always had great experiences with ASOS. I’ve bought a couple dresses, a jacket and a pair of vans  throughout the years and it’s always been a smooth transaction. I get my stuff quick and it look and feels great! Especially being a curvy girl with a small top, their sizing is pretty much true to size, if not giving an inch or two."
"March 24, 2018",2,Awful delivery and customer service,"Awful delivery and customer service. I placed a order and waited to receive my email to say it was ready for collection. When i went to the store it wasn't there and this has happened another 3 times since. The tracking for this parcel is a joke from the 5th of this month to today i am still receiving emails to say my parcel is out for delivery. I have contacted customer service 2 times and they haven't been any help at all. I think it's disgusting that you cannot actually speak to someone on the phone like other company's, it makes the whole process harder. I was told i would be contacted about a refund within 48 hours which still hasn't happened. All i want is my money back, the items i ordered were for a party which has been and gone. I will never shop with Asos again which is a shame because it was always a firm favourite of mine.UPDATE:I have finally got my refund after contacting @Asosheretohelp on Twitter who were very helpful"
"March 24, 2018",1,Shocking CS team - awful conduct and solutions.,"ASOS had a tech fault and cancelled my order without notifying me. No email in my junk OR inbox - I check both everyday for work emails. However, the money did come out of my PayPal account and I DID receive 2 emails saying My order WAS placed and that my order would be with me in a few days - so obviously I’m going to think my order is placed and it’ll be with me in a few days. Crazy thought process I know..The day before the parcel was due, I went on my ASOS account and saw it said “cancelled”. So I had to chase the CS team about my order and ask ASOS if my order was still coming? Because, again, I had 2 emails telling me the order was placed and it would be with me by Saturday. So this was totally news to me!! The huge inconvenience for me was that the items in the order were for my Mum’s birthday and I had used a 20% code at the time of ordering - which was now expired. I had ordered them at the start of the week to come on or before Saturday - in time for her birthday. But saw it was cancelled on Friday (the day before delivery). I spoke to the CS team via Online Help Chat and I was told ASOS had a tech glitch. I was told to “Just order all items again” - but the items I initallly ordered were now out of stock and now would not be here in time for my Mum’s birthday. The CS team via Online Help Chat assured me tech glitches are extremely rare - but in the same breath, they said I should’ve been checking my Inbox and Junk for emails telling me they had cancelled my order? Which again - was an email I never received in my Inbox or Junk - I double checked. The only emails I received were confirmation emails that the Order was placed, and another with the date it would arrive. Anyway, the only consolation I was offered - despite them confirming the tech issue was on their side - was to get the 20% code back (that I had used in the order that had been cancelled). Not good enough considering how much I was messed about by ASOS and how put out I was last min. I was now faced with the inconvenience of not having anything to give my Mum the next day because it wouldn’t get here in time - despite ordering 5 days in advance. And I now couldn’t get the items she wanted as they were out of stock. My 20% code back doesn’t really solve anything or leave me anywhere near satisfied. The CS staff member on twitter asked me to explain the situation. So I did and said ASOS customer service is a joke - to which ASOS replied, telling me to “Refrain from spamming”. Yet in the same breath, said they love feedback and always want to improve. I didn’t swear or say anything out of turn. Therefore, I didn’t appreciate passive aggressive comments. I work in customer service myself - and that’s unacceptable. Instead of saying “Don’t Panic” you’re trained to say “Keep Calm” - saying “Refrain from spamming” is a rude trigger phrase, inadvertently accusing me of spamming. Also, considering how unreliable and unprofessional ASOS have been creating this situation and how they handled it after - I have every reason to feel ASOS have let me down and I am firm but fair when explaining this. And yes - I will write a lot when the CS team on Twitter ask me to DM them explaining the situation. So don’t accuse me of “spamming”. ASOS should definitely train their Twitter CS staff on how to speak to people (because they aggravated the situation and made it 10x worse) and CS Online Help Chat team to offer reasonable solutions. Apparently the big problem solver was to give me back the 20% code that I had used in the order that got cancelled - TERRIBLE consolation, considering the issue was confirmed on ASOS end. Also a bit of a joke, considering how much I was inconvenienced by their problem, messed around, and spoken to by their (twitter CS) staff. Offering me my own discount code back was a total slap in the face and it made me think ASOS don’t take the issue seriously if they think that is satisfactory. Offering me my code back isn’t reasonable and doesn’t leave me satisfied at all - I would’ve thought that’s the LEAST they could do - but what good is giving me my discount code back when I won’t get the items I ordered (because they’re now out of stock) and I now won’t get anything in time for my mums birthday - despite having emails promising me they’d be here by now and the email confirming the order was definitely placed. ASOS are unprofessional and unreliable and I expected - at the very least - a notification telling me my order had been cancelled, and a WAY better solution for the inconvenience. I am still left SO unsatisfied!"

"March 23, 2018",1,AVOID live chat is awful. No Customer Service skills at all.,Nothing but bad experiences with live chat! This has happened twice now. (At least they are consistent!) They lack Customer Service skills. Why have the option for a live chat if it is not helpful (Becky was very unhelpful and kept using her macros rather than a personal touch). Could not do anything....even to confirm if an order was cancelled after waiting the 15mins it takes to show as cancelled on their system... it's a risk to purchase through ASOS.co.uk for fear of having a problem as the CS is non-existent.
"March 23, 2018",1,"Item delivery attempted once, then returned to ASOS","Item delivery attempted once, then sent back to sender as I wasn't in. Reason given was that it was incorrectly addressed when the address I provided was correct. They can't just resend it to me, or even an alternative address. I have to wait up to 17 days to get my order refunded then order the item again. Or I could just order them again now and be out of pocket, but quite frankly I don't see why I should do that. I won't be using ASOS again - if they can't chose a delivery provider capable of making deliveries (in this case it was Royal Mail so why they didn't leave it at the Royal Mail delivery office for me to just collect is beyond me) then I won't be shopping with them."

Am I paying for the rare off chance that it could potentially arrive next day? it's convenient that they blame the courier for delays, the question is who chose the courier in the first place? I'm glad Amazon Prime sell clothing items on the side since they were actually capable of delivering on time."
"March 22, 2018",5,nothing to be worried about,"I have never really ordered clothes online and was extremely hesitant due to some terrible reviews i’ve seen of asos, but i decided to trust the good reviews and make a purchase. Because my order was over $120 (i spent $231) I was given free 2-day shipping (and I live in Texas) so I was skeptical that it would actually arrive on time, but I am more than happy that it arrived exactly when it said it would. I think that is so impressive. I bought 4 pairs of pants which all fit perfectly. The only thing I will say about them is that according to the “the model is 5”7 wearing a size 4” “84% of people with your body type purchased size 4 and didnt return it”, I’m almost positive it would not have fit had I gotten the recommended size. I only sized up because my recommended size was out of stock, but it ended up being the perfect choice and I’m shocked with how well everything looks on. I can’t say anything about the customer service because I didn’t have to return anything, but hopefully my next purchases will go just as smoothly as my first. All of the pieces felt good quality and not cheap at all. I’m very happy with asos and I felt that I should leave a review for anyone wondering if it’s worth their time and money. It is!!"
"March 22, 2018",1,Wish I could give zero stars,"Wish I could give zero stars. I put in an order 3 weeks in advance for when I needed the items and was quoted the the arrival would be there within the week. About 2 and a half weeks later they were still in transit in New York and I wouldn't be able to get them by when I needed them, but don't worry they refunded my $3.00 delivery charge (gee thanks). Please don't order from this terrible website, they charge you for a terrible delivery service that isn't held accountable."

"March 20, 2018",1,Wow asos bad,Wow. What can i say totally disgusted with asos and the delivery company they use. Ordered two items seprate and after spending 2 days off work waiting for non delivery the company even claims to attempt to.deliver when no attempts have been made. Now im asos exspect me to wait for my delivery that is with the courier already to wait till the 29th of this month. Told them this is not exceptable and im not willing to wait and they claim its all.they can use. Add aswell i have ordered 2 more dresses before 1 was ok needed alterations but the other looked terrible. The bow was done so terrible my 9 year old makes better had to completely gut it and sort it out with a seamstress . Avoid
"March 20, 2018",1,Awful,"No exchanges, and if you need to send something back and use a coupon code you’re only refunded minus the coupon code. Do not shop here they’re such a horrible company.

"March 20, 2018",4,Website you can Trust,"When I need to buy any clothes online, asos.com is one of those websites I can trust. I really like that they have video preview option of the item (which allows to see how the cloth would look like on a real person), checkouts are really easy and you get free delivery on all orders over £20. However, about 50% of the clothes I bought via asos.com did not fit me (everything was ok with sizes, just the clothes looked differently on me than on those tall slim models), so I needed to return the items. Returns are free and easy as well, therefore I find this website as really reliable. The only I would wish would be greater selection of clothes as well as using ""regular"" sized person for videos instead of those models. Maybe the clothes would not look so nice, but at least your returns rate would decrease significantly."

"March 19, 2018",1,Faulty Goods,Last week I placed an order for a Dune Evania Black Cross body bag for a friends birthday. The bag arrived broken and faulty and in a completely unacceptable condition especially since the bag is £65!! I have since gone onto the website to place another order in good faith and realised the bag is now out of stock. My friends birthday is today and is completely ruined due to the lack of quality assurance at ASOS. I am very upset about this as I have been an ASOS customer for many years and this has left a very sour taste in my mouth. I have been on the online chat and the agent has simply told me to return the faulty product to receive a refund. I am sorry but this is not acceptable to me. I have also not been given a method to make a formal complaint.

"March 18, 2018",2,"When they get your order wrong, you're on your own","Good products and it's all good... until something goes wrong. The standard of their customer service is far below what you would expect from a retailer of their size. Here’s a recent example: - They delivered me the wrong item. - I contacted them to let them know, and asked if I could also buy the incorrect item they sent. They said no, and said I couldn’t buy/keep it (citing ‘stock issues’). They said I had to return the item before they would send the correct order.- I returned the incorrect item the next day via their courier. They emailed me again 2 days later asking me to return it(?), and told that the item I was “hoping for” (i.e. that I had already ordered and paid for) was no longer available. There was no apology. - I then checked and the item I’d already bought was still on sale on their website in my size. I asked for it to be sent to me given that it was in stock, and they said no as 'stock levels can change throughout the day for different reasons'. They offered no other help other than directing me to similar products on their site.- I am still waiting for a refund 2 months later.It’s stupid really – the result is that despite having spent hundreds of pounds over the years in ASOS, I am never going to shop with them again. Even just a proper apology would have gone a long way."
"March 18, 2018",5,Good returns policy and good quality own brand products,"Always been very satisfied with their speed of delivery and returns process. I also lost my returns label and managed to order a hermes delivery pick-up with no fuss which was very appreciated - not something normally available on online shopping.Also, just bought their own brand petit range products for the first time and very happy - neckline sits very well which is rare for me so overall very pleased. Very good quality."
"March 18, 2018",1,Very bad customer service,"Very bad customer service, the lady on the phone was rude they didn't refund all of my money after returning the item. Waste of money and time. I'll never shop from ASOS again."

When i chatted with the customer care, they say there was a warehouse issue.

She emailed, no answer. She chatted with different people and found out that the item was received by Asos and 'something went wrong with the payment of the refund'. After every contact she would hear from them within 4 days. Nothing. Problem is: they have no email adress (just a contact form but one can't prove sending a message). Three times chatting persons promised to send my daughter an email. Nothing. Changed email adress, nothing, changed it back, nothing. Just now I tried to contact the customer service again. They said I had to contact the Dutch customer service, so I did. Guess what: no chats, just a contact form! And UK won't help me anymore! My daughter sent another email but she doesn't expect anything anymore.So be ware if you want to order something form ASOS.com, you might never get a refund!UPDATE 10-17-2018: After 11 months my daughter finally received her refund. I contacted the European Consumer Center and they had to contact them 4 four times before the refund was finally paid. May daughter supposed to have received two emails from ASOS, but guess: none reached her (not in spam either). No excuse, no explanation, nothing. So the 1 star remained!"

"March 14, 2018",1,Ridiculous Customer Support,"Been a long time customer of the ASOS company. Recently purchased a Mango leather jacket, on the Outlet section, which originally costed 270 euro and with the sale it dropped to 121. Bought it and got in a couple days. Fitted nice and well and noticed the Mango label had a sticker on it, hiding the price. Peeled it off and lo and behold, the price ORIGINALLY was 180. Deliberately ASOS raised the price another 90 euros on top. Being a customer and business owner, I felt like I was cheated out of the so called ''outlet sale''. Contacted via email, Emma from support was very helpful and asked photos for proof. I supplied the photos along with the Mango label and the 180 price tag and she said she'd look into it and see how to work it out.After 2 hours, an Indian dude called Kajal replied, instead of Emma, with the typical ''by the books'' robotic reply along the lines of  ''the price increases due to varying costs'' and he didn't even bother offering a solution. Dissatisfied with his reply, I told him that even I'll take this matter publicly on Facebook and Twitter to raise awareness of the so called ASOS ''OUTLET SALE'' .Good job ASOS for the crap support."
"March 14, 2018",5,Surprised!,I was very wary when ordering from this website due to all of the bad reviews I had seen however when I received the clothes they arrived before the estimated delivery and they were a really good fit and good quality. I have a hard time finding clothes due to how tall I am but honestly asos take tall people into consideration too. 100% would recommend to everyone.
"March 14, 2018",1,DO NOT SHOP AT ASOS,"I should have read the reviews here before I decided to spend $150 on 3 pairs of shoes at ASOS and lose over $80 in import fees and return costs! I ordered in my size and none of the shoes fit - they're all 1 - 2 sizes too big for me. I was charged import fees already as I am in Canada and found out that they do NOT do free returns for Canadian orders. I spoke with a CSR on Live Chat and she was unsympathetic and unhelpful. She copied and pasted answers and redirected me to their FAQ - why would I go on Live Chat if my questions could be answered by FAQ? I expressed that I was disappointed with their customer service especially as a first time shopper and she responded with ""is there anything else I can help you with?"". DO NOT SHOP HERE, it is NOT worth your time or money."

Do they speak ridiculously slow on purpose?!"
"March 13, 2018",1,If I could give less than one star …,"If I could give less than one star I would. They have no call center, probably because they do not have any customer service. They have promised me items ordered to come by March 8th and today is the 13th and they have still not arrived. I contacted them yesterday via chat and they said I should wait until 24th of March???? Over two weeks passed my expected delivery. I told them that I had plans for the clothes and have now missed the date and they’ve offered me no service to locate the items nor have they offered any compensation nor have they said they will remove the delivery charges. They have literally said nothing to me except that I should wait until the 24th of March. So horrible. They’ve lost me as a customer for sure. Worst mistake ordering from them, who knows if I’ll even get the items, maybe on the 24th they’ll tell me to wait until 2019."

I put in the wrong door number on accident, and once I reported to ASOS that I was unable to contact the local courier to redirect them to the correct address - and that they had blocked my phonecalls and become completely unresponsive - they took matters into their own hands and immediately sent me a replacement. This was on Thursday the 8th, and my replacement arrived to my office in Lisbon, Portugal just this morning. It was solved within a matter of minutes. I'm absolutely delighted over how they solved the problem, even thought it was entirely my own fault. Will buy from ASOS again, no doubt!"

It was the only one in my size and so I wanted to keep it and asked asos to pay for it to be professionally steamed/pressed. Took three days of me nagging before they conceded. Eventually they asked I send my proof of steam/pressing and they would credit my account. For the previous two days they had not budged. Threaten them with poor reviews here and watch them change!!"

"March 12, 2018",1,Customer service shambles! Avoid!,It’s a shame customer service is non existent with this company as they have a great product range. Have been sent broken items twice. Next day delivery never arrived. Parcel was never delivered and sent back to ASOS - basically told to order and pay again for the items wanted and refund would be issued once the original parcel received at ASOS (pay twice in other words) Items could not be reordered as now out of stock. All I wanted was the parcel to be sent out again when it arrived at the depot “not possible”. Thanks for going the extra mile to not help. The order was a gift. Won’t be using anymore.
"March 12, 2018",1,Shocking service!!,Ordered a few items of clothing and due to the snow and me being on holidays I asked for the order to be delivered on Saturday 12th March.  Parcel never turned up on Saturday.  Contacted DPD on Sunday 13th and was told to get in touch with ASOS.  Made contact with ASOS and was told that I would have to wait for DPD to try and find the order.  Would not reorder or refund my money.  Promised they would be in touch.  Parcel was delivered by DPD today and I am still waiting to hear from ASOS.  Spend your money elsewhere!!  Disappointing service!!

"March 12, 2018",1,Late Delivery Horrible Customer Service,"I ordered a maternity dress for an event two weeks prior to the event. When placing the order I was told the order should get to me on March 6th. When USPS updated their tracking it stated March 8th, which would have been ok since my event was the 10th. Low and behold March 8th came and went with no order. The order has still not arrived and its the 12th! Since it did not come in time for my event I had to make other arrangements for it, which is difficult since I am 8 months pregnant! I spoke with customer service via chat and all they could say was "" we apologize."" Stick with Amazon people, waaaaay better customer service and they take the customer's inconveniences in mind when issuing refunds. I will NEVER shop here again and I advise those who are reading this to shop elsewhere."
"March 12, 2018",1,The shoe sizing is way beyond…,"The shoe sizing is incorrect! I am a US size 5 1/2 which is equivalent so a UK size 3. I ordered a pair of ballet flats and loafers from ASOS in a UK 3 and when it came it looked like a US size 7! I tried it on and yep, it was huge! I thought they must have sent me the wrong size but nope it was correctly labeled as UK size 3. Please fix this because you have cute shoes!"
"March 11, 2018",1,Clothes fell apart second time wearing,"I recently purchased a few items from your company. I was very excited to find your website, there were many items that I was indeed interested in. My issues started when I made my order and was told that I would receive my things the following Monday, I did not receive my things until the following Thursday. This however was not something I was that upset about. I was overjoyed when I did finally receive my package, but was let down when the items I had ordered in a size XXL fit more like a Large. Yet this is not what the cause of this letter. Today, as I am sitting at work the button on the side of my overalls, that I purchased from your website, has literally fallen off. This is the second time I am wearing this item. I am extremely unsatisfied with my order and as much as I love many of your items I unfortunately will not be purchasing from your company again and it is unlikely that I would recommend your company to my friends and family."
"March 10, 2018",4,Ordered a maternity dress that was on…,Ordered a maternity dress that was on sale. There was also an additional percentage off if you used a code which I forgot to input on the first transaction. I realized it within 15 minutes and cancelled the order and reordered using the code. I used Paypal during both transactions and experienced no issues. The dress was beautiful quality when I received it and it arrived a few days earlier than expected. I received a ton of compliments on it. I would reorder from them in the future. ALWAYS use PAYPAL on these sites!
"March 10, 2018",1,ridiculous!!!,"If I could I'd give them a prize for the WORST customer support ever. I think that Siri would do the job better. To be honest, I don't think that's solely cs agents fault. They are put there to serve as punching bags without any real power to resolve the issues. My advice, try to find the same product somewhere else on the internet, you'll probably find it at the lower price and spare yourself from a potential misery."
"March 09, 2018",1,Speedy service with stolen credit card details.,As a non customer who found out my credit card was used on the site without permission and notifying them within 12 hours of the transaction occurring I was surprised to hear the order had been dispatched and not able to cancel. Still great service for the criminals! Then later receiving a request to fill in a survey form for the service I had received was beyond a joke. As a victim of fraud I now have to spend time away from work reporting the fraud to the police and the bank.

I made a screen capture with a number of reference and the customer service just said “so sorry to hear this... but we cannot do anything because you have no order with your email address”. The paiement is done. I send them all the informations and each time they say the same thing, and each time it is a different person who answers.They don’t want to give me back my money.It is like a robbery!!!!!!No more this website!!!!!!!!!! The customer service is pathetic..."
"March 07, 2018",1,Terrible and unhelpful customer…,Terrible and unhelpful customer service. I was sent the wrong item which in no way resembled my original item - not even close! Now the item I want is typically out of stock. The customer service via chat would not give me a straight answer in terms of stock availability just a pre-written robotic and arrogant response. No offer of compensation for now having to return an unwanted item and find an alternative. Very disappointed with ASOS and I have been a customer for many years!
"March 07, 2018",1,Terrible.,"What a bunch of clowns, They stuff my order up sending me the wrong stuff I message and complain and was told the most useless information about the return and was linked to their website. I asked for a call which they called the following day, and I was told the return will take 7 days to process and a further 10 days for the refund to come, They even had the nerve to try and sell me more things over the phone, what a complete joke these people are. Quick to take your money but slow in returning it when they've clearly stuffed up. I've never seen customer service so bad anywhere."

Never buying again from this joke of a place. Orders from boohoo and very arrived without any problem during the bad weather. However, I get a message from Asos saying ""delayed because of bad weather""."
"March 06, 2018",1,Worst company ever,"Worst company ever. Beware. Do not buy from them. After you have already paid for everything, even if you pay extra for express shipping (i did in my case) they will hit you with an additional $50 charge and refuse to give you your order until you pay the extra money. No option for refunds. Its sad how they pray on their customers and take advantage of them."
"March 06, 2018",1,Worst online store ever,"I place an order, I get no notification at all... after a week and a half I write a chat message at the help desk and they tell me they forgot to pack my order and now half of the items is out of stock. They tell me they will send me the rest of the items but I wanted to cancel it then and they just plainly told me that that's not possible anymore? So you can forget my order so that half of the items are out of stock but when I ask then to cancel my order it's suddenly not possible anymore even tough the items aren't even dispatched yet???"
"March 06, 2018",1,Orders went missing and yet no on inform me,"Ordered my item from ASOS on the 19th Feb item dispatched on the 20th by 6th Mar still haven't received my parcel. Live chat to only find out that item is lost and no one from ASOS updated me only when i ask for an update. The replacement delivery they offered is the standard international delivery meaning which i have to wait for another 10days! i couldnt believe that i have to wait for a month for my parcel. When i suggested that ASOS should be responsible for the replacement delivery with free express delivery service, the customer service officer could only repeat that damn standardize sentence of ""you will be charged for the delivery cost""Just what the crap man! Bad service with unreliable courier!!!!!"

On the 5th of March I wonder where my order landed. It was lost said the one zillion customer office. They will send it again but half of the products are sold out. No thank you, I either want a refund or the whole order. The idiots send it again. The legal explanation ""it has been sent"". I'll take that to the customer protection office. This company is a bad joke"

I spoke to one of their staff but the promocode had already expired. They told me they would return the money etc. and i would need to repurchase. I can’t even repurchase because the items are out of stock. I’m so annoyed. Literally handled so brashly. I’m given generic robotic answers and it was super unhelpful.
"March 02, 2018",1,This company is a Joke!!,This company is a Joke!!! I really have learnt my lesson never to shop at this dreadful website. I still can’t receive my refund in the amount of £110 for two awfully made cheap trench coats that I returned from the 18 Feb but instead getting messages from them on Twitter with false claims that they had done so. I am fed up of their unprofessional way of sorting out situations they don’t deserve not one star because their customer service is straight up trash!
"March 01, 2018",1,Poor customer service and delivery,We ordered an item but it never got delivered to the collection point because the collection point was closed!!!

"March 01, 2018",1,My two parcels went missing,My two parcels went missing. I sent several messages to ASOS and got no reply. Nothing. I tried so many times and zero.

The parcel was signed for by my colleagues and when I returned 3 weeks later it was unfortunately missing. ASOS helped me so much when I explained the situation and sent me a full refund as I couldn’t afford to repurchase the items ! Can’t tell you how supprised I was but so grateful! Thank you ASOS !
"February 27, 2018",1,Bad service and no orders,"Ordered clothes and an express service and paid extra for that,  but it never came and customer service didn't know why and after a week still nothing and after seriously many mails to their customer service and no feedback, I deleted the order. According to them my order was never handled by their system, and not packed. After a week I finally got my money back and was very disappointed. To much time chasing my order for nothing. A tip from me is to have a ""fast line"" for things like this so you don't loose your customers."
"February 26, 2018",1,Never again,"The worst online shopping experience ever. Shipped too late even though I paid $14 for 2 day-delivery, arrived on the following Tuesday instead on Saturday. Customer service was unwilling to do anything about it. When I sent the shoes back 3 weeks ago for refund, never heard from them again. Just terrible!"
"February 26, 2018",5,ASOS is my favourite place to shop.,"ASOS is my favourite place to online shop. I rarely have complaints about ASOS. The clothes are generally good quality. The brands that are stocked are great and the plus size range, in particular, is ideal. You get a great mix of the basics and fancier items. Everything is fairly priced, the premier delivery service is perfect and I love how the majority of orders are sent with DPD."
"February 26, 2018",1,Train your customer serivces!!,"Their customer serivce is literally SHOCKING!!! Please go on their Twitter page to see how unproffesional they are, they arent even sure if they stock dildos?! Imagine. They all tell you different things and I am now left having to wait 7 days for £150. (For a parcel I have never received.) They absolutely have no idea what they are doing.Warning: If your parcel is returned to sender, you have to wait 7 days for the warehouse to receive it, and then 3-5 days for the refund to process. Considering they can see you have never received the parcel to begin with, they should refund you as soon as the tracking shows they are going to receive it back. It is such a shame as I really like their clothing and online shopping is really convenient."
"February 25, 2018",1,"Terrible experience, AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!","Wish I had the option of giving zero stars. Bought a faux leather jacket in a large from the site; they accidentally sent me a small. No sweat, I thought, I’ll just return it and have them re-send me it in the correct size, or so I thought. They informed me that as I was receiving said small, the large option for the piece sold out, and was no longer available. Mildly peeved at this point since I was planning on wearing the jacket to my brother’s bachelor party, I nonetheless went along/was cool with them simply giving me a refund. I read their refund page around two days before the jacket was to arrive back at their warehouse/the refund was set to occur, which stipulated that ASOS does refunds through the card that was used for the purchase. I made the purchase through a Vanilla Visa gift card which was no longer in my possession/disposed of, seeing as its contents were rendered empty a month ago, and thus I told ASOS explicitly over chat NOT to send the funds back to that card account, as I would not be able to access it anymore. The person on the other line over chat agreed, and told me I would be contacted when they received the item back, and asked which account to properly send the money back to. Cut to the day of the refund... and they of course processed it to THAT GIFT CARD. UGHHH!!! I’m at a loss for words regarding this negligence/incompetence, so I reach back and demand to know how I could actually get my refund back. They say I need a receipt proving that I can’t access the funds, and Vanilla Visa says they can’t give me a bank statement without the full card information, which I no longer have because I NEVER THOUGHT I’D BE IN THIS MESS. The only thing I could do was drive two hours to the store I bought the gift card from and get a receipt/proof of purchase that way, just to show ASOS that it was indeed a gift card that they sent the money to. That apparently was not good enough for them, and they even refused to give me so much as mild compensation for my fool’s odyssey/any ASOS credit. F minus to the infinite degree for this site, lost two weeks worth of my paycheck in terms of funds, flushed down the drain somewhere in a gift card at the bottom of a Philadelphia garbage can. If anyone lives in the Center City area of Philly, good news: go dumpster diving, and you might luck out on ~$100 worth of free money. Actual trash company, ZERO OUT OF ONE BILLION."
"February 25, 2018",1,You're better off elsewhere,"My information was compromised with ASOS. Do not save any information. For some odd reason my account was hacked and an attempted over $1000 charge of orders popped up. ASOS did absolutely NOTHING - they did not even notify me I had noticed this myself and went out of my way to contact them. The process took over a week to get someone on the phone to talk about the situation - completely unacceptable. All they did was delete my account. I avoid ASOS completely now - I'm not really missing much, the quality is terrible. It's the quality of Forever21 but with the pricing of ZARA."

They don't offer exchanges so if you order something with a discount code, you better pray it all fits or be prepared to either get a refund and have to re-purchase the items at full price, or just return all your items and end up with nothing. Customer service is absolutely unhelpful, they don't make any effort to help. Don't support this company."

Only got two of the seven items (got the cheapest products). I already tried to send them a email and that chat on their website. No one can help me, and when they can’t answer my questions they just close the chat. So I paid 138£ for two pair of small plastic earrings. Worst service I ever had in my life!!!"
"February 22, 2018",1,Wouldn't shop here again,"Wouldn't shop here again. Their return policy is weird , it would be simpler if you returned an item and asked for an exchange. For example, I ordered a size 6 and they sent a size 10. In order for me to re order another size 6, I would have to return mine, wait 12 days for them to get the order and then REORDER a size 6  . Seems simpler if I had sent back my size 10 with a request to send back a size 6, but noooo. Won't shop here again"
"February 21, 2018",2,My order doesnt exist???,"I ordered something, didn't get a confirmation email, got charged, and when I went to my My Orders list in my account, there was nothing.  I then went to customer service, which was the WORST customer care experience of my life (after telling me she couldn't find my account even though I sent her a picture taken right after showing my order was accepted, with my order number and everything, ALENA told me to ""please kindly leave the chat"" when all I did was ask when I  was going to get my order as it was a gift and I don't have time for the 1 month delays they usually put me through)  Overall, a complete rip off.  Please, no one buy from this site, not only does it have THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE, they don't send their products almost everytime until you hunt them down and get delayed for a whole other month."

"February 21, 2018",2,"Horrible Customer Service, Order Issue Almost Every Time","It seems every time I order from ASOS I can count on their being an issue. To make it even worse, ASOS has the worst customer service of any online store I've ever dealt with. Their answer every time is basically 'we can't help you' or 'sorry we messed up, you have to jump through loopholes to fix our mistakes.' Most of the clothes fall apart, my skirt broke before I ever got to wear it and my dress broke as I was in line for security art the airport."
"February 21, 2018",1,Fraudulently takes your money,"Awful two orders in two days for two different suits, i ordered three pants in different sizes and each time they sent the jacket but were now out of stock for pants.

Delivery is next day for Premier customers (around £10 for a year's next day deliverable - unbelievable!) , the service is amazing and returns just as easy, and the one time the above 'incident' occurred, it was sorted super quickly via the help team. Well done ASOS, great job! :)"

I tried sorting out via chat and was told it was their mistake and asked for me to pick it up from my old workplace which is over 50 miles return journey.

Order date Jan 15th, ASOS confirmed the order the next day saying it had essentially ""left the warehouse"" and the expected delivery date was Jan 30th 2018. ASOS also indicates after the fact that once your order is placed, a local post office will provide a tracking number, noting that they do not provide any details and it is up to the post office(s). It is now Feb 19th 2018 with no order, no tracking number, no confirmation of where my package is. I have spent hours on the phone with numerous post offices, which provides to be challenging considering they need some form of a tracking number in order to physically track any package. Not only did I pay for my order, I was charged $70 in customs fee's and it has been over a month. The only thing I've recieved from ASOS is a confirmed order email, and a month's worth of headaches.I have contacted customer service 3 times with SHOCKINGLY zero help. Each time the person on the chat/email says to wait another week and then they can look into my order. I've waited until today (as told), and contacted once again, for ASOS to then tell me to wait until tomorrow end of day.... seriously!? Delaying a mere 24hrs? This is absolute BS!!!!I will NEVER shop with ASOS again, the customer service is non-existent and they have no phone number as they pride themselves on being an ""online web-based community"". Save yourselves the hassle of having to find a needle in a haystack... needle being your order. For being such a large UK based company they are absolute crap in delivering product.. literally!!!"
"February 19, 2018",5,Their service is flawless!,Its my third time purchasing from this company and all I can say is that their service is flawless!  I am also saving money because of the coupon offered on their site and those things are the reasons why I keep coming back!
"February 19, 2018",5,Totally awesome baby!,"My first time using ASOS and was outstanding. Website is perfect and informative, process and payments easy, delivery by DPD is spot on!Download the app and you can track you parcel! And the clothing quality was outstanding! Sizes totally correct, quality material and great weight!!Defo use again!!!!"

"February 17, 2018",1,terrible experience,"terrible experience!  I ordered a gift for Valentines day on 9th Feb and my asos account said it was despatched on the 12th feb, it never arrived and then when I enquired they said there was a problem with the package leaving the warehouse.  I spent 25 minutes on the live chat trying to resolve it but didn't.  I asked for a refund and they said they had refunded me the cost of the item but they would let me know within 24 hours if I'd receive a refund for the delivery!  This is preposterous as the item never even left the warehouse apparently but they had taken the money out of my bank account the day I ordered the item.  Absolute rubbish! never again. I asked for a number for complaints dept but they said they wouldn't advertise the number as its all dealt with through email and chat.  I still haven't received my refund.  NOT HAPPY"
"February 16, 2018",2,Disappointed,"I paid a lot of money to receive my order the next day, and received an email confirmation to say that my order had been dispatched and was on its way. Having previously contacted ASOS and been assured it was on its way, I waited until the end of the delivery period at 10pm to find that there was an error at the warehouse and so my order was not actually dispatched. And nothing ASOS could do to help me get my order by the next day in time for my engagement drinks. Very disappointing :("
"February 16, 2018",1,Asos has gone to sh’t,"I have spent a fortune with Asos over the years and always been so happy with the service and ease with which you can purchase/return items. Recently however the service has been appalling and I’ve had to have several arguments over email and live chat to try and get resolutions, none of which I’ve been happy with! I’m taking a loooooong break from Asos. Hopefully they’ll get themselves sorted and back to a model which puts the customer first."
"February 16, 2018",5,love asos have bought so many clothes…,love asos have bought so many clothes from here
"February 15, 2018",1,Not good enough,"Unfortunately I've not had a good experience with ASOS this time around. My order was delivered to the wrong address (ok, this isn't their fault) but it's been seriously hard work trying to either get a replacement or a refund. ASOS just keep sending me the same robotic response and after 2 weeks I'm still parcel-less and £130 poorer. Not good enough ASOS. Give me a refund or replace my order!!"
"February 15, 2018",5,My absolute favourite!,"I’ve never had any issues with ASOS. Great products, amazing customer service and free shipping. Student discounts with already great prices - it’s a good deal. Always my favourite online shopping experience."
"February 15, 2018",1,The worst customer service ever,The worst customer service ever. I've ordered on the 6th of February... on the 9th of February the tracking was mentioning that it was return to Asos without any reason. They can't tell me any reason and they don't know when I'll be refund. The chat customer service only replies with pre-written texts..
"February 15, 2018",1,Appalling customer services,"Appalling customer services. The bigger this company has got the worse their customer service has become. I have been pretty brand loyal from when the company first came around, but now after multiple issues, and their huge lack of customer service I am done. They claimed to have dispatched my item, send a tracking, only to reveal this wasn't the case once I chased up my order and its whereabouts. So why was any dispatch emails sent if the item actually didnt leave your damn warehouse. And would they have even bothered telling me if I hadnt chased it up. Their customer service is the worst Ive encountered in recent years. Their twitter help stops responding to DM's, their online chat advisors end conversations without letting you respond. I wont be shopping here again. Ever."
"February 15, 2018",5,Excellent products,"Excellent products, good prices and good customer service.The best app experience of any clothing company."
"February 15, 2018",1,AWFUL!,"AWFUL!Faulty items, wrong items, items didn't match the description and photos. not true to size, robbery refunds and the most terrible customer service: telling you they will do something - and they don't, promising a refund for the postal expenses (because it's you who need to send them back wrong items) and it's you who will waste time and nerves to actually get that refund, 3-4 different answers from the different people for the same question, once didn't answer for 5 days. The most incompetent company."
"February 15, 2018",5,super!,"incredible how fast they, send you your stuff :)"
"February 14, 2018",5,LOVE ASOS!,"Love this company! Really good range of products and I especially appreciate their tall range! Been buying from here for years and have always had a great experience ordering online and with refunds for returned items. Customer service is good and is always quick to resolve any issues should any occur. The whole process is so easy and stress-free! Another added bonus which makes them stand out is their A-List scheme which rewards customers with extra money off future orders.Definitely recommended, no idea why there are so many negative reviews!"
"February 14, 2018",5,"Fast delivery, true to size, good quality","I’ve ordered two dresses few days ago. The measuremnts are how the state in the description, true to size as I ordered a 4 and a 6 and they both fit me perfectly. The products are very cheap and high quality. The delivery was fast and arrived on time. One tiny issue, but it didn’t bothered me: for one of the dresses they stated that the colour is hot red, but it was far from this, it is a coral."
"February 13, 2018",5,True to size swimsuit tops,"I finally found a place to buy my swimsuits!! True to size, great fit, decent price, I will be back for sure!! It's always been difficult for me to find a swimsuit that is petite enough for my frame but large enough for my bust size. Really happy with the swimsuits I got, plus they shipped super fast!"
"February 13, 2018",1,My experience with Asos started off …,"My experience with Asos started off sub-par, then escalated into HORRIBLE. I ordered from them a few months ago, and ended up having to contact them because my order was a week late. Ended up being 2 weeks late total. Same thing happened to my friend about two months prior.But the ""horrible"" part, was when my sister ordered a dress for use as a bridesmaid at my wedding, and the dress had not shown up after almost 2 months. When she finally contacted them, it turns out the dress was out of stock... so they TOOK HER MONEY, then DIDN'T EVEN TELL HER ABOUT THE ISSUE!! They tried to get her to have it sent in a different colour (won't work, needs to be pink), then proceeded to try and get her to reorder a dress! Absolutely not! Finally, a refund was issued in the end. However, neither of us will be using Asos again. Poor, poor, POOR customer service."
"February 13, 2018",5,I have never written a review for any …,I have never written a review for any company before and I order most things online.  I have ordered from this company many times and I have NEVER had a problem.  The quality of the clothing is great and the size is spot on.  I've had to return some things before and have never had any problems before.  GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!!
"February 13, 2018",1,I paid extra for next day delivery,"I paid extra for next day delivery. After waiting in all day, I was told it might be delivered the following day instead. No real apology, just wasted money on my part!"
"February 13, 2018",5,Amazing!,Where do I start. So the ASOS website couldn't have been more simpler to use. You can even adjust your size pref such as shape of stomach etc which I haven't seen done before. Asos appreciates students and I saved £15 on my leather jacket. And wow the leather jacket i ordered was well worth my money. The quality is just perfection. I love ASOS and now will be my favourite choice for fashion!!!
"February 12, 2018",1,No adequate complaints process,No adequate complaints process. Customer service assistants refuse to escalate issues and do not engage with problems. ADR offered as next stage for which you have to agree to give a third party all of your personal data and permission to use it. They also look quite likely to be less than independent. Should be regulated. Seems to be a trend with lots of organisations these days trying to provide the bare minimum customer service and fob off customers.
"February 12, 2018",1,No order came but charged and told to reorder,"Second time in 3 weeks my order hasn’t came. First time it apparently went “missing”. Second order was sent, delayed, and apparently sent back to Asos, and after speaking to them (who weren’t very nice and quite cheeky) I was told the order would not be resent back to me when it was sent back to them, and if I still wanted the items I was to reorder them. And that was it. I tried to do that and now the items are out of stock, when I know they are lost in DPD circulation somewhere! Terrible service, terrible attitude from staff."
"February 12, 2018",5,Great website,"Great website, brilliant support. Always delivers on time and whenever there was an issue or I needed to return, they deal with it promptly and professionally."
"February 11, 2018",1,They do not ship to APO addresses …,"They do not ship to APO addresses PERIOD, do not even bother. I ordered two dresses for a military ball over a month ago. I talked to customer service via FB and they said they would send out two more dresses, one was out of stock so they said they would refund me, which they did. However, then I purchased a second dress to replace the out of stock one because I was hoping the shipping issues were resolved...guess what...NOTHING has shown up. Multiple orders, multiple FB conversations with ASOS, and absolutely nothing to show for it. I think it's terrible how they are ripping people off but also that they are falsely advertising that they ship to places they clearly do not. Either they need to change their carrier or stop advertising that they ship to APO's. Also, nothing from Amazon and Sephora or any other company I have used has not shown up, so I believe this is directly an issue with ASOS and their carriers."
"February 10, 2018",1,Took money from me twice,"Took money from me twice, sending order twice and the failing to deal with this appropriately leaving me out of pocket. Everyone I spoke to lied and toldMe something different. Even told me I couldn’t speak to anyone and no direct email address provided to make a complaint"
"February 10, 2018",1,ASOS WHAT A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE,"hi allplease first of all do not shop from this website i ordered shoes to gift it to someone they sent me the right box with the wrong shoe size in it i requested for refund and sent the item back to them spoke to customer chat helpline they confirmed they got the item and it will be done till 6 feb 2018.Guess what 6 more days are gone and no refund when i spoke to customer chat helpline again first he says we cannot track your item if you find any proof of postage with you please provide and we can do investigation .I told them last time your collegue promised that by 6 i will get refund after couple of minutes when I sent them the proof of postage which cearly showed they recieved the item then customer care replies now we will take 24 hours to investigate .Investigate what i dont know and 5 more days for refund .So please do not shop untill and unless you want headaches ,pathetic services,and stupid replies from customer helpline .If you want all those outstanding experiences mentioned above asos is the best place for you"
"February 09, 2018",2,WORST COMPANY EVER.,"WORST SERVICE. [EDIT BELOW]Items never received, no complaint pathway to follow except the chat service that never follows up. Items according to tracker were delivered to someone else with completely different name in completely different part of the country. . . NO REFUND, NO APOLOGY, LOST over $300EDIT: After a lot of bother and time wasted, I eventually got a refund."
"February 09, 2018",1,My delivery was stolen in the reception …,"My delivery was stolen in the reception of my apartment building despite the delivery service not ringing my doorbell and me being home the whole day. Livid. Contacted both the carrier service (that Asos hires) and Asos.Asos told me that they will look into it within 48 hours! Really that long! Not only that, but I bought these items for a vacation I was leaving for in three days. A long drawn out refund was not going to do me any favors. When a business messes up, you expect them to not only fix the problem, but also give you ""a hand shake"" a note of good will saying that you should continue to use the company. I didn't like the customer service. Very apologetic but not helpful or understanding."
"February 09, 2018",1,ASOS does not keep to Delivery Agreement,"I paid for premium delivery to receive the item before 10pm the following day.  The item was delivered to an unknown location - the photo taken by the driver is not of my street.  There is no phone number, so I went through 'chat'.  I was told that ASOS had to contact the courier before they can respond.  That will take between 3-5 working days.  I explained that ASOS had entered in to a contract with me for which I had paid to deliver the item before 10pm tonight.  It was only around 3pm when I contacted them. ASOS need to honour their agreement with the client. I asked for my call to be escalated to a manager, so I could still receive my item.  This will take 24 hours.  I said I would contact consumer helpline.  They terminated the chat."
"February 09, 2018",1,STEER CLEAR!,STEER CLEAR!Product was mediocre. Product came much later than guaranteed delivery date.Customs fee was ridiculous.Customer service was BRUTAL. Shop for maternity elsewhere!
"February 09, 2018",5,Fave place to shop,I’m surprised at the really bad reviews I’ve used them for years and love how easy it is to receive and return items. There’s been 2 occasions where they say they haven’t received my return but I simply send them a photo of my postage receipt and they refund me straight away. I’ve been using there £10 for a year next day delivery subscription and it’s amazing almost too good for the price! Great company with such a variety of clothes. Like with any catalogue type shop there are hits and misses with the things I order but it’s part of the fun. Who goes shopping and looks great in everything they try on? It’s the same thing when you order from any online store.
"February 08, 2018",1,Idiots,"Bought a dress for an event, and they sent the wrong one. I put in for a return/refund. Customer service says they will send me the dress again (after the event, so I don't need it). I say no, I asked for a refund. Cut to 3 different customer service people giving me different information about my refund. I finally send my return in and it gets delivered. 11 days after it arrives at the facility, no word. So I ask where my refund is. ""We haven't received the return yet"". Well actually, they sent me a tracking number that said it was delivered 11 days earlier!!!!!!! I tell them this and they FINALLY say they'll try and refund but if there are any issues they'll reach out. I hope that the refund clears, but I'm not feeling too confident. And I don't think they'll reach out with issues. I return has taken a month of ME reaching out to them! So insane, so many people saying different things."
"February 08, 2018",5,I read reviews after I placed my order …,"I read reviews after I placed my order and I was terrified that there would be problems. Not only did I get my package before it was expected(2 days to the US from UK? Crazy!) , but everything was delivered and exactly what I wanted."
"February 08, 2018",1,Dreadful Customer Care values!,"I waited all day for my parcel from ASOS.  I had paid a yearly special premium fee for items to be delivered the next day. It didn't arrive, even though I had received an email from them confirming it would arrive in the morning. The chat line was a waste of time. They don't seem to be able to help at all, just telling me it may take a week to arrive and just accept this.  Customer services refused to refund my delivery charge and to refund the dress I had ordered that was not delivered. I have been a good customer, this means nothing to them. I will never use them again. A very smug company with distorted customer care values. Avoid!!"

"February 06, 2018",1,Good luck trying to get the discounts promised!!,"First time using this website, thought I'd try them due to student discount. They made me enter personal and student email. I then had to validate the student email and then it said they'd sent me a code to my personal email. After all this messing about no discount code came through, so tried clicking the verification link again and then got an email saying they'd already sent it??? contacted them on chat and instead of a simple apology and re-send they wanted photo proof of my student card, even though I explained I'd already verified my email. Had to take picture, email it to myself, download it and then attach to give it to them. They then wanted the back of the card even though I explained it was blank?? Sent it to them begrudgingly and was told they would get back to me in 24 hours!!!!!!!! Argggghh! so annoyed wanted these clothes for tomorrow, will go use my NUS card in the shops instead!! Waste of space!"
"February 06, 2018",5,Excellent site - highly recommend them!,"My experience with ASOS has been mostly excellent! They always have great sales on, fantastic choice and always quick delivery! Customer service is good and free returns are easy and convenient. All in all very happy with this site!"
"February 06, 2018",1,This company claims to offer 2 day …,"This company claims to offer 2 day shipping.  However, I have tried this twice and paid the extra $12 only to not receive the items later than promised.  To make matters worse, even when they claim they will refund the shipping, they do not.  In fact, they refuse to speak to me about the order since my daughters email address was used to place the order instead of mine.  My daughter is a minor, we used my credit card to place the order, etc.  Just beware when trying to get something from this co in a certain timeframe."

"February 06, 2018",1,Very very bad  customer service,"Very very bad  customer service. I bought alot of products, and one was missing. When i decided to go and talk with them on chat, they were telling me that my order in not conected with the email i used on creating the asos account. I also proved with print screens that the order confirmation  was send on the specific email they said they can\t find. the bigger problem is that they are closing immediately the chat, therefore you are not able annymore to continue the discussion, so you have to take it all over again by starting a new chat and explaining 100 times same things. After 2 hours waisted my conclusion is, once you have something missing, you money are missing to. Good bye order good bye products"

"February 04, 2018",1,Delivery fail,"I do not understand how a company like ASOS still uses DPD as their delivery agent. DPD is the worse delivery company. If you want something to be delivered to you and DPD does the delivery, it is likely that you will not get your parcel as per you delivery arrangements. This happened to me again today. I stayed at home the whole day and received a notification stating 'was unable to deliver, there was no one to sign'.. I am so disappointed with ASOS telling me that I need to sort it out myself."

Confused, I contacted customer support. They told me to send the hat back via my postal service in order to exchange it (for the product I originally ordered!). They also said I would receive a confirmation email when the hat arrived back at their warehouse. I waited for nearly two weeks with no email, so I finally got on the customer support chat to express my frustration and concern. The representative asked me if I wanted a refund or replacement, to which I replied the latter. They assured me they would have it shipped within 24 hours, and would send me a confirmation email. They kept their word this time, and I received an email with the product info. This has been a headache, and I will not be ordering from this company again."

Unfortunately this did not happen, it has also caused  great inconvenience as i had to go to the shopping mall looking for outfit. This is loss of time and money incurred to travel just because your designated delivery company failed to deliver my item. I called on several occasions and unfortunately your advisers were not helpful. I have used asos for years and I'm highly disappointed in the level of service I had received  , even worse that your advisers were unable to turn the around the  horrible experience.At this stage I would like my full refund I including the refund of my premium delivery signed for.

In the US this is not required, and when i told them i would be notifying the bbb and opening a fraud report with my bank if they did not refund me for the items i didn't receive the rep responded ''no worries'' and ''go ahead''.

Too small so returned via Post ExpressPost and ordered next size which was perfect.  No refund of 126 Euro received for returned dress, despite confirmation from Post that it was delivered on 22nd March 2017 and repeated requests for a refund.  Dealt with 7 or 8 so called customer service people and sent about 15 e mails but still no joy.  It was paid for online via Paypal.  Post cant help any further other than confirm return and give postal tracking number.  The numerous customer service people stopped replying to my e-mails.  I assume they hope I will just drop the matter.  I have approached the consumer protection agency and hope the issue can be resolved in my favour.  I would not advise anyone to deal with this company. I have wasted so much time trying to get my refund without any success."

The DPD provided a photo to show that they have dropped the item somewhere in some other's rear porch (which we are not able to identify). We provided our rear porch photo and were told to wait two days first.And then, another two days... and then, were told to wait for 3-5 days so that DPD will investigate. Ten days passed, we were told that we still need to wait another 48 hours...We also got hung up twice rudely!!!!!  This is awful experience, we will NEVER buy items from them again.To us, the unpleasant experience is caused by ASOS although DPD may be blamed a little bit. It is ASOS's responsibility to fix it ASAP if items failed to deliver or to were delivered to an incorrect address.As a complaint, we have lodged the charge dispute.The ASOS customer supports that handle this case are:  Chloe and Clare."

After a month of chasing them because I still don’t have my goods, despite paying for next day delivery, they are refusing to offer me a refund because the DPD delivery driver says they handed it over to someone with my middle name at my address. I cannot stress how HORRENDOUS the customer service has been."

I like that they also use Klarna now so you can try before you buy. Delivery has been (mostly) quick and efficient. Never had any real trouble with them and they have a wide selection of clothing, shoes, accessories etc...would recommend."
"January 23, 2018",1,My Experience: ASOS will take your money and hold onto it until you ask for it back,"I placed an order on December 29th, ASOS took my money and gave me a delivery date of January 12th. I thought two weeks is pretty long but I decided to wait anyway. Jan 12th came and went and I heard nothing from ASOS. I contacted them and they told me there was a ""Technical difficulty"" with my order and I would have to reorder. By then, the item I had ordered was no longer available so I ordered something else that was in stock on January 14th. Again Asos took my money and gave me a delivery estimate of another two weeks. Again I waited. (Apparently I never learn)The delivery date again came and went. This time I received a refund notification from Paypal, but nothing from Asos until I contacted them.They told me that the item I ordered and paid for and received confirmation for was no longer in stock. I understand that stock can fluctuate but: a) why leave it up to the customer who has already paid to contact you before you notify them? That's unacceptable/b) why take the money and keep it on your books without knowing you will be able to fulfil the order? Holding customers' money for orders you cannot fulfil is unethical at best as well as being legally questionable."

This company is my go-to for pretty much everything and so handy when buying last minute gifts! Asos have even started using Klarna (buy now pay later) which has saved me so many times from waiting for payday to come around. With next day delivery, fast refunds and awesome customer service you can’t go wrong! Asos = Gift from the heavens!Keep it up guys 👍🏼"
"January 23, 2018",1,I’ll put the whole picture for you,"I’ll put the whole picture for you, Asos: Customer service = Useless Delivery Service = Hopeless I’m so appalled by how minimal the efforts the customer service provide us with the help. It’s almost like they copied and pasted from a manual book. My situation is, i ordered a wallet for my friend’s birthday and opted for free delivery because i spent $105SGD (01/16)i don’t feel like paying extra for express shipping  (cost $45SGD) since the birthday is on the 28th January anyway. Everyday i would check on the tracking website on the item’s whereabouts, but they stopped updating since the 18th. I contacted the costumer service she told me i should be expecting my order on the 23rd and to check the website regularly. This freaking morning (01/23) i woke up at my girlfriend’s house i checked my damn phone the status says they made a delivery yesterday (01/22) at 6AM so now my order is returned to sender. So i spoke to the customer service “Rory”, wasted my 30 minutes, only to uselessly told me to re-order and wait for my refund because there was nothing he could do.  So i kept calm saying “Reordering is basic. What i would like is a solution from a customer service. And technically it’s the courier fault for not updating the tracking site, should they updated out for delivery i would be ready since i’m always home”. But the reply was very dismissive he replied “I am simply stating your problem..” Lol. I know the problem why would you repeat the problem to me? so funny he admits that he can’t solve any problem. Then what’s the point of customer service? Anyway asked the refund duration, he tried to play with words saying 21 days and it takes 5-10 days to be back into your account. So i bluntly do the math on him “21 days + 5 to 10 days = 1 MONTH” and his response screamed negligence and ignorance he replied “yes that time frame”. In conclusion, i need to wait for 30 days to get my refund and reorder if i still am interested with the item and spend another $105. So if the next item has similar problem, i guess i get my money back in March. Since they probably thought i am as rich as Pablo Escobar anyway.. Ehh what’s another $105 until next next month? right? Wasted my 30 minutes. Asos has both terrible customer service + delivery service = Poop."

They sent it to the wrong email 5 times and it took until mid january to get the voucher, only for me to go to use it and getting an error to say the voucher had been cancelled. Attempted to resolve this with an online adviser and was told to wait 48 hours for someone to respond. Still waiting to see if this will be resolved. More than anything you can just tell they don't care at all."
"January 22, 2018",1,Worst company I have ever ordered from,"Worst company I have ever ordered from. Product was incorrectly described online, contact customer services. They told me to wait for the team to look into and not to return. I then contacted ASOS over  times in the space of a month and was then told just to return for a refund. Delayed me getting a refund for no reason. Shocking service from a rubbish company. Will never use again"

Contacted them on the 11th working day were I was told that they haven't received my parcel therefore can't give me a refund (which infuriated me). I then went on Asos chat where I was told that no refund request was ever put in prior to me going on chat, five days after going on chat and having a heated verbal conversation with someone from the customer service team who decided to argue with me that 9th Jan was the 10th working day from the original refund date and I had to wait. I received my refund. Prior to that order I hadnt shopped with them since 2016 I now remember why.Worse customer service I have encountered with an online retailer and my experience isnt one of few it's one of many all you have to do is ask 5 people and I promise you 1 has had an issue with this company."
"January 20, 2018",1,Absolutely disgusted! Avoid at all costs.,"Absolutely disgusted! Been an Asos customer since I was 16 (now 24) and I will NEVER order from them again. Was told my order was coming on the 17/01/18. It is now the 20/01/18 and using the Hermes tracker it tells me they have 5 failed delivery attempts. I have been home EVERY TIME they claimed they tried to deliver and no one came to my apartment. I have a concierge who is open until 8pm and during the times they claimed to have tried to deliver either myself or the concierge were open and NO ONE came. After speaking to the most useless live chat staff in history, I was given the link to live chat to Hermes. They were equally as useless. I emailed customer care and they said the same f***ing thing: ""I can see your parcel is being delivered today"". It ISN'T! I even made sure both Hermes and ASOS had my correct address and both confirmed the right one. So I know for a fact the driver just can't be bothered to come to my address. Customer service is an absolute joke. Asos is only good if you don't have a problem, otherwise they don't give a damn about their customers!"

After 3 weeks they finally 'resolved' the issue by being informed it was delivered to the wrong address like I had said the whole time. They refunded my money and when I contacted them again saying 2 of the 3 items are now out of stock they told me to 'check back' every few days to see if the items are available again. Completely terrible customer service. Extremely unsatisfied. Been using asos for yrs but now I would never recommend them again.

No minimum spend for this either.They've got an amazing range of brands and products. Really good sales and even stock beauty goods now and stuff for the home, so this is super handy. Love that they now use klarna which means you can order clothes without paying for 30 days and if they don't fit, just return them - no faffing around waiting for refunds etc. Really good idea! I like the a list rewards as well, although there should be more double points days as I haven't come across one yet but aside from that I love asos. Their own brand products are always good value and a good fit. Defo recommend."

I messaged the team via messenger, it took them some time to respond to this, then the asos member said they would have this looked into.... still no response, passed from member to member. Finally, the voucher is now out of date (after 2 weeks of being promised this would be resolved) then they no longer want to speak to me even though they said it would be resolved. They are really quite rude too. I email customer service, explain everything....yet receive an email apology and get told I will be contacted to resolve this. 3 Weeks later...NOTHING. Email again....get told the same thing...and a month on.. still no email from this 'team' who is looking to my problem.Time wasters."

Once I informed them of this there was still no explanation for the signed for item they assured me had been delivered there’s more but I can’t be bothered very very disappointed at the lack of customer service.

That is another reason I keep coming back. The only thing I can say I do not like is that when an item goes out of stock, there is no way to track the item if/when it will become available again."
"January 18, 2018",2,Great - as long as you don’t have an issue,"A few weeks ago I would have been the first to sing the praises of ASOS. I’d never had an issue with them. However I recently made a purchase using an A list voucher and a gift card I got for Christmas. The order was unsuccessful, but they still took my gift cards. When I first raised this query, I was told they would be automatically refunded in 24-48 hours - annoying but fair enough if that’s the process. Four days went by and nothing. I tried to contact them via chat who were absolutely useless. I also messaged them on Facebook and they took over a day to respond any time I sent a message. By the time I finally got through to somebody who could help, I was told I would then have to wait for the gift cards to be refunded which then took another week. All this took nearly three weeks and the items I wanted were out of stock! Pretty poor for an issue that was their fault. Customer service was horrific and apart from to use my gift cards, I will not be using them again."

Ordered a watch and received a grey t shirt- labelled as the watch with the correct barcode etc. I found it very difficult to find where to contact- no phone number just an online chat or email. They said the email service was taking a while so I did the chat. Spewed out generic and unhelpful responses and said they'd email me about it in 5 days. They then told me the watch was now out of stock but to get a refund I'd have to return the t shirt, which I was happy to do but I wanted my money back first. As it was immediately out of stock I felt this was purposeful because they had oversold an item, I feel like I have been deceived by them. I then had to go out of my way to return the incorrect item and haven't heard anything in a week. All I remember from the last time I did a return is it took a month- which is ridiculous anyway. But I shouldn't have had to do it in the first place. I'm truly upset by ASOS on this occasion and most definitely won't be using them again."

My first contact via online help chat wasnt particularly helpful and 'insisted' I should be checking with all my neighbours to see if they had it. 2nd attempt was 'answered'  but the rep then proceeded to ignore me for 15 minutes with no response. After my 3rd contact with them they did actually mention the word refund and offered to arrange a replacement, hurray, has some what soured my opinion of what I thought looked an excellent retailer"

I contacted customer service and they had another pair sent out for me then and there. Fantastic customer service, they always go above and beyond!"
"January 17, 2018",1,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE,"This is hands down the most frustrating experience that I have had dealing with a customer service team. I made an order using my personal Mastercard, which shortly after I closed and started using a different account joined with my husband.  I contacted ASOS after making a return to let them know if the new card details.  I had to jump through minor hoops like showing that the first account was actually closed, which was expected.  We are now here over 1 month later and still no refund!! There is no way to get anyone on the phone and everytime an email is answered it is by a different person who obviously has no clue was they are talking about.  Someone claims to have called me but no missed call or voicemail - bit suspicious! They are fighting me tooth and nail, claiming that I have already received the refund and asking for more and more evidence when I have provided them copies of bank statements three times already.Best part is they have even addressed me as an incorrect name in an email! They called me the name of one of their colleagues, twice....so the care factor is obviously minimal and they are holding my money hostage. Don't even both ordering from here because you always end up making a return due to poor quality and as I've learned you aren't very likely to get your actual money back!"
"January 17, 2018",1,Very unprofessional,"They suck. No one answers the messages. I have a next day delivery with them which I paid for and also a confirmation from them that my package will arrive on the 17.01.18 between 07.00& 22.00 only to receive tracking info from Hermes that my package will infect arrive on the 18th apparently ASOS has changed their delivery service from UPS who delivered my packages promptly on time, religiously. Hermes charges 20c landline and up to 60c mobile to talk to and not helpful at all but of course they don’t mind keeping you online. ASOS won’t answer my emails, chat requests or messenger messages. Very unprofessional. It’s 03.15 and I’m still waiting for a response as I need to fly with the parcel tonight. I of course have had prior problems wich always need far too many hours communication before anything can be done if at all."

I ordered a jacket on the 27th of December and it was delivered to me a few days late - not a huge deal. However, upon opening the package, I quickly discovered that this jacket was SIGNIFICANTLY different than it appeared in the photos and description on the ASOS website. After waiting patiently and excitedly for this item to finally be delivered to me, I was very, very let down by the completely different item that I had received. Despicable way to run a clothing website. Be very cautious, and order at your own risk."
"January 16, 2018",5,"Fab company, one of the best!","I have ordered a few times from this company now and have to say I'm highly impressed. Ordered Saturday night, package one arrived yesterday (Monday) and other package came today (Tuesday) very quick! Packaging nice and easy to open, unlike some companies packaging. All items clean and packaged nicely. Have also returned stuff in the past from these guys, easy return process and got money back within the week....  what's not to like?!

"January 16, 2018",1,"Wrong items delivered, awful support","Ordered a 3 piece suit, paid for next day premium delivery. Got delivered a pair of white trainers instead.So I have contacted their customer support, and they apologised and said they will order redelivery for me, which will take up to 5 working days to be confirmed.I said ""wait a minute, I have paid for next day delivery"" and they replied ""yes, once the redelivery is confirmed within 5 days then we will post with next day delivery"" as if that was ok! Seriously?!So I went ahead to cancel my order and get the delivery cost refunded too. Now I have to run to the post office, post the parcel, once they get it they said it takes them 8 days to confirm the refund. It takes another 5 days for the refund to come through. So I am £230 out of pocket for 2 weeks because of their mistake!AVOID AT ALL COST!"
"January 16, 2018",3,Policy when you want to change an order,I ordered the wrong size by mistake but I have noticed it before the order was processed. I sent a message asking them to change the size since there is no price difference and the order was not even processes. They couldn’t due to security reasons thats what customer support said. They also said wait for the item to come and then return it and then you will get a refund and re order. I am from Cyprus and this is can take up to two weeks when they could just have changed the size! Frustrating!
"January 15, 2018",1,"Awful packaging, dirty items","Their packaging is awful and they do not protect the items which ends up in them being damaged when you receive them. Then you have to go through a refund process which takes a month while they keep your money. It is unacceptable and honestly, the packaging is not that difficult.

Did not fit correctly, so returned and went to order another size, contacted ASOS to request that I could use the voucher again, seeing as I was purchasing the exact same jacket. Was told basically that it was my own fault for purchasing the wrong size. Great products, speedily delivery, but very poor customer service!"
"January 15, 2018",1,"Great products, yet the worst customer service","I've been shopping there for years. I love the products and think they are great quality for the price. Beats H&M or Primark by a landslide. However, the customer service has always been terrible. I wouldn't recommend shopping with ASOS unless you must. As a plus sized girl, there's really nothing of similar price and style out there so I haven't got much choice but to kope with their bullcrap 9 out of 10 times I order. People aren't exaggerating. They need to rebuild their customer service from scratch."

Received message from DPD saying parcel was delivered and signed for - not sure how as we were at work. Have chased ASOS via live chat 8 times now and been fobbed off on every single occasion. Got fed up with their lies and chased DPD who investigated delivery and said looking back they have no match for the signature!!! over the last 6 months and sat nav can place the driver at our address (which is what you would expect if he was delivering). DPD have now closed the case and i have to claim through ASOS. Now gone back to ASOS who have to contact DPD and so the circle continues..................RUBBISH, RUBBISH, RUBBISH service"
"January 14, 2018",1,DO NOT EVER USE THIS COMPANY,"DO NOT EVER USE THIS COMPANY. I ordered my item and was told I'd have it by Janaury 11. During that time, I received almost a dozen emails from UPS i-parcel that did not specify a location of my items. Needless to say, January 11 came and went. I chatted with a rep online on January 13 who literally said ""Sorry hiccups happen sometimes."" She told me that I'd have my item by January 18, so I asked when that date was ever communicated to me as a customer. She completely avoided the question and told me she advised all she could/would be closing the chat. I reached out to another rep about the company being deceitful and this rep now said I'd get my item by Janaury 22. It's funny how ASOS is quick to take your money, but is deceptive about delivery times/locations."

It's basically a very annoying game of ping pong at the expense of the paying customer. With asos being such a big company, you would expect them to invest in a high standard of customer service. That is not the case and it's very disappointing when you spend ages trying to communicate an issue when you shouldn't have to."
"January 13, 2018",1,Disgusting customer service!! DONT BOTHER!!!,"What big company in this day and age, doesn’t have a customer care centre u can actually speak to, and then a complaints process, but na, not ASOS! Their customer service is disgusting! Only way u can speak to them is either an online chat, emails or Facebook messenger chat. And they’re far from helpful! I ordered a parka and got some stupid hippie tshirt with the picture of a dopehead in the post instead, seemed like they pulled a prank on me!! They won’t acknowlege the complaint, aren’t bothered and simply say, send it back and we will refund u, end of! Appalling service. Won’t be shopping here again!"

A few things have been delayed or overdue but the customer care team themselves have been great!It did take them longer than normal to reply to my email over the Christmas period but this is advertised on their page as they are receiving high volumes of emails. I have returned a few parcels and they have not been refunded within the set 7 days, which is a little but of a pain but given the Christmas period I understand it may take a little longer. I have had 2 webchats with the team on 4/1 and then again today on 12/1 and each time they've been nothing but friendly and super helpful. They have asked for my proof of postage and tracking number, apologised that there has been a delay and sent confirmation of the return to be refunded to my bank. I get that it is frustrating when things go wrong, but as for the team themselves and the customer care they offer, they've always been fantastic and couldn't ask for more!!"

"January 12, 2018",2,ASOS has gone severely downhill,"When I first started shopping at ASOS years and years ago, it was great! Clothes were beautiful, made well, fit well, but sadly that is all now a thing of the past because their quality has declined so much over the years. I knew it was time to stop shopping with them when FOUR of my orders in a row had to be returned either because they were ill fitting, bad quality, or not at all like they were shown as on the website. They've become laughable now and have gone from a reputable site for fashion to literally a Forever 21 knock off. Plus, everything seems to go out of stock extremely quickly and they never restock anything."

"January 10, 2018",1,Worst company to deal with.,"Worst company to deal with.Paid for asos premier delivery and item does not get delivered even after two days.Excuses from customer services is that ""It is out of our control regarding deliveries"" but we charge you £ 9.99 next day delivery which is always to our poor expectations. Also we do not care for our customers is our motto.""Contact us after two days and we will try to sort it out"" Customer service also not very helpful, worst customer services I have ever seen.I think asos management have to change. This is  frequently happening. You guys have to sort yourselves out. Change your delivery companies. At least asos could compensate or give a discount code for their customers. Managers need do a proper course in managing employees and with  proper training this would never had happened.Take some training skills and management courses from Amazon. Never had issues with them and if item was not delivered next day than I was always given a discount voucher for next delivery."

"January 10, 2018",1,terrible customer service,I have been using ASOS for many years with no issues but recently had a parcel stolen. DPD delivery driver left my package on my front porch and said I had signed for it. Reported this to ASOS but they have not refunded me or sent me another item. They have asked DPD to launch an investigation which was over a month ago with no end in sight.
"January 10, 2018",1,Absolutely shocking experience with …,Absolutely shocking experience with ASOS. First and last time I will be using the website. I ordered a skirt for an event well in advance (roughly 3 weeks) to give myself enough time incase it didn't fit to find something else to wear. Firstly my package was 4 days late to deliver taking nearly 2 weeks to arrive. I was so excited to receive my package but to my disappointment I received a pair of pyjamas NOT A SKIRT. I immediately emailed ASOS customer care team on the 19th of December and kindly explained the issue. After getting no response I sent the package back 2 days later and requested a refund. I didn't receive an email back until the 9th of January so it took them 3 weeks to respond to an email. I'm am absolutely shocked by the appalling customer service for such a well known website. I am still awaiting a refund which will probably never happen. Shocking experience....do not use this website!!
"January 10, 2018",1,Spend your money elsewhere if you want to receive what you ordered,"Ordered some Replay jeans in the sale, waited almost a week for them to arrive & when I opened the package it was a totally different pair of (awful) jeans. Contacted the ASOS customer service via their online chat as they don't take phone calls & was told my only options were to wait to see if they get the correct jeans back in stock or send it back & wait for another 2 weeks or more to get a refund after I send the incorrect one's back... by which time I won't be able to get anything in the sale elsewhere. This is the second time this has happened to me with ASOS despite the fact I have only ordered from them a few times. The last time this happened was a couple of years back & I thought I would give them a chance again given the time that has passed, but it seems that they will still just shove anything in a bag & send it to you if their warehouse don't find the item you have actually ordered. It seems it is too much trouble for them to contact you to say they can't supply your order & give you an option of a refund at that time"
"January 10, 2018",1,Clothing measurements were for clowns,Clothing did not fit like it was portrayed. I ordered 2 separate orders back to back and one showed up a week later than the other. I’m not even going to attempt to send the items back. Well it looks like I have some motivation to lose some pounds this 2018! Since this jacket is bomb AF and it was $300! Get your act right ASOS! Lol

Great website, very easy to use, make purchases and check out. Super fast delivery and a great deal with their subscription which includes free next day delivery for a year. Only one point on an issue with the site is that items drop out of your basket after an hour. A few times I have spent a couple of hours shopping online, looking through thousands of items, comparing them, checking sizes etc, by the time I'm ready to check out half the basket is missing as I can't remember what I've lost. I have given up a few times when I'd been about to spend several hundred pounds."

"January 09, 2018",1,Horrible customer service,"Was told delivery date of product would be on or before Dec 20. January 6, still didn't arrive. Talked to a customer service rep. She said it got ""lost"" and would send another right away, express delivery. Ok, all good. Then got told it wouldn't arrive until January 27. I checked on their webiste and saw express should arrive by January 11, so I called to ask. This is the time I got upset. They said if it is express delivery, I would have to pay customs fees. Why did that not come up the first time? Then, they said that I had to go through their ""checks"" to verify that I did not recieve the product. Why would I have to do that when I was told it got lost? Nope, their answer was - I had to go through these checks before the order gets processed. It is like they did not want to re-send even though they had already confirmed that it got lost. I will never buy from them again."

"January 07, 2018",1,Beware of ASOS - unprofessional and disgraceful company!!,"First of all the service is hideous!! I was supposed to get my package in what they call express delivery and was extra charged for that by the local customs, but it's been more than two weeks and I'm still waiting for it. Asked the support to refund me for the ""express delivery"" charges (15 pounds should be peanuts for them..), but it's like talking to a wall.The support agents barely know English and the answers they provide are totally out of context.Beware of this seller and watch the delivery method you are offered (I have applied a discount code and the delivery method changed to express so it could be a scam and not a real discount). Real disappointment, would expect more dedication from such a big company."
"January 06, 2018",1,I would rate ASOS zero stars if I …,"I would rate ASOS zero stars if I could. I ordered some trainers that were on sale on the 25th December. I received my order on the 3rd January as stated. However, on receiving my order I found that they had sent me the wrong trainers. The trainer box was for the pair that I ordered but there was a different pair in the box.I contacted ASOS who made no effort to supply me with the product that I had ordered. Their response was that the item was out of stock and that they could not order more stock in. They are processing a refund for me but due to their incompetence I have missed out on a good deal and I am out of pocket ordering the same trainers from another website. I will not be ordering from them again! Becareful that you get the product that you paid for!!!"
"January 06, 2018",1,Customer service is appalling,"I ordered a shirt and cardigan from ASOS, I received an email to let me know that the order had been despatched, then the next thing I know I'm receiving an email to say the courier missed me as I wasn't in. However there were 4 people in on the day they claim to have attempted delivery, including someone in the front room right next to the door! Further evidence that they didn't even attempt to deliver my parcel, no calling card was left to say they had been and missed us. Instead of ""reattempting"" they returned my parcel to ASOS. Now ASOS will not offer me anything despite the fact no one tried to deliver my order, and now one of the items in my order is out of stock. So I am left without my order for absolutely no reason. DO NOT TRUST THIS RETAILER!"
"January 06, 2018",1,ASOS 'Grinched' my Christmas!,"My wife ordered a pair of boots for my Christmas present. She got the order confirmation emails and dispatch confirmation notification with a tracking number. It was getting close to Christmas but we were within the pre Christmas delivery deadline.To make things easier, I suggested that she use Collect Plus. That way we could collect the parcel at our convenience instead of having to wait in for it.She never received a notification about the item being delivered to the Collect Plus collection point so she called ASOS. They assured her that the item had been despatched and put her on to Collect Plus but they claimed that the parcel had never entered their system. This would explain why there was no tracking updates although ASOS later claimed that the parcel had been sent using a non-trackable service?On Dec 27th my wife received an email telling her that her returned item had been received by ASOS.Another call to ASOS customer services and a conversation with some hapless mug who was only authorised to say ""I'm really sorry"".He did offer a 10% off voucher (I get an email practically every morning offering me 10%off).In short, I feel royally screwed over by ASOS and if I saw their CEO crossing the street, I wouldn't even brake."

"January 03, 2018",1,Crap. Asos scam. Penalised for returning items.,They deactivated my account for returning items for no reason. I returned my orders roughly 5 times in a 2 year period because it didn’t fit and I didn’t like it. So it’s against their policy to return clothes now because you’ll be banned?  I messaged them and they’re telling me it’s because “I made a much higher than average number of returns”. It’s not my fault the clothings are trash. No wonder why their sales have taken an 87% plunge. Hopefully they’ll go into administration and Asos will no longer exist soon.Will shop elsewhere. Bye Felecia.

For starters they don't stretch at all.  I couldn't even get my foot in.  The inside was all coming loose.  I waited a week and a half for them to be delivered.  I won't shop here again or recommend asos to anyone.  I also did not recieve any notifications during the process of my order.  Nothing to say it was placed successfully or to say when it would be delivered.   There was an advertisement on the website which stated that if the order was made by a certain date then it woukd arrive before the new year.  This obviously did not happen.  I did get a text message to say that my parcel was with the delivery driver.  10 minutes after it had been delivered.I expected more asos.

In my most recent chat i found out that my order has been lost, so now i have to wait ANOTHER 4 days to receive an email about replacement order, which will take another 3-5 days to be delivered. I think this is a joke, and the 'help' team provide no help but only make excuses.Update... i got the email about a replacement order, and because they lost my first order, 2 of the items (the ones i wanted the most) are now out of stock so cannot be resent in my replacement order."

"mber 30, 2017",1,Company gone downhill... Not worth it for Canadian customers,"I have been purchasing from ASOS for years now. I always liked their selection of products and they (used) to have pretty decent quality. But the last few times I have ordered (why I keep ordering I dont know..) have been bad experiences. Firstly, as a Canadian customer it's just not worth it to buy from them. You have to pay for returns which are extremely expensive so it better be worth it. Furthermore, if you order items over 80$ you usually get nabbed for duty and it's BAD. But more than that each time I have ordered in the last 6 months I have not gotten my order for almost a month. The site will tell me the date by which I should definitely recieve my items by and they just dont come until well after. Currently, I am waiting on an item that I had ordered to come by Christmas (and the site told me it would) and it still isnt here a week later (its been over a month now). I contacted customer service and they are no help at all. Each time I have contacted them in the past about missing parcels they just keep giving me another week to wait and offer no recourse. The other thing I dont agree with is that they do not give Canadian customers tracking numbers. This means they/you have no idea where they parcel is. The CS rep told me to call around to various post offices so I'm basically on a wild goose chase for my item. Further than this I have experienced many site glitches where I order an item, order goes through, then I recieve an email a day later saying the item is out of stock. Another time their site glitched and an order went through 2x and I couldnt cancel the order within the hour time frame because the site was down. They told me I'd have to wait for the item to arrive then return it... major hassel for me and that means I have to wait until the item arrived, pay for shipping back, then wait another 1-2 weeks for the item to get there and them to process the refund.  After many purchases I will not be buying from them again."

Absolutely appalled, will not be shopping there anymore."

I order almost weekly from there and my stuff is always delivered on time and promptly with DPD.Once or twice I've had a couple of issues with item quality - I received a pair of boots with frayed laces which snapped as soon as I tried the boots on so reached out to their customer care team. It took a day for them to reply (understandable during their busiest time of the year) but a replacement was arranged very quickly which arrived promptly too. They have a pretty good loyalty scheme too.I've only ever had one order late, by just one day due to a DPD mis-sort and everything else has always arrived on time. Returns are quick to process and never had any issues. Thanks ASOS!"

"mber 27, 2017",3,My experience with returns & refunds,"Usually I do some shopping in ASOS online website. The clothes that come are generally really good. But this last time, I ordered a Jumpsuit and it was absolutely different from the picture and didnt fitted well! So, 6th of November I returned it back with Aramex Courier. From the info I got from asos I will get my refund only after ONE MONTH!!!(WTH&&&!!!???) But okay, so I decided to wait. I went for vacation for a month, and when I came back on 23th!!!! of DECEMBER (LOL) and verified my paypal balance. Of course no money was refund to me.So I contacted the asos customer service, and they informed me the package hasnt been received and they will verify again and that will take more 15-20 days. SO ASOS!!! WTH IS THIS? When it comes to take the customer money it is detucted right away, but if the customer is not satisfied with the LOW QUALITY items he receives.... then you really dont care to give a refund and you try to delay it as much as you can. what kind of policy is this? After this experience.. I dont think so I will order from ASOS ever again."

"mber 25, 2017",3,Restocking dresses,Asos really needs to start restocking dresses more quickly. Honestly just get enough size 6 because thats what most people wear. I'm always about to order a dress and then see that my size is out of stock. I look everyday to see if its back in stock and It never is. They need to do a better job at this.
"mber 24, 2017",5,I've only ordered with them over the …,"I've only ordered with them over the past few few months. I've made a total of 4 orders since I discovered them. I've had nothing but good experiences using their UK and USA websites. I've gotten tall women jeans & leggings, and the cutest jewelry box. I even paid $20 for their 2 day shipping for a year deal. I've never had any issues because I make sure to enter my information correctly and use PayPal with every purchase. I love shopping with them!"
"mber 24, 2017",1,No re-delivery as mentioned. Make sure you put the right shipping address,"I live in Singapore. I input an incorrect shipping address for my order. This is my fault for not thoroughly checking through whether ASOS was able to deliver to POPStation (a self-collection method).I immediately contacted ASOS customer care one day after asking if I can change the address. The customer care assistant told me after delivery fails I can change my address. I was relieved.I tracked my parcel daily eagerly awaiting it. On the 4th day past estimated delivery date, my parcel status suddenly changed from ""In Delivery"" to ""Return to Sender"". I was alarmed and immediately contacted ASOS. They told me delivery to my address failed and thus, a full refund was to be processed. I was puzzled. I did not receive any email or message for a re-delivery and certainly did not want to refund my items. They did not tell me anything, just sending my parcel back without even informing me. On the ASOS website, it even showed my parcel is still in deliveryThe customer care told me to re-order. Items would take 21 days to return to their warehouse and a further 5-10 days for the money to be refunded. What's worse was that I ordered during a sale and re-ordering would lose that huge savings I would get. Even worse was that one item was the last in size and the customer care could not even guarantee me reserving that size.Overall, immensely disappointed with ASOS. They have a huge catalogue and good prices. However, international delivery is full of problems and customer care do not have much power to help you. Compared with Lazada whereby the customer care could easily coordinate with courier, ASOS really needs to work on its service. I may buy again because their catalogue is really huge but not after checking out other sites first."

Speak to Anthony the chat advisor who is the nastiest piece of work, jobs worth I have ever had the displeasure of speaking to and clearly has no empathy or business working in customer service. All I received was copied and pasted useless info and was blatantly ignored. Now I am not getting through to anyone and am £60 out of pocket and without my present, Christmas is ruined and Asos are not interested in helping me. Anthonys bright idea was returning the earrings for a refund which is genius considering my issue is that the earrings haven't actually turned up in the first place but I will be happy to send Anthony a pair of non existent, imaginary, invisible earrings in the post and hopefully they will actually reach him! don't order from Asos."

I have finally been informed their ""global delivery team is on holidays until 27th"".  So great, I don't get my parcel until next week and therefore my son will be waking up on Christmas morning with no presents.

"mber 21, 2017",5,Cannont fault for extremely quick delivery,"Thought I'd best write a wee review. Found Asos after looking for a jumper. Anyway, read all the real bad reviews on Trust Pilot and thought, ""aye right they must be s@@@@."" Because of this I initially said to myself that no way would I buy from there, but as it happens I changed my mind and gave them the benefit of the doubt. I'm up here in Edinbutgh by the way. Ordered the jumper yesterday 20th December, and I received a confirmation email saying everything was cool and that the estimated delivery date would be Saturday 23rd December, making it three days after delivery. After reading the reviews I took the estimated delivery date with a massive pinch of salt. . . I received an email this afternoon, 21st December saying that my jumper had been delivered to my chosen location. Again I thought, ""nah no way"" and once again took his with a massive pinch of salt. Anyway I scurried down to Sainsburys to get my parcel. The woman scanned my code and it had a woman's name on it. Hmm not good. She asked me if it was from Asos and I said yeah; she told me they'd been putting the wrong names on people's goods. Here is where I thought the f@@@ up would hit home. So, just when I was leaving the Sainsburys I looked inside the parcel and lo and behold there was the jumper I'd ordered roughly only 24 hours earlier. Woo hooo....Now I can't comment on other folks orders and how wrong things seemed to go but my impression ordering from Asos I cannot fault, I may have just been incredibly lucky. This was the first time using this company and I will definitely use them again but I will once more take everything with a pinch of salt until my goods are in my hands. But for this first occasion, many thanks...And the jumper is great... a very satisfied customer indeed..."

A $75 dollar sweater became $150 after all taxes and $15 express shipping. It's probably $5 value item. Customer service ASOS is just beyond the worst ever! 1. there is no person to talk to but you can use messenger (Are you for real?) 2. their answers are just mean, unpersonalized and somewhat rude. 3. they thank themselves for resolving the problem in the very first reply!!!  I will never use them or recommend to anyone!!!!"
"mber 21, 2017",1,"Incorrect items receive on multiple occasions, terribile apathetic customemer service","I placed my first order with asos, for 4 jumpers on 14/12When my parcel arrived, once of the jumpers was the wrong size. I checked my delivery note to see if I had made a mistake, the delivery note was correct but asos had sent me the wrong size.No telephone number to call, so had to use facebook messenger. I received a reply the next day to apologise and advise gthe correct item had been dispatched.I received the second parcel today, lo and behold it is incorrect again. Despite clearly stating the item title and product code, asos sent me the wrong item this time.Once again I used the frustrating customer service online system, this time with live chat. I understand that asos will be busy at this time of year, but the response I receive was truly dreadful.Frankie said that it would be 48 hours before this could be 'looked into', which quicky changed to 72 hours. when I asked why this was different to the advice received on messenger, I received no reply. I was told that this would not even be looked at until after xmas. I asked for the complaints process details, Frankie became very awkward and that the online chat was the complaints process (not true) and she would ask her supervisor to call me in 48 hours. This sounds very strange, untrue and completely unhelpful.I googled Resolva and instantly obtained their postal address and telephone number! FYI this is 02077561000. Called and got through to a friendly chap, who ultimately couldn't help me. Asked me to go online, but the correct item again (it is in stock) and return the incorrect items. He did promise to refund my next day delivery charge by 'keepinig an eye on my accout' for the next hour. Trusting his promise, I did what was agreed. No refund of the delivery charge eve came through. I also have no clue if I will get the correct item - on my third attempt.All contacts at asos were made aware this is my first ever order and that these are needed for xmas. This made no difference to their apathy. My first and last ever purchase due to the truly horrific customer service."

Also I have worn these boots which are over the knee which I was excited to wear. These appear perfect on a model but when I wore them with a pair of thick tights.. Well on my way out they were falling down past my knee.. wasn't happy as you could imagine as I have pretty decent legs and I had to keep pulling them up past my knee which was embarrassing. For £35 I would of got a better pair from my local Wynsors and for alot less hassle. Good luck shopping with ASOS as you will need all the luck in the world with this site!!"

Stephanie (I believe that was her name, not quite sure) was very fast and helpful, she checked for me if the items were in stock and I decided to take my shot with this company. I got free 2-day shipping for spending over $140. The order was placed Saturday night and than Tuesday I received my package. The box was a little damaged (but that is exactly what the box is made for, so no complains about that as long as items are ok) thankfully items were not touched.

They offer student discounts and free shipping also. The free shipping is a MUST for a low-budget online shopper like myself, and not only was the shipping free, but it was extremely quick, arriving 3 days after I placed my order. I am also pleased with my return options- I received a shipping label in my order with easy-to-follow instructions on returning. I will definitely shop on ASOS again."

Not one person was helpful or even polite. Shocking service. There clothes are good but there service is terrible! Avoid at all costs.

When I checked the website it said the estimated delivery was Wednesday! When I tried to contact them to seek help to resolve there was no one to speak to and the chat advisers were rude and unhelpful. Really poor customer and delivery service.

"mber 19, 2017",1,"Inflexible, unhelpful and rigid policies","I am here not to rate their products, but their customer service. I am really disappointed with the customer service. It is the first time I needed help. I sent an order to the wrong address, realised later than an hour and no one could help me, even though the courier said that if Asos sends the correct address, it will be sorted. They kept on repeating the same thing. That they can't change the address, even though the first time I contacted them was before the order has been processed. And then I contacted Hermes. Hermes said that if Asos tell them the new address, they can change it, as they were the ones that placed the order. Fair enough. But Asos simply didn't want to help. They kept on trying to convince me that first it has to go to that wrong address, and then they might change it. But that was what I was trying to prevent as we recently moved and there are new tenants living there. That was the whole point of the ping pong between Asos and Hermes, two of the most rigid companies I ever came across. No one wanted to meet me half way. It turned out that I made the same mistake on Amazon, but they just didn't give up until they solved my problem. Excellent service.Update: The parcel was delivered to my old address, I went there but no one answered even though I announced my visit by post and after contacting ASOS again, I received a refund. This made the matter a bit better, but I still had to go buy a different Christmas present. So a lot of time and energy wasted for nothing."
"mber 18, 2017",1,Bad materials and inaccurate sizing,"I ordered three dresses from ASOS and all of them have a weird fit. It is not always clear what fabric they are made of and the sizing is waaaaay off. Two of my dresses look absolutely nothing like the pictures in real life. One of them even has a different color and length. The materials are mostly cheap but the dresses are quite expensive (for what you get), so all in all, too much of a risk for that price. I've had to fix all three dresses, making it even more expensive. Their delivery was also late."

In the meantime there was a burglary issue going on in our apartment, people was stealing others left packages in the entrance of the building by the couriers. My order has arrived two days before the wedding, I got the message to my phone, was out but never thought that the burglary can happen to me. I couldn’t find the package when I got back to home, knocked the doors of the neighbours, posted to the FB page of the building, no one has seen it. It was the middle of the night, and you can imagine how I was exhausted from all these wedding stuff, and things get went wrong. I reached the ASOS customer service, explained them the situation, and told them they were for my wedding a day after tomorrow. After a half an hour conversation, they told me they will send the order again, which I couldn’t believe. But the next day, at 7 or 8 am, they were really there! They perfectly fit and are smart. Now, I know what you think, that doesn’t sound a big thing maybe, but for a bride-to-be who dealt with bunch of problems, and customer services for 3 months, that was the fastest and easily solved problem. I mean they arrived only 7 hours after I reached them about the issue. So, really, they got the award for the best customer service in my own opinion.

And were ALSO the incorrect shoe size (again).Their rep mohammed tried to call me out and say that I got what I paid for -- claiming that the shoes I ordered were actually US 9 and that I should have read the sizing guide. I had to show him a photo of the actual shoe label saying that they were US 7.5, and their rep mohammed seemed upset about being corrected and now I will get a full refund and have to waste my time sending these shoes back to them. I have read reviews that they ""never received the returned shoes"" even when the post office confirms they received the package. I'll update this post if I get my money back -- if not, don't be a sucker like me."
"mber 15, 2017",1,Only order things you don't really need as you will probably not receive them anyway!!,"ASOS has some pretty nice things in good prices BUT being an e-shop means that they actually have to get them delivered to you as well. This would be a piece of cake if they co-operated with any decent, professional delivery company, instead of a bunch of lads. I ordered from Asos first time two years ago. My order was never delivered but the so-called delivery guy marked it as successfully delivered (either binned it somewhere or decided to keep the skirt for himself). I had to call the company and make a written complaint and I got my order a few days later. After that I wasn't very keen on ordering again but two years later, I convinced myself to try them again. This time I ordered a nice Superdry hoodie for my husband's birthday. The hoodie was supposed to come on or before his birthday and guess what. After I spent allllllll day at home waiting (since I kept receiving texts saying that they are coming in an hour or two) at around 8 o'clock in the evening I finally came to terms with the idea that I was once again played for a fool. I was left with such a dissapointment, a ruined birthday surprise and fifty something pounds less in my bank account. I am NEVER ordering from them again"
"mber 15, 2017",1,How could anybody at ASOS think a 3/10 …,How could anybody at ASOS think a 3/10 customer service rating is classed as customer service? I have never been so appalled at such a lack of empathy and willingness to provide *any* customer service whatsoever. Avoid at all costs. Please.
"mber 15, 2017",1,RUBBISH CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Having used ASOS for many years and now and being a Prime member, I am very disappointed at how little  ASOS care when thye Fu@k up! I ordered something yesterday for next day delivery - part of a birthday gift which I need for tomorrow. The item arrived today - completely smashed to bits, because some idiot thought it was appropriate to package GLASS tealight holders in a bit of bubble wrap and then put in the usual ASOS plastic bag. I contacted ASOS and basically they couldn't care less about the fact this is entirely THEIR error (i.e not an issue with the product itself being faulty but rather they have not packaged it appropriately, hence it arriving broken) they offered a refund OR a replacement and seemed to think they were doing me a huge favour by not requiring me to return the item! Why would I return something that smashed to bits??. Basically they have offered nothing by way of apology for the inconvenience their stupidity has caused. I tried to reiterate this several times but was simply told they don't offer compensation. All I asked was that they re-send the item(which by the way cost a measly £7 so no skin off their nose!) AND refund me by way of an apology. But this was too much for them it seems. For the sake of £7 they have disappointed and annoyed a loyal customer."
"mber 15, 2017",2,Used to love it,"Used to love it , but now there are hardly any small  sizes , always out of stock ! It's frustrating I had a premier account but stopped bothering"
"mber 15, 2017",1,I'm very upset with my most recent purchases!!,I'm very upset with my most recent purchase from ASOS. I bought a dress 6 size up because I had no expectation of it fitting someone who wear a size two. Dress comes a week and a half later and it doesn't fit I can't even put my head through it. Reorder two MORE size up so a 10 because hey it should fit right AND there's no other size offered. Dress gets lost in delivery it finally comes the day before I need it and it's too big another week and a half later. Sizing is  not accurate AT ALL I'M very disappointed in the products. Also to top it off my shoes don't fit at all both same size yet one too big and one too small. What's the point of a size chart when no one follow the measurements. Waste of time I will be sticking to traveling distance stores I just need my money back thank you very much.
"mber 15, 2017",1,AVOID THESE CROOKS Terrible terrible company will never …,"Terrible terrible company will never recommend again. Ordered item on November 9, 2017 for delivery to Canada for holiday events, having more than enough time for arrival. Shipping notification on November 11, December 14 still no package. Contacted ASOS on December 6 about missing package, told me shows it was out for delivery Nov 30 and I should ask neighbours and contact the post office, non option the package is gone. Under UK rules they need to deliver within 30 days or the agreed upon date  (November 28) but they dont care about business regulations, over a dozen emails refusing to do anything until December 16. Contacting ombudsman and my credit card company about this. Useless customer care, lazy workers, breaking uk rules. DO NOT BUY FROM ASOS"
"mber 14, 2017",1,"UNEXISTING,ARROGANT AND UNHELPFUL","My partner ordered a pair of gloves from the brand UGG but through Asos UK. Once we received the parcel, the gloves looked different compared to the picture on the Asos website. We re checked on the Asos website and noticed that the gloves in the box were not from the brand UGG but from Asos. It could have been considered like just a simple mistake but the ""Asos"" gloves were tagged with an UGG price tagg and packaged with an UGG box. So unless there is a magical trick, it looks like someone deliberately exchanged the gloves...We complained to Asos several times through twitter, by email and by phone...On Twitter I had a small hope because I managed to speak to someone but after a quick message no more news...On the phone we spoke to a manager who was extremely arrogant and who just tried during the whole discussion to put the blame on us...Really bad experience!!! To all customers, make sure to always check the product you receive because some employee from Asos can exchange a genuine product by a cheaper product without you noticing. Once done, it becomes a nightmare to deal with the customer service trust me"

Really??? I work for an online retail company who are excellent may I say, so I know that this is not true we have contact details for all our couriers.I was due my parcel Monday no one called to say it wasn't being delivered and I had a new timeslot so I missed Tuesday's, soooo I have no idea when I'm getting this!! Would not recommend this company to anyone!! Thanks ASOS! for nothing..."

I keep getting told someone from a spealist team will ring me back within 48 hours and that timescale has passed and no one has rang me.You have got my money and someone has used my card. Please take this more seriously and fulfil on your promises
"mber 14, 2017",5,I love Asos,"I love Asos. I have shopped with them many many times and will continue doing so. The shipping is good, the clothing is good, the prices are good. Maybe it's just me, I don't know. I should say that I am not a big fan of the recent website updates, but it's fine. I seriously can't find anything to complain about. Maybe only one suggestion: add more brands, Asos!"
"mber 13, 2017",1,Next Day = No day,"Ordered Saturday for Next Day, email confirmed Sunday delivery, new email stating Monday - delayed by one day, ok not ideal when you’ve paid for Next Day, Monday text arrives parcel is with UK Mail for evening delivery, come 10pm still no delivery, Tuesday and Wednesday also pass, Thursday tomorrow, no new notification - email customer services several times, no answer, no replies - shocking service. Will never use again. Ordered from House of Frazer on thre same day, which arrived without issue...! Be aware read the reviews...!!! Shop elsewhere."
"mber 13, 2017",1,Where can I start. Terrible service.. avoid at all costs...,"Where can I start.. I'm appalled with the service that I have received from Asos over the last few weeks. I always used to buy items from there, service was great, but the last couple of months the service has been horrendous.From ordering items that don't arrive, items arriving at click and collects but when I get there they advise they don't have them. When I speak to asos they say they will sort. 3-5 days to respond. Then when they respond they ask you questions then when you reply they ignore you for days.Currently have an outstanding parcel with a dress I need for a wedding which is next week. Orders the item start of December, should have been here 8th, texts advised to state item at shop.. trekked in the snow 3 Times to shop, shop say they don't have the parcel. Sent numerous messages. Noomr can give me answers.. I have one of my best friends weddings next week and currently out of pocket by £120, no dress and no replies.. shocking, horrendous, unbelievable, terrible, awful and down right bad customer service.. still awaiting yet another response. Surely mangers or the complaints department monitor this?"
"mber 13, 2017",4,Great if you don't have to deal with customer service!,"Pros:Premier delivery is great (when sent with DPD rather than Hermes).Large selection of products.Great sale prices.Cons:Dealing with customer services if something does happen to go wrong (which luckily rarely happens) is awful. When you eventually get a reply from them it's often a stock response that doesn't answer your specific query, so you have to go back and forth multiple times to get anywhere."
"mber 13, 2017",5,Great customer service,Great customer service. Responsive. I trust that issues I have will be fixed.
"mber 13, 2017",1,Great delivery service. The worst customer service.,"Great delivery service but customer service is some of the worst I've experienced. Any account issues need to go to a specialist team. No telephone service. Live chat can't help with anything meaningful.Bottom line is, if you have a problem - you've got no chance."
"mber 13, 2017",1,NEVER BUY VOUCHERS FROM ASOS!,"NEVER BUY VOUCHERS FROM ASOS!Purchased online vouchers but they have never arrived, they refused to refund or apologise so I am £50 out of pocket. They admit fault saying that the error happened “due to an unfortunate IT processing error which was out of their control” but they have no mechanism in place to refund as I purchased using Paypal, so essentially theft."

"mber 12, 2017",5,Shopping online experience,"I would recommend this website.It is totally safe.I did order a jacket,a backpack and a beanie hat.They all came in time and I always could track the orders.They came same as in the pictures and the size of the jacket was perfect.I will definitely shop again."
"mber 12, 2017",1,vanished order and asos ignoring me,I ordered a pair of shoes using next day delivery for a party. When they had not arrived two days later i contacted asos and they responded saying there had been trouble with them leaving the warehouse and i would not be receiving the items. Really bad customer service there was no apology and i was told the refund can take up to 14 days although the status on my delivery still says out for delivery and i am getting fobbed off by automated messages from asos. I always shop with asos and as a loyal customer this is really disappointing. The worrying thing is although someone on there web chat said i would be getting a refund this was not confirmed with any email or any status change on my orders on my asos dashboard. such a shame
"mber 12, 2017",5,Great customer service by Oscar,"Great customer service by Oscar via live chat.Solved my issue so quickly. they get busy sometimes thats why they respond late to customers, but thats not their fault they are trying hard."
"mber 12, 2017",1,Absolutely terrible customer service,"Absolutely terrible customer service, if you can argue it even exists. I requested for my order of value ~£200 to be left in a safe place in my rear garden by courier company DPD. I received a text message only, no note through the letter box, to let me know it was left there. It was no where to be seen when I arrived home later that day. DPD failed to take a photograph to support their claim that they left it my garden. This information took me 1 month and 1 week to receive after going back and forth several times with ASOS Customer Services, who repeatedly would let me know that they would get back to me within 48 hours/1 week etc - all time frames they set themselves, and of course failed to comply with, making this situation even more disappointing. Furthermore, getting my name wrong in their emails too, which is further evidence of their sloppy and careless customer service that I was provided with. It wasn't until I was on hold for over 20 minutes that I was given the information that I had been chasing via email, and only to be told that there is nothing they can do. Beyond disappointed and shocked at the low level of customer service provided by a company of their magnitude."

"mber 12, 2017",1,Failed deliveries and uninterested customer services!!,"Absolutely rubbish - as a long standing customer, I've used Asos for many years. I won't be using them again. I feel so strongly I've even emailed the top man, the CEO Mr Beighton, and told him his company is going downhill. I paid for next day delivery, didn't happen. When the delivery man did come,he delivered my parcel to some random address. I'd even got up from my sick bed and waited around for the two hour window I was given, but my order still went elsewhere. This wasn't the first problem with delivery, and, as many have said, customer services is shockingly poor too. Their responses are impersonal, patronising and simply template replies they send out. Eventually. I leave them feeling frustrated, angry and wholeheartedly disappointed, but in this day and age there is now a lot more choice out there. Why put up with appalling service and couldn't give a toss customer services when you can easily go elsewhere!"
"mber 11, 2017",1,This is the first but will be the last time i go to asos,"I swear i will never buy anything,  anything from asos again. This is the first but will be the last time. I bought a jumper for £20.60,  including £4.40 discount + £3.00 delivery.  The original price is £22.00. A day later i sent it back as its too big,  requested a smaller size.  They emailed me today saying they didnt have the size i wanted so they refund £17.60 because they deducted discount. So it means i paid £20 odd pounds but was refunded only £17.60 because of their problem????  Is it fair for buyers?  I bought 4 from amazon,  discounted price as well,  but i got full refund when i returned items to order smaller size.I feel like i got robbed.  Shocking customer service.  My sincere advice is NEVER,  NEVER  BUY ANYTHING FROM ASOS."
"mber 11, 2017",2,Asos has gone down the pan. All about profit now I suspect!!,"Asos used to be my go to site for so many different things. Been a loyal customer for going on 10 years and everything was always great, but after the last order I’ll be seriously reconsidering especially after the complete fudge from customer service with excuses. I ordered something, paid, then got the dispatch email the night before and then the delivery details on the morning of the delivery to only then getting a refund email for one of the items as it was “out of stock”!!?? How can an item thats been picked and ordered be out of stock?As i picked my delivery date to be the weekend instead of next day (tuesday) i seriously believe that they just picked it for someone else who ordered after me and left me high and dry to try and find something else for an xmas present for my girlfriend after all of the same items elsewhere are now out of stock because I wasn’t notified in time!!!"
"mber 11, 2017",1,NEVER ORDER WITH ASOS!!!! IT'S A TRAP!!!!!!!,"I ordered once and the item never arrived. They told me they had isolated issues and they were sorry blahblah.. they refunded me timely and it was fine. After almost 2 years since that, I thought I would give the store another chance. WORST MISTAKE EVER... I was supposed to recieve my parcel on nov 10-14th.. and since it didn't I contacted them through chat, and they said due to holidays there were delays, so I had to wait until nov 28th... and I did... and the items still didn't arrive.. So I contacted them.. yet again... and they told me to wait for december 3rd... which I did.. and the item STILL DIDN'T ARRIVE... and so.. I contacted them again via email since apparently the entire site is down or something so there was no chat available.. and they told me to check my address and the local post office and whatnot. Which I OBVIOUSLY DID THE FIRST TIME THE ITEM DIDN'T ARIRVE ON THE FIRST DATE.. and so I responded accordingly and all they could do was send me THE EXACT SAME MESSAGE 3 TIMES... and then.. IGNORE ME ... I am still waiting for a propper response and a refund!!!! I'm really starting to think they will actually rob me!! they've been ignoring my e mails for more than a week now!!! I don't know what to do!!! ONCE I HOPEFULLY GET MY MONEY BACK I'M NEVER EVER EVER ORDERING ON ASOS AGAIN!!!!!"
"mber 10, 2017",1,I used to love asos..,"I used to love asos... But my last several orders have been extremely disappointing. The coat I have ordered was the same brand and colour but completely different model. So dissatisfied, I can't even get the coat I originally ordered as it it's is out of stock. Won't be ordering from asos anytime soon, so disappointed"
"mber 10, 2017",2,They sell item that is not on stock!!,"They sell item that is not on stock!!! 2 weeks ago i made some purchase, i paid my order and wait for them to process the delivery. 4 days later they sent me an email said that my item is not on stock... and the customer care didn't help much."
"mber 10, 2017",1,Hugo boss brand infringement?,"I’m not sure what’s all this hype about ASOS about…To be honest, my first experience with ASOS was worse than the one on eBay with the Chinese seller and rating under 90 or it was a complete disaster in other words.After being suggested by my friends for a couple of months straight, I’ve finally decided to try it and buy a nice belt for my husband’s birthday. I’ve purchased not the cheapest HUGO BOSS dress belt and a week later received completely different look belt. On top of that, it seems like it was a cheat attempt, because the belt was chosen similar to the one ordered, expect that it was not Hugo boss but rather than ASOS belt where the ASOS letter on the back was painted black (not to see them). Whilst all this, belt still had the Hugo boss label on it.I’ve tried to contact ASOS and see if there were any quick solution to go around this (as I expected this to be a big mistake and to be dealt urgently), however all I’ve got is that I should send the incorrect item back and they will process my refund upon receiving the item in the next 30 days.For me, this is Hugo boss brand infringement to start with and I would expect ASOS to deal with this case in a much more efficient way.As you can imagine, my birthday gift was ruined and so was my experience with ASOS, so I will never use or suggest ASOS to anyone ever again."
"mber 10, 2017",2,"Stay away, that simple.","Their selection was nice. Their follow up horrible.  Ordered an item 11/28.  Today is 12/10. No word, tracking information is inaccurate, if at all. Furthermore, I have yet to receive a response from my inquiry on the general origin of my package. There are thousands of other options, us them instead."
"mber 10, 2017",1,dissapointment!,"My experience with Asos was sadly a really bad one, I ordered already a couple of times with asos, but my last one was so disappointing that it will be my last one. I ordered me a nice winter jacket around the black Friday sales event, five days overdue of the promised and paid shipping date I got the message that my package was unavailable to deliver, after contact with the customer service and a made promise that I will get my made purchases resend, I received the e-mail that because of security reasons I can´t get my already paid purchases. After a couple of back and forth emails I let the customer service know that I don´t have interested in a refund but to receive my products, this was sadly ignored and I got refunded. I got the offer that I can rebuy my products but since they weren´t on clearance anymore this time it would cost me 60 $ more which is obviously unacceptable. My emails have been ignored since. Just a giant disappointment and loss of trust :-("
"mber 09, 2017",1,Shockingly bad customer service,Shockingly bad customer service. Was told my order failed and I had to place it again. So I did and then the original order managed to go through.  Left without money at Christmas time until they can deliver it return it and then wait for  refund. Staff telling me different things. No compensation or meaningful apology. Will never shop with them again.
"mber 09, 2017",5,Great Service !!!,ASOS really are the best online shopping company in my eyesTheir website is easy to use and full of choice.The returns process is unbelievably easy and freeAnd in the unlikely event you do have to contact customer services they reply very quickly and its clear its not just an automated reply but someone has actually took the time to read your issue and come back to you
"mber 09, 2017",5,Asos has never disappointed me,Asos has never disappointed me! And i've been buying stuff from their site for many years. All these negative reviews are quite surprising and difficult to grasp. I absolutely recommend Asos.- delivery on time-good quality- easy to return-no problems with refunds
"mber 09, 2017",1,Asos Clothing. Poor customer service.,Asos.  You get a better service from a back street market that this rubbish. Bad customer service. They lost my parcel 3 weeks ago with DPD. Keep sending me round in circles saying that they have to wait for updates. They don’t know the meaning of the word 48 hours. Chat service is totally rubbish. .  They give wrong information. They took 100 pounds offme for my goods never received. Trying to get my money back is an uphill struggle. Looks like they don’t want to give it back. Do not order from this company as they are only there to get your money and no customer service. Band of people who can’t make heads or tail of conversation work there.
"mber 09, 2017",1,Disappointed,"I have ordered from asos quite a few times over the years with no problems, i received an item that was missing a part and having just received an email back (4 days later) that wasn't helpful at all, i decided to use the chat now option they have on the website. This wasn't helpful in the slightest! Im sending everything back an never ordering from them again, very very disappointed with their rubbish customer service."
"mber 09, 2017",1,Awfull customer service and delivery,"4 orders in a row that are delivered after the estimated date. For the last they provided an estimated delivery time of 10 days (shipping within EU - long time but I thought ""at least they should not fail this time"") and it's been 15 days and I am yet to receive the order. Contacted CS who told me to wait even longer. I asked if they could contact their courier to understand if there was any issue and the insolent told me ""the courier is yours. I work for asos"". zero attention for customer satisfaction.UPDATE: contacted courier my self who of course told me they could only speak with asos.They eventually agreed to send replacement order that I hope to receive on the following business day (courier already contacted me). But in the meantime it’s been a month to ship something within the EU. My opinion about their customer service (specially their tone and willingness) is very poor."
"mber 08, 2017",2,Take responsibility,"Long story short I ordered a size 9us women Chelsea boot I REALLY WANTED and was excited I was able to order since stock was already low. I received the wrong size (Im assuming uk8 since they fit at least 2-3 sizes too big) I chatted with CSR I was told a replacement with the right size would be sent, check email within 48 hrs for further info. After about 4 days still no email I chatted with CSR again, only to be told too bad so sad the item is out of stock, send back your pair for a refund. Only problem is I ordered the shoes because I REALLY wanted them, I expressed thoroughly how a refund would NOT make me happy- I want my shoes in the size delivered! CSR could of at least attempted to take some sort of responsibility with some type of coupon or something. I dont see how the, sending me the wrong size when I ordered correctly results in me ending up as an unsatisfied customer. The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because they have a good catalog, but it serves them no good if they advertise what they don't have or cant deliver on."
"mber 08, 2017",1,Avoid ASOS,"I rarely write reviews because I do not see the point of doing this, but I have to.Anyway, Iong story short - Ordered items (worth 36 pounds) from ASOS, never arrived.I tried to contact ASOS through their facebook, and they told me they would do a refund within 2 days. As I paid through paypal, I was hoping to get the money back soon. However, it has been more than 2 days and I am not getting my money refunded!!!! I tried contacting their customer service again but they do not reply.Avoid this company at all cost."
"mber 08, 2017",1,Horrendous service,"Horrendous service, horrible staff! Tight company, such a shame as the website has decent clothes but the brand itself is terrible. No customer care whatsoever, actually hope they go bust and amazon to dominate clothing industry too."
"mber 08, 2017",4,Everything I ordered came,"Everything I ordered came,  was a bit disappointed with the packaging tho I ordered a top for my boyfriends christmas and it came in a really small box all squashed together with all my other items,   But they also threw in a box of free chocolates.    So pretty happy with that"
"mber 07, 2017",1,Not once do they ever feel apologetic,Not once do they ever feel apologetic. I almost feel criminalized for their errors. Received a completely different order. Went through three customer service three different days. All rude. Not one of them wanted to help. They just lost a loyal customer. I didn’t receive half my order now that it’s out of stock due to this error. So disappointing.
"mber 06, 2017",4,I'm paying money for Asos's mistake,"ASOSThis is the first time I'm using social media to complain about any kind of company. I'll start from the end: Asos is making me pay for their mistake, and I'm paying with my time, energy and money.Two weeks ago I made an order on the website, then forgot to insert a discount code, and I immediately canceled it. I received confirmation for the cancellation which said the order status has been updated to 'cancelled'. However, a few hours later I received an email saying the order is on its way. Reaching Asos's costumer service, I was explained that there was a glitch in the system proceeding the order, and there is nothing they can do to cancel it (approximatly 3 hours after the order was placed).The only way I can get a refund is to wait for the package to arrive, return it myself, wait until it will get back to Asos (up to 21 business days), and then wait an additional 5-6 business days.Alongside spending my time and energy on e-mailing and for the return itself, I have to pay for duty taxes and the bank's foreign coin commission.At first, asking about the delivery payment, Asos took responsibility. When I asked about duty taxes (37 GBP) Asos costumer care stopped replying. I am at my last hope regarding this. I am out of ideas on how to not lose money for a mistake I am not responsible for in any way. Hoping this post could somehow help move things along and avoid any more losses on my behalf."
"mber 06, 2017",2,Bad experience with the deliveries,"Have ordered now twice from Asos after moving to Stockholm in Sweden. Both times the delivery experience has been awful, first time paid extra for next day delivery - First of all it didn't arrive the next day, second I was not informed anywhere that I actually need to be home the whole day on the day they will deliver to be able to receive the order, or otherwise I won't be able to collect it from anywhere until the next time they can try to deliver it to me. Had I known this I could have stayed home and waited for the package since I was going for a holiday the day after. Second time I ordered with a standard delivery, where DHL was the carrier. The order was delivered to a DHL service point 2 days later than promised (overall the delivery took 1,5 weeks) and to a service point that is several kilometers from where I live in. No explanation from Asos why the order has been delivered to this service point and not to one closer to where I live (there are several) or no help with getting the order delivered to a closer pick up point. Also no e-mail or sms from dhl informing about the state of the delivery... Very disappointed with the company, the shopping experience is far from smooth!"
"mber 06, 2017",1,If I could add no stars I would,"If I could add no stars I would. I would never order anything from asos again. By the time I get my refund on a returned item, it will be close to 3 weeks. They do all their customer service via Facebook messsenger; taking days to get a straight answer. Its an absolute joke. Asos are too tight to have anyone on a phone line. I'd expect business practice like this from an eBay stellar, selling clothes from their bedroom. I wonder, if they had a complaints department, would that be run through tinder?I would recommend no one purchases any item of clothing, unless they have no intention of returning it."
"mber 06, 2017",4,Good return service,"Good items, and return service perfect."
"mber 06, 2017",1,NOT WORTH THE HASSLE SHOP ELSEWHERE!,Took them 3 weeks to admit my order was lost. They then told me they would send a replacement next day delivery. Waited another 5 days and nothing arrived. I contacted them again for them to tell me items were out of stock and the boots would be sent standard delivery 4 weeks after my original order was placed and after saying they would be sent out next day delivery. Boots still not arrived. Terrible customer service AVOID!!
"mber 06, 2017",1,I am very disappointed with this …,I am very disappointed with this company! They have sent me shoes two sizes to large. After paying for express shipping I was charged an additional charge upon arrival. The worst part is that they don't have a customer service phone number !!!! How are you selling your product nationally with out a 1-800 number !!!!! SO FRUSTRATING.
"mber 05, 2017",1,Always having order issues with asos,Always having order issues with asos and the customer service is terrible. Ordered a pair of boots that came faulty. Having spoke to the customer service team they assured me a replacement would be sent through next day delivery. 2 days later and still no boots. Got in contact again and apparently the boots are out of stock. Did not get in contact with me to let me know. Had to chase it up myself whilst they took days at a time to respond. Not the first time something like this has happened with asos. Will not be purchasing from them again.
"mber 05, 2017",1,I have had multiple issues with ASOS …,"I have had multiple issues with ASOS orders. From delays in orders with no explanation as to why, to customer services taking days to get back to me about my order. They promise next day delivery but very rarely have I actually received my item the next day. Don't call it next day delivery if it's not going to be."

"mber 05, 2017",1,Great customer disservice,"Great customer disservice! They have messed up my orders sending something I have cancelled and cancelling the actual order for a tech failure. After that they told me they couldn't stop the order because it was already  processed (this was a lie since they sent an email 5 days later saying one of the items was unavailable). So they took my payment for an order I didn't want and they didn't block the order from leaving the warehouse in 7 days!Then they told me to send the order I didn't want back to the them and since this was not my fault I could send them a proof a postage to have issued the refund asap. Obviously nothing of this happened. I still didn't get my money back despite sending an order in first instance wasn't supposed to leave the warehouse back with proofs of postage. It's worth to add that in all this process I have been ping ponged from a customer service to the other, staying hours waiting for chats or their calls. also funny, if you have been put in the call queue through the chat and you contact them again through chat to ask why they didn't call you they will automatically kick you out from the call queue and the queue is said to be up to 24h. When I have spoken with them, everyone was saying different things and the girl at the phone was very rude. after they have started ignoring me and they replied to my messages just when posting publicly on FB. So what to say more? I have shopped asos a few times and Variety of items is good but the management of this company is awful, personally I have an order supposed to arrive today not with me and around £100 in their hostage...I would recommend to buy your stuff somewhere else."

Eight hours later an email arrived to say ""sorry your delivery has been delayed"". End of emails...So after stupidly waiting 2 days I message ASOS to ask for news. A day later they sent apologies, but they'd investigate and said ""please allow for 2 working days for a response"".Two days later no news, so I chase. The reply was ""your parcel is being returned to our warehouse for an automatic refund...please allow for 7 working days for it to arrive at our warehouse...it can take 5 working days [thereafter for the cash] to appear in your account"". As they didn't ask me if I wanted it returned I assumed they'd lost the parcel and were just using ""returned to warehouse"" as an excuse to hold on to my money. They have now sent me a dpd link to prove the parcel is on its way back to them (not me!) and I got an email from paypal to say ASOS are not refunding my delivery charge of £5.95. The pain continues! AVOID ASOS"

Original date was 29th but then it changed to 5th December which is a farcical lead time of 8 days. 5th December and still no order. My account on ASOS has no order number, no tracking details and no order update details. I won't ever use them again, I get most of my stuff from Surfdome and will go back to their exceptional service. How long can a company stay in business with service like this. I spent £175 with ASOS and still no sign of my stuff.. Very poor indeed and stay away and look elsewhere."

I message Asos again and after the 6th colleague I spoke to I get told my order has been lost in the warehouse and they will do a replacement order, 4 days after that I'm still messaging them asking about my order,they refuse to let you talk to management,I've been in a que for 5 days just to get a phone call back..

Called the delivery company after 2 days they answered to the phone after listening to their robot for 20 min and told me that the label on the item has been damaged and i will not receive it, and that i should contact asos. I contacted asos and they told me they will give me the discount to buy it again and that i should wait 21 days to get a refund but i can order it again after already having it paid. Never again!!!

"mber 03, 2017",1,Shocking customer service.,Shocking customer service. My order did not arrive and no one tried to deliver it and DPD claimed that a different surname signed for it. I took this up with customer service who contacted DPD and then swiftly closed the case without offering me a refund or replacement parcel. Claiming that gps coordinates Place them at my flat block door and that my name was not on the electoral register. A complete lie! I have contacted the council to confirm I was on the electoral register but still no refund. Slow and shocking service! I have been a loyal customer for years and would not use this company ever again
"mber 03, 2017",1,Disappointed,"Brought a hoodie that was the wrong size, went to return it and accidentally sent back the wrong item, got in contact with them and asked if they where able to send the wrong items back so we could then send the correct items back even offered to pay for shipping, they then told us that they where not going to bothering trying to go and look for our items, and we will not get a refund for the hoodie that is in the wrong size."

Spent 30 minutes on their chat system, received zero apology and was basically told they couldn't help at all. It was not what I expected, however reading some of the reviews on here now clearly I'm not alone!"

Don’t they want customers to buy their stock? I don’t know what is more disappointing and annoying: the lack of empathy, the absence of assistance, the complete failure of solutions to problems,or the attitude of not giving a damn."
"mber 03, 2017",1,Annual next day delivery a con,Asos used to be brilliant! I’ve shopped online with them for years but lately you can see their focus is no longer the customer! BEWARE when you pay for the whole year next day delivery option you don’t always get next day delivery as I’ve just found out and there’s no refund or apology for itAlso returns take ages to process- I was told item not yet reclaimed back then I sent them the tracking number that confirmed it was received 3 days ago-even then after they finally confirmed they had received the item back I still had to wait a further 4 days for it to go through their process which then only raises the refund that can take another 7days on top! So quick to take the money out but not so quick to refund it! Seriously put off from using asos now - it’s not what it used to be

Normal delivery is occasionally not as reliable but ASOS prime you usually get a one hour slot and definitely next day delivery. You can request to have things left in a specific place/at a neighbours too :D If you live near a post office it is extremely easy to send things back aswell so I am very happy with the service!
"mber 01, 2017",1,Absolutely shocking,Absolutely shocking. I bought some items on a next day delivery. 3 days later I haven't received anything. Their courier Hermes are terrible and claim to have posted it through my letter box. This is not the case. I have complained to ASOS and so far nothing has been done. I am now trying to get my money back. 3rd time this has happened in 6 weeks.
"mber 01, 2017",1,The utmost unreliable and crappy …,"The utmost unreliable and crappy customer service. Bunch of deplorables working at Asos. I pay for two day shipping only to receive my items 4 days later. Customer service reps are unintelligent, rude, and even had one by the name of ""Denise"" end a chat on me. No one is held accountable for their actions, and no apologies."

"mber 01, 2017",2,Customer Service lets them down,"If I was judging them on there clothes and price point I'd probably give them a solid 4 out of 5. There customer service however below par. Some staff are quite rude, probably stressed and under paid but hey ho. There courier service they use, hermes are really bad. You cannot collect from there depot, you cannot track there courier by gps location, they do not give estimated delivery times, you cannot change an address or time etc. Asos also have very poor relationships with their couriers. Asos cannot change a delivery address and cannot contact their couriers to request they change a delivery address. So with Asos what let's them down is the processes, the couriers and the restrictions the staff work in which do not unable them to provide the best customer care, i believe this is why they can be rude sometimes. On the plus side I quite like the clothes and pricepoint, it's only when an issue arises is where Asos show there weakness."

Unless I purchased another pair of boots? They also couldn't guarantee to have them in stock once they had investigat their problem . Nor that the next box would have the correct boot either..I asked to speak to a manager,  or for a manager to phone me(as they have no phone no to call). This too had a 48 hour wait.. this is all done by instant messaging.. had to go elsewhere in the end.. still didn't receive a call or email from them . Disgusting customer services.. Not the employees fault.. it was out of their hands.. there just wasn't any way for them to help me"
"November 30, 2017",1,Worst customer service I've ever …,Worst customer service I've ever experienced. Waited for two weeks for delivery with endless promises that my order would be arriving soon. They eventually admitted that they had never even sent the order but that a replacement would be sent immediately. That was a week ago and still no sign of anything arriving.No answers to any of the emails I sent so I had to call their call centre to actually get someone to deal with and every time I was told a different story.
"November 30, 2017",3,Love / Hate Relationship with ASOS.,"I have been ordering from ASOS for so many years, I can't even remember how long I've been a customer! A few pros:1) Their premier service is fantastic. They use a fantastic delivery company that provides very good tracking on my items - all for £9.99 a year! (I dread to think how much I would have spent on delivery if it wasn't for this service) 2) On the whole, I have always found that my returns have been processed within a reasonable time-frame with no quibble. 3) Their new voucher scheme is an added bonus. I shop with ASOS a lot and this little perk means that I often try and find branded items here vs. from the actual brand itself. I want to give a fair review and so I have to mention ASOS' biggest negative - which is their customer service. On the rare occasion that something does go wrong, I am filled with utter dread because this means I am going to have to deal with the customer service team. This is the reason I have only awarded ASOS 3*. My biggest issue with their team is that they don't actually seem to listen. They instead come back to you with generic responses (which sometimes don't have anything to do with your query). You also end up speaking to several different people (over a very dragged out period of time) and as a result, end up having to repeat yourself over and over again. It's a very frustrating and time-consuming process. Would I recommend ASOS? Absolutely - they offer great customer perks and when things go smoothly, they are a fab company BUT do be aware that their customer service is seriously lacking."
"November 30, 2017",1,Horrendous - avoid!!,Horrendous. Taking to every media platform I can. Useless ‘help’ team that take a ridiculous time to get back to you. No help on delivery or refunds. Not willing to help either. Ridiculous that you cannot speak to anyone over the phone.

"November 30, 2017",1,ASOS next day delivery nonexistent,ASOS next day delivery means you will receive your items 3 days later. Customer service is nonexistent as well. Would really consider before ordering anything from them as you might not know when your delivery will arrive.
"November 30, 2017",1,Asos was good some 6 years ago now it's …,"Asos was good some 6 years ago now it's a joke. 2 consecutive orders each of 200 EUR never arrived. They keep  telling you to wait long after the estimated delivery time. Once I ordered dresses for a holiday didn't get any, now in November for my birthday, didn't get any. They should just close down there's plenty of other stores around that are very efficient like Zalando, Yoox and singular brand shops. Bye bye ASOS"
"November 30, 2017",1,Furious,"Ordered a dress one week ago and was expecting it today, when I didn't recieve it I thought I would investigate so I looked at my asos account to see delivery status only to find out there was 'order issues' . Wasn't sure if that meant it was sent or not so reached out to two different customer care reps and that was proven pointless as the only help they could offer me was apology after apology. I was told to re order and get express shipping if i needed it in time for next weeks event. Went to renorder and the item was out of stock! Why wouldn't they email me and notify me so I could re order straight away. Furious. Honestly don't waste people's time."

Thank you ASOS for continually providing the best clothes and the best customer service."
"November 28, 2017",1,This is an aobhorrent company,"This is an aobhorrent company. I placed an order on Asos for the first time well ahead of the time I needed the items. I checked yesterday to find out the status of my order and discovered that there was NO trace of it in my Asos account. I checked Paypal and saw that Asos had actually cancelled my order, without even letting me know! When I reached out to a customer rep on the chat he literally ignored every single question I had, literally didn't investigate anything. All he kept saying that he needed a ""confirmation number"", which I obviously did not have. Why would Asos have sent a confirmation number AFTER they rejected my order?I reached out to Asos again today, and was told that my order was rejected due to a technical issue. No explanation as to why I wasn't informed. Nothing. I was forced to reorder the items and when asked if they could at least expedite it, they said no. When I asked for store credit for the expedited shipping ""we don't do store credit"". When I asked for a code to waive the expedited shipping cost he said ""we have none"". After pushing, he said he can give me code to use to for shipping reimbursement AFTER I've paid for expedited shipping and RECEIVED my clothes. When I asked if the shipping reimbursement is guaranteed if I use the code, he ignored my question. Then he told me I should wait two days before I need the dress, if there is no ""tracking update"" then we can explore further steps. Unreal.So I was forced to shell out a lot of money to expedite an order I need in a few days. When I received the shipping information, Asos added 3 days to their processing time because of the black Friday sales, so it looks like my order will arrive days after I need it. Guess I'll just be the  bridesmaid wearing a completely different dress from the rest.Amazing."
"November 28, 2017",1,"""Computer says no."" Common sense would …","""Computer says no."" Common sense would allow a cancellation period of at least 24 hours when you're not going to be delivering the item for 8 long days, but their ridiculous computerised system lacks this. An 8-day delivery window is too late for my needs, and to add insult to injury, I have subsequently found the  dress in question on the Reiss website at £65 cheaper than on Asos. £190 from Asos, £125 from Reiss.I think it's over between me and Asos.They have outpaced themselves. They had the edge over many other companies but have now sabotaged themselves with inefficiency, unable to keep up with demand or implement a user-friendly customer service ethic."

I'm glad the articles arrived before my event so I give them credit for that and I'm very thankful.  However, going through the stress and worrying about what dress to wear to an event is a horrible thing to experience.  Not to mention, the hassle you had to go through to ""chat"" with their customer service.  I was on chat with them for at least 30 minutes pleading my case. **************************AVOID SHOPPING AT ASOS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOUR MONEY.   To make this review simple:1)  I paid for 2-day express shipping for extra $12;2)  I received confirmation that my package was delivered, ONLY IT WAS DELIVERED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS.  Delivered in Texas, I'm in California.3)  They are sending me a new shipment but will get to me days after I actually need the items I ordered.  **crossing my fingers that I actually receive the package**4)  I asked for them to send the new shipment to me via 2-day shipping since I paid for it.5)  They won't send it via 2-day shipping.4)  They won't refund me back my express shipping fee. This is not the first time that I've had a recent problem with ASOS.  I've been a customer for years and never had issues but for some reason, their customer service has changed in the recent months and this is the last time I'm ordering from them."

The free returns are great, if you hate something you can return it for free!! I admit, the ASOS brand can be quit cheap quality wise, but that can be expected from a fast fashion realtor."

No thy just give me a refund every time meaning I have to re order every time it's just ridiculous and the customer service is horrendous not to mention when receiving the parcel it is always battered and half open
"November 24, 2017",2,"Great selection, poor customer service",I have ordered a few times off ASOS and have several points for future buyers to note.1) The ASOS branded clothes are cheaply made - avoid at all costs2) Their designer selection is great but often out of stock3) The customer service to Australia is poor - you have to use web chat or email. They are unwilling to assist with order issues once it is shipped and will make you liaise with the carrier.4) Several times I have ordered off ASOS and eithera) They have delivered to the wrong addressb) Sent me the wrong orderc) Did not specify they would be using a courier instead of their previous option of Royal Mail to ship goods and hence could not deliver to a Parcel Lockerd) Had missing items in my orderNot once have they offered compensation. I have learnt my lesson. Avoid ASOS at all costs!!

However i tried to do my christmas shopping as usual and I was locked out of both my accounts!!! When i contacted the Customer service they told me the fraud team has decided to block my profil because it looked suspiscious, NON SENSE! I worked in a fraud team before, when the investigation is done you either confirm the fraud or release the client's profile. ASOS even said they took a ""Business decision"", so it's a business decision to shut down a genuine client??? UNBELIEVABLE!!! I am baffled at the their customer service, extremely poor, especially for someone like me who has been their client for 6 years!!! I don't have the words to express my frustration!!!"

(should be 24 but is 42). 42 doesnt existi have contacted asos and they have no method of contacting hermes to change the delivery or cancel it. which is ridiculous.Hermes cannot change any details without asos' permission so it is a never ending circle.Hermes Live chat is AWFUL as the assistants cut you off and rudely tell you they cannot help.Hermes also dont have a helpline as there contact number doesnt go through its just an automated service.Hermes tell me they cannot leave the parcel with a neighbour and cannot cancel the delivery so my parcel that ive paid for is just sitting with hermes who are going to attempt to deliver it 3 more times TO AN ADDRESS THAT DOESNT EXIST, before finally they will send it back to the retailer where i still wont receive my order.The process between asos and hermes is rediculous as hermes tell you asos need to contact them and asos tell you they cant contact hermes.So you cant do anything.I just have to sit here and repeatedly let me item fail delivery until eventually my item will be returned to asos by default and i will get a refund.Then have to pay a higher price for an item that was on sale.Both companies just repeatedly pass you back and forward to eachotherTHE WORST SYSTEM THE WORST COMPANYTHE WORST STAFFAND I WILL NEVER USE HERMES OR ASOS AGAIN IF THEY ARE STILL LINKED!!!!!!AVOID THIS AT ALL COST I WILL HAPPILY PAY EXTRA DELIVERY COST TO SEND MY ITEM BY A DIFFERENT COMPANY."

"November 22, 2017",1,Cancel order to make you pay £20 extra,"So just a few days ago, we ordered a pair of Adidas Original Gazelle shoes that were reduced from £75 to £52.50These were ordered as they were a product that were fantastic value for money at that price. Click and collect from a local newsagent was selected to make sure these were delivered efficiently and without paying for unnecessary delivery. Here’s where the issues came in. The item was consistently delayed until contact with the customer service team at ASOS was contacted. Suddenly the item was returned to their warehouse. Rather than resend the item, ASOS told us that we could reorder these as they were in stock, and after 10 days our current order would be refunded. However, reordering these would cost the original £75. So it seems apparent that these trainers were not sent out, and that ASOS decided to give no option but to spend an extra £20 to complete the order. Will not be using them again as they tried to unfairly dupe us out of the price we had ordered at the time. Awful service"
"November 22, 2017",1,WORST SERVICE!!,"Absolutely shocking service!! I returned to suit jackets which were delivered Monday early morning this week. Asos are not refunding my money, state they have to allow up to 8 working days. Who takes this long to refund an item. I work in customer service myself, if a customer returns an item I will always refund this straight away! Aim is to always keep our customers happy, obviously Asos do not care about customers at all. Just want money money money. I would not recommend ordering, always best to go out and buy something you are looking for. DONT BUY!!If you decide to read this, my order number is 294138095. Please refund my items which you have."

I never received the item but instead got a refund which I never asked for. ASOS should not Bragg about worldwide delivery when they cannot deliver outside UK. Worst experience with ASOS, highly unprofessional. I asked customer care to get me in touch with someone higher whom I can share my concern with but they failed to do so  and now I am in loss of 22 pounds. 0 stars"

I returned my order as both items were damaged on receipt, return system was easy enough but it has now been over 3 weeks since the order was returned and after no replies to my emails I've had to escalate to Paypal for my money to be refunded back to me, which I am still waiting for. Appauling service."

The only issue i did have is my ASOS 'A lister' dropped down a level because i hadn't ordered in around a month? which is a bit disappointing considering i ALWAYS order with them and spend a lot. After having ANOTHER, TERRIBLE experience with Misguided i really do appreciate the easiness of using ASOS and their customer service (Like i said i have never had any issue when dealing with them). Keep doing what you're doing ASOS and i will continue to only ever really order with you! Brill!"
"November 21, 2017",5,Love ASOS,I´ve bought so many items from ASOS and the few times I´ve had an issue with an order it´s been resolved with their customer service very quickly! I´m located in Denmark and I usually have my items within a week.
"November 21, 2017",1,Can’t fault the products but customer care is dreadful,Can’t fault the products but the customer care is terrible. I spent 15 minutes talking to ‘mckenzie’ (false name presumably) who sent a couple of stock replies and hung up.  I then spent another 40 minutes waiting for ‘SACCHI’ to send a stock reply every 6 minutes or so.  At the end SACCHI also hung up though she did wish me a good day first I suppose.  Not sure it was genuine tbh :/ is there even a real person at the other end I wonder. So ASOS minus points for the worst customer care I’ve experienced in a very long time. And SACCHI FIND YOUSELF A DIFFERENT JOB CUSTOMER CARE IS NOT FOR YOU DEAR

"November 21, 2017",1,Worst experience ever,"I was buying a suit for my boyfriend for race day and I need it for the 10 November, before making my purchase I contacted ASOS to confirm that it would come in time for the event before paying for it, they told me it would be there before or on the 9 November. So I made the purchase, it’s was a day later and I never received a email to confirm that it been shipped so I contact them again ASOS told me it would arrive on time. It was the 9 November and it never came I contacted ASOS at 4pm and asked them where was my parcel they told me it would be delivered that day between 4 and 10pm at night and of course it never came. It was the 10 November and still no suit my boyfriend had nothing to wear for Raceday and had completely ruined the whole event. When I contacted ASOS AGAIN they told me it wasn’t coming till the 16 November??? A whole week later but told me the day before that it would arrive on time, I asked for refund they refused until I got the parcel but I decided if the suit fit that I would still keep it. Well I never even got the parcel the only that turned up was the tie i was missing the suit jacket, vest and pants and when I contact ASOS about the missing items on the 18 November they sent me other tie after clearly stating that I ONLY RECEIVED A TIE and was still missing the other items. They sent me another email saying they we’re sending a replacement straight away and I would receive the suit soon. But then got I email from PayPal saying they refund the suit jacket, pants and vest, but not the tie i was confused. Anyway the next day they emailed me to tell me they were out of stock so they were giving me a refund that I asked for weeks ago. I went through all this stress for nothing hands down the worst experience ever, I thought I was doing the right contacting ASOS to make sure I would get my order they promised be not once but 4 times but clearly I was wrong they just lied and told me what I wanted to hear so they didn’t have to deal with it. I will never buy anything from this company again and if you are expecting to receive the items you paid for then you will not purchase from this company too."
"November 20, 2017",1,ASOS are thieving AHOLES,"Stole my money after cancelling my order so have not received the goods. Won't have known about this if I didn't contact them.

Have now contacted my bank directly to get my money back. I will never buy from them again!"
"November 19, 2017",1,Poor customer service,"Poor customer service. My NUS card doesn't work when ordering. The help function takes you through to their chat. I spoke with someone who assured me that my query would be dealt with within 48hrs. 3 days went by and I heard nothing, not even an acknowledgement via email. I used chat again and was told I had to wait another 48 hrs, the NUS deal is only on for another day! I wasn't given any reason why my query wasn't dealt with in the original timeframe. This is poor in comparison to other fashion retailers. When I asked for an email address to contact ASOS on, I was told there isn't one."

Customer service wasn’t all that cracky either. So tempted to not shop with asos anymore. I can buy all the branded stock from the brands websites. Asos used to be so good. I just can’t believe I’ve been sent the wrong shoes 4 times. Oh and each time I’ve spoken to an advisor, they’ve all followed the same script! Seriously laughable!!"

I could not log in to access any information and was unsure whether the order was being processed. Days of emailing them ensued.  Every email told me to log in and change my account details.

Not sure what's happened to ASOS lately but the service is horrific now - I mean really, stuff you couldn't even make up because it's so unrealistically bad.  Not delivering things but insisting they have, not refunding things for weeks (telling me they haven't received the items when I arranged a collection through them - and then the onus is one me to prove!), every email I send is replied to by a different person (possibly automated responses), they've changed the website to MAKE IT HARDER TO ARRANGE A RETURN (!!), no customer service phone number, everything I want is always sold out (take it off the bloody site then).I'm closing my account, I keep romanticising about the old days but it's too much of a liability now and they do not deserve my business. Even if they occasionally get it right - there's more chance of aggregation these days."

"November 14, 2017",5,I love ASOS!,I love ASOS. I have been ordering through them for a number of years now and I have no complaints. The delivery is always really quick. I have returned products that weren't right or arrived damaged without much effort. It is quick and easy. I was very impressed when I had to return a Bridesmaid dress (I had bought it for my sister) because she had got pregnant and didn't fit into it anymore. The dress had been purchased about 5 months prior and they still issued me a refund. I wasn't expecting that. In fact I was hoping for at most an exchange.Ultimately ASOS may not always deliver perfect goods but they always resolve any issues and I for one am very happy with the service.

In August I had an email telling me there was suspicious activity on my account and that as a security measure my account would be locked. I merely had to reply to get it working again. This was 3 months ago. Each time I have contacted ASOS the company apologises, tells me they are dealing with it within 24 hours, refuses to reply within 24 hours, then replies with another convoluted problem or way of delaying actually unblocking my account. I paid for priority delivery, I haven't been able to use this for 3 months. I have vouchers built up which are about to expire. I last emailed 9 days ago and was given the usual apology and promise to respond within 24 hours . I have heard nothing since. Terrible customer service and the company has been happy to take my money for priority delivery and for a quarter of the year for which I have paid, I have had no access. Terrible customer service. Shop with Boohoo instead."

"November 12, 2017",2,Flawed customer service :(,I wouldn't return faulty items for replacement as you might not get it back.The replacement process for me has involved 8 contacts with different customer service advisers at every point. I was told at first that I would be sent a replacement and that I should return the faulty item. I returned the faulty item and didn't receive anything after 8 days (3-5 day delivery expected). A refund for my purchase was then issued and I was told the item was no longer in stock. I contacted asking why I wasn't told this at the time (as I would've kept the it and made do). After 5 contacts I was finally told that the return/replacement department has a 48 hour delay and that the item must have gone out of stock in that time. I was not given a replacement and since ASOS was the cheapest retailer for this item I had to purchase the same item for much more elsewhere. I lost a significant amount of time dealing with the complaint and ended up spending more money than I wanted.The item in question was from Rains and could've have been replaced under their 12 month warranty has ASOS used it. The item is still in production and it seems that the item is only out of stock because ASOS don't wish to sell it anymore.Unacceptable processes behind the scenes led to an unacceptable outcome and this will likely happen again to other people.

I had used PayPal to pay, and therefore raised query via them. Had response to give me order number, but no explanation why not received originally. Now move on to their delivery company of choice Hermes.

They were quick to help and I sent them pictures and they gave me a refund immediately. They were kind and courteous on the phone and eager to help. I will definitely be shopping on the site in the future. P.S. the $19 free shipping deal is sooooo worth it!!
"November 09, 2017",1,I will never order from ASOS again,"I will never order from ASOS again. I ordered two items for a Halloween costume in early October (keeping in mind that it would take a couple of weeks to ship) and got a notification that my items were shipped on October 10th and would arrive in Canada by October 30th. It is now November 9th and my package is nowhere to be found. I contacted customer service twice, and not only do they not know where my parcel is, but they will not even submit a refund until November 15th ""just in case it still turns up"". By November 15th this will have been a 5 week + shipping process, which is completely ridiculous for a company as large as ASOS. I highly recommend finding other places to shop that do not treat their customers this way."
"November 09, 2017",1,I'm so angry and upset with ASOS,"I usually have good experiences with ASOS but my god they need to put better people in their customer care department who actually give a crap about you. DPD has lost my package and ASOS has the gall to make me wait 3-5 working days for an update on where the hell it is. I spent over £300 on this order which means I should have gotten next day delivery but ASOS doesn't care to rectify this straight away. They want to make me wait for this order for 3-5 working days! They have refused to send me a replacement. Funny thing is, I contacted them yesterday, when the package should have arrived, saying DPD has already told me they lost my parcel and 'Hollie' said contact us again after 10pm to make sure you don't get it when DPD had already confirmed to me that it was lost! They are lazy, slow and careless and as a regular customer, I'm shocked by their service."

I received an order today & I'm really happy with both the delivery & the items. I'm use asos for the 'curve' range which is excellent. I've always dreaded shopping for clothes, choice on the high street & online are poor & ive always ended up settling for stuff that I'm not entirely happy with. Asos offer good choice & quality that are actually fashionable unlike other stores with ranges for curvy girls. Nothing frumpy. Postage is free over £20 also which is a plus. I'd recommend to my friends, happily."

I asked CS which item was out, and they told me to replace my order because check out had technical issues. Well, they had already charged me for the order, so I ask for a refund. CSR claimed, then, that the order didn't go through because my card declined. I argued that I had paid with Paypal, and I see the charge on my statement.

I lodged a missing delivery and they said they would raise an investigation with DPD which could take 3 - 5 days, when I chased on day 6 I was told because I wasn't the account holder (me and my sister share an account) that they couldn't discuss it any further with me. Why it took them 6 days to realise this is beyond me and not my fault and the end of the day. So then my sister spoke with them and they said ""they would raise an investigation with DPD which could take 3 - 5 days"" to which I was outraged as I had already wait 6 days! They should resolve the clients issue first and deal with DPD separately, I should not be out of pocket and without my items because a delivery driver couldn't be bothered to do their job. I have shopped with them for years an have never had an issue to now, but it will stop me using them."

As soon as I receive the goods i'm sending them back for a refund as I don't need them anymore but even after telling them this they wont cancel the order. I understand they want to keep the sale but i have categorically told them they have lost it already, you would think they would then try to keep me happy.

That is a really bad service contract designed only with the retailer and courier in mind! When you contact customer service for an update they say it’s the courier company’s fault and the courier says it’s the contract they have with the retailer so to hell with the customer! They are more than happy to quote terms and conditions put in place to cover them and you can wait for your money back!

"November 02, 2017",1,Absolutely terrible customer service,"Absolutely terrible customer service. I ordered items to be delivered with 2 day express shipping. I never received them. No tracking information listed on my ASOS account. I contact customer service and they transfer me to their ‘delivery team’ tell me to wait 48 hours. I wait, nothing...I contact them again they transfer me AGAIN. Still nothing. At this point I’ve asked for a full refund, but I honestly don’t expect to get it. I have ordered with them in the past and never had issues. Not sure what changed, but I will never order another item from this company again."
"November 02, 2017",1,"late delivery, rude response, breaching consumer rights","Appalling customer service. Have paid for premier delivery so should receive orders next day if ordered before midnight. I placed an order at 10pm for delivery on the 31st. Order confirmation received late then informed it would be delivered a day late on 1st November. Contacted ASOS and was told by Sunni, that was wrong it would be with me on 31st. Guess what? Received order 1 day late. Contacted again and received the most insincere reply by Jenna, who refused to refund postage simply quoting T&C's. Again requested refund of delivery costs as they have breached contract and my rights are protected under consumer regs act. Also informed them my account would not be renewed when it expires next month and told them to collect this now unwanted late parcel. Claire has just responded again refusing refund or any other form of remedy and informing me how to return! Clearly they have so many customers they don't mind losing a few and given the other reviews regarding their premier account delivery they have already lost a decent amount. Wonder if they'll regret that when the next recession happens? As for me, starting the small claims process today, on principal this company should not be allowed to breach consumer rights and get away with it."

I contacted them again they said your package will come November 2 , so I called uPS and they said it was a lie ! You iteam was never shipped and so I emailed them extremely upset because I needed the outfit for an event , they said they needed to open an investigation because the package was lost . I was furious , I love shopping online and this was the WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE . I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER ITEAM FROM THIS WEBSITE AGAIN. If your reading because you really like something on the website please please don’t get it as much as you like it , it’s not worth it . If you want your money back as soon as possible contact your card customer service they will be sure to refund your money as soon as possible unlike ASOS who takes 30 days to give you a product and your money back ."

I corrected the error in my account and contacted  Asos regarding the error and the fact on the Hermes tracking page there was an issue with it. I was directed to Hermes, Hermes directed me to Asos - who basically said it's your fault and you'll eventually get a refund. All I tried to do was let Hermes and the courier know the error. Clearly there is no communication between the two. Won't order from Asos again."
"November 01, 2017",1,Appalling customer service,Appalling customer service. Call centre just end calls half way through speaking so you have to keep calling back. Their delivery company UPS claims to have delivered but haven’t. Can’t speak to the delivery company and just get fobbed off with a 48 hour rule for replying to you. Cant speak to any manager level person without waiting 24 hours. Cant get a refund processed for 48 hours. We used to use Asos a lot but we won’t order anything from them again after this.

I was told to wait until the 1st of November. Which I have done. Parcel has still not arrived. I have checked everywhere and my parcel is nowhere to be found. I asked for a refund and i get inundated with excuses and reasons to not give it to me. Now i have to wait another day to ""be sure"" and check with my neighbours etc and more timelines added that i have to adhere to. Dealing with Asos has been the most appalling service I have ever had. They are very happy to take your money but will avoid the subject of a refund as much as they possibly can. I will never order from asos again and i will make sure anyone I know doesn't either DO NOT order from Asos unless you are willing to give a limb for delivery fees to get so much as decent tracking information"

However, received no updates about it until 6pm, and said the order will be delivered tomorrow. WHAT IS THE POINT FOR PAYING THE PREMIER? Had the most annoying conversation with the customer service - SOPHIE! Rude, not answering questions, end the conversation without asking the customer ""is there anything else I can help with?""... Is that meant your customer service dept can do whatever they want to? Such as being rude to the customers. FYI: 10065448  (Sophie)"
"October 31, 2017",1,POOR SERVICE,I ordered a top last night and paid extra for next day delivery. I usually get an email confirmation but this time I didn't. I already felt weird about that but I checked my account and it says there that ny order is there and due to be delivered the next day. However around 12:30pm I still haven't got anything so I decided to contact their custoner service to shockingly find out that my order has been cancelled due to technical problem and YET I didn't receive an email or anything that it's been cancelled. I needed that top for today as it's for a gift to my friend and now I had to improvise and look for other gift just because of their system messed up. This kind of service is very unacceptable to think that asos is supposed to be a trusted website but NOT. I'm still waiting for my money that they took right away to be back in my account. I will NEVER ORDER FROM THIS WEBSITE AGAIN. POOR SERVICE!!

You need to invest in training your staff! they are useless!"

"October 27, 2017",1,Awful at resolving their mistakes,"I have been an ASOS customer for a good few years and always found them to be reliable and helpful until recently. I purchased a dress online for my girlfriend to attend a wedding in a few days time. Upon arrival it was the wrong dress sent that had a similar name on the website but a completely different fit, my girlfriend was understandably quite worried about the imminent event so I called customer services. They told me that they could not issue any sort of refund until I went to the post office and sent the item back, despite me explaining that I needed the correct item with a very quick turnaround, so I was told my only option was to re order the dress after being assured that it was highly unlikely for this sort of error to happen and I would need next day delivery. I ordered again and the item arrived the day before the wedding, unbelievably the wrong item again leaving my girlfriend with nothing to wear and me out of pocket twice. I called again and was told I would need to return another dress and all they offered for the trouble was a pathetic 15% discount that has a one month expiry. I will most likely not be using asos again, everything from the repeat issue with two consecutive orders to the company having absolutely no resolution to make my life easier has completely put me off. I also then had to rush around the shops the day before the wedding to find a replacement instead of enjoying the build up to the event. I think if you are purchasing clothing online there are more reputable and reliable services since this company's decline."

Every jacket I own is the same size, I ordered one recently and it was tiny. No problem I thought, they got it to me in a day so exchanging won't be an issue. I took it to the post office first thing the day after and have now been told it will take 7 w/d for them to process the return and another week for the replacement. Unless of course... I lend them another £80 to look after for a few weeks, even though I have the PO proof of postage. In that case, I can have the right one tomorrow. Won't be using them again.Also, why have online chat if they do nothing but copy and paste the FAQs!?"

Literally just now I got of a chat with the customer service help team and they didn’t offer any consideration or helpfulness or apology for the fact my order has not arrived and I have had no tracking information about why not or how it hasn’t left the sorting hub in four days from being despatched to them to only investigate and inform it they can’t help because it’s a postal delay and I have to wait an extra week!! I wanted my order for an event The next day I had ordered it with plenty of time to come for my event and it was expected to arrive a day ago and there was no apology or any suggestion of discount or free delivery next time only that they’d let the courier service know I’d like notification of postal delay next time. And they fact is even if I cancelled and returned the order I would have to wait over a week for a refund to be processed. I am so livid and this isn’t the only time they haven’t done anything to resolve the situation or make me happier about a situation they caused from being an informative useless company with no customer sympathy and awful service. Last time I returned soemthing because it was the wrong size and requested a new size only to get an automated email saying a refund was being processed so I had to contact and find out the size I wanted was out fo stock and rather than them putting on hold the size when it is back in stock and sending it out suggest I buy something different in there end of season sale which I did not want."

I contacted customer services and they would investigate and send out a new order. That investigation never happened and nothing was sent. Then I contacted asos again a week later and after an hour on the chat the finally offered to reorder and sent it with next working day delivery (international/Europe). The whole chat was a pretty bad experience. After that I was pretty fed up, but then I was going on a trip and I wanted some dresses from the tall section. So my order in October. Again not delivered. Tried customer services again. Very unhelpful. It's Monday today and I'm leaving Friday. All she offered was - a 48h investigation and send out a replacement after that (which wouldn't arrive in time)- Cancel the order and I reorder again and they give me free next day delivery (I used a sale discount code which was not available anymore so I'd end up paying more for my order). On top of that it would take them 5-10 working days to refund the original order. It was quite a large order so nice sum for Asos to be sitting on twice. - Cancel the order. I asked to speak to a manager. The customer service rep Molly was pretty unsympathetic, didn't even respond to half my concerns and then ended the chat abruptly. Save to say I'll now think 3 times before ordering from Asos again. I'm really fed up to be honest. And incredibly frustrated. I used to be a big, big asos fan. But their customer services really lets them down."

"October 20, 2017",1,Don't buy from ASOS,"I ordered 3 items and bought premier shipping. I needed the clothes the next day after it was supposed to arrive. On the day it was supposed to arrive it didn't show up. I was mad because I actually need these clothes. I DM them on twitter. They got back to me and said 'we'll send you an email when your parcel has shipped.' The next day they send a DM saying my order was not successful even though my card was charged the full amount days earlier. Very disappointing. If you need clothing by a specific day, don't buy from ASOS."

Customer service were fine in dealing with a refund, but then i had to go through the hassle of printing the form out, getting to the post office etc. Nothing but inconvenience for me."
"October 20, 2017",1,Horrible customer service,"I have never experienced such bad service. They have used an un-reliable courier company who shipped my package back to the UK without my consent. The customer service team told me to track it down myself. No apologies or even store credit was offered as compensation (not that i'd use ASOS again) I have never had such little help from there customer service team. I would highly recommend using any other fashion brand. Like literally, any other brand. Now something I required for an event tomorrow will not be here. Thanks for nothing ASOS.

I mean take a look of the rating from costumers, excellent and great gets = 43% while Poor and bad gets = 51% and Average = 5%. Thats a coin flip in THEIR favour. I ordered simple sweaters, and with just few quantity aswell. (2 pieces) I was supposed to get them 27th September, never got it. I've been in contact with the costumer service trough email, the package is lost, or so they say (bet they never had it in stock), so they sent a replacement. I was supposed to get it 19 October (the same 2 pieces) Still don't have it. For anyone who's reading, don't take your chances with it. Did i mention i'm basically UK's nabour-country? So the fact that i still haven't got my package is beyond me."

"October 18, 2017",1,Asos customer service - Disgrace,"absolutely shocking - Remember when asos used to be great. Gradually got worse over the years, been a premier customer for at least the last 5 years. Ordered item next day delivery usually comes with DPD and comes to my place of work, so they decide to send with UK Mail who give me a nighttime slot of 6pm - 10pm. So i thought open a chat, well the girl who was on the chat was rude had a poor attitude and tried to cut me off. Asked her for her full name she refused, i asked her numerous times can she liase with UK Mail to have the address changed which she told me no plenty of times. Its basically tough luck and when the same happens the next day and i am not present for this 4 hour window when my parcel will come that it will go back to there warehouse, i couldn't see how this helped me in any way and i was very patient with the girl, Raquel her name was. Further down the chat she tried to cut me off and close the chat window, very abrupt and rude. She then advising ASOS can liase with UK Mail however that i need to close the chat and email them, when i asked for a email she refused to give me one, I have kept a transcript and will be making a complaint to asos. The rep even told me no advisor would tell me any different, she was not even willing to try and help. So the lesson is if you try and anticipate the delivery like me and have it delivered to your work, then they send it out with a second rate courier that their hands our tied, dont contact them because its too much hassle for these 'advisors'. Asked for a refund and was ignored despite them being able to recall this from the courier, asked for a email address to complain - refusedI literally am furious at the treatment by this rep and hope she is reprimanded. Still dont know how i am meant to get my order or a refund?"

I got a size 8 they are very true to size and fit very comfortably would definitely recommend them 100% by far best boots I’ve ordered and I’ve ordered a lot !!

Hermes pretended to deliver my parcel when I had been in waiting for it for two days and then told me to contact ASOS and then they couldn't do anything about it. Most unreliable, shocking service ever. Never using them again."
"October 17, 2017",1,Quality of this company has seriously declined,"ASOS has repeatedly sent me the wrong size. I ordered boots in a US size 6 (UK size 4/euro size 37). When my package arrived, I was surprised to find boots in US size 7 (UK size 5/euro size 38). I wanted to make it work, but the boots were much too loose. I understand mistakes happen, so I got in touch with customer service and was offered free express shipping for the trouble and I immediately sent back the wrong pair. 2 days later, the “corrected” pair of boots arrived. I was shocked to find that they were again US size 7. I contacted ASOS for a second time asking for a correct exchange. The customer service rep told me not to bother with another exchange to ensure that I don’t receive the wrong size again. Outrageous! All I wanted were the boots in the correct size. I did not want to return for a refund. I could not believe that I received such a response. What kind of company would prefer to lose a sale rather than correct the order? They also asked for proof that I did select a US size 6 in my order so I provided screenshots. I was told they'd be conducting a 48-hour investigation and would get back to me. Once they got back to me, the boots had sold out online and I received a message stating they would be unable to complete an exchange. They offered me a 20% off discount code that expires in one month. I am disappointed to see that the quality of ASOS has seriously declined. I won’t be ordering from ASOS again. It took an entire month for the return/refund process to finalize."

"October 17, 2017",1,Montel is useless,"I went onto chat to get a better understanding of what size to buy in slippers as there was nothing to help on the website and the operator I was talking to advised a medium for a size 7 so I ordered them and they where too small so I sent them back for a bigger size, No big deal, and then I get an email to tell me i have been refunded cus all sizes are now out of stock but I go on and all sizes are in stock so i hop back onto chat to Montel for some help and he tells me a replacement has been sent out to me in size medium again!! Then proceeds to tell me that the size I asked for was sent. This operator obviously has not got a clue what is going on. I've now tried a different method of communication to see if I can get better clarification of what is actually going on."
"October 16, 2017",5,My favorite place to shop online,"Shopped there a lot, their things look almost exactly in person as it does online, delivery is fast and reliable, quality is good and prices are great. Have no problems recommending them to someone else"
"October 16, 2017",1,Still waiting on items or refund after 3 weeks,"I ordered 5 items from ASOS and only 2 arrived. The remaining 3 have still not arrived and despite 4 emails to their customer care team - I have not yet had a response, the items or a refund.Poor customer service"
"October 16, 2017",1,BAD EXPERIENCE WITH ASOS,"They have misleading information on the website, where it says 100% Cotton, most probably the real product doesn't have 100% Cotton, beware of this!Also, the refund system it's terrible!"
"October 16, 2017",1,"their customer service and delivery service is totally unreliable, do not have any thing to do with this company!!!","I order 2 pairs of socks from Asos, and as I have recently moved I forgot to change my address details to the new address, fair enough, so I had a chat with their customer service the next day after the order was made explaining my situation, after much persuasion I was told a replacement delivery would be delivered to my new address as soon as I updated my address on their site, which I did but I never received the replacement item either as I was told that it was signed for and collected by someone but that was as far as Asos customer service could help.So I order the same product again, this means i have been charged twice for the same product, and so I ordered it to my work place, and i was told this was delivered on friday 13-10-17 but i did not receive it. It is not yet christmas and Asos can not even manage to deliver 2 pairs of socks, this company is a joke and their customer service and delivery service is totally unreliable, do not have any thing to do with this company!!!"
"October 16, 2017",1,Bad customer service,"I have ordered from Asos.com about three times. Overall, clothing is good and at first everything was okay. In my last order, I had ordered shoes which came with crooked heels and I returnd the whole order. After the refund time expired, I contacted the customer service to ask what is going on with the refund. Now, a month later and 4 contacts with them, I was told I will get an update (not refund) within 3-5 working days... a promise which I am hearing for forth time without getting any update... I am very very disappointed..."

"October 14, 2017",1,asos refuses to give me my correct refund.,"This company is a joke!! Liars, thieves!! I bought 13 items spent over $350 and was excited to use their promo ""spend more save more"" $50 off $200 or $100 off $300 so that's what I did. I spent $352. Got $100 off making my total $252.  Awesome right!! So we get our stuff, and only have to return 4 items pretty good. So I am waiting forever for my return 2 weeks, finally get it WHAT!!!!  The 4 items I returned totaled $137.50  so here's where the truth of this company comes out, they take the entire $100 I saved on my entire purchase out of that $137.50 refunding me a wopping  $37.50.  Some dishonesty right there!!!  Stealing my money!!! So I start emailing them no response. I'm going over their return policy says nothing of the sort that this is the way they do returns.  So I finally get an email back they could care less, they say because I got that $100 off of my purchase they took it back. I'm like WAIT I still spent $214.50 so should still receive  $50 off  my purchase, then taking $50 off the $137.50 making my true and honest retund $87.50. So they owe me $49.50 I understand thats not a lot of money, that is not the point. Take care of your customers! Be an honest company!!! UMM dont steal money!! I keep e-mailing them,THEY just fight me and argue. I sent proof of their promotion they have all the order history. They just want to steal from me!!!  They sent an email asking if i was satisfied with customer service i said NO WAY and sent it, it came right back as failure to send no response. FRAUD!!!!  LIARS!!! THIEVES!!! DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE!!! THERE ARE HONEST COMPANIES THAT TAKE CARE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS!!!  STEALING MONEY WHAT A JOKE!!! HOW MANY OTHERS HAVE HAD THIS HAPPEN AND DIDN'T CATCH IT OR DIDN'T FIGHT IT!!!!   ASOS  IS A HORRIBLE COMPANY!!!!  I WILL SPREAD THIS ALL OVER SOCIAL MEDIA FOREVER!!!!! 💩👎🖓👎🖓💩"
"October 13, 2017",1,I didn't listen to the reviews,"I didn't listen to the reviews. I should have listened to the reviews. Ordered two items from the site, and waited two weeks passed the delivery date before checking in with customer service. When I asked where my package was, they told me that they will open an investigation. The next day I got an email saying that they have received my return, even though I never asked for a return. Really terrible service."
"October 13, 2017",1,Don't always deliver with 2 day shipping,"I had ordered a skirt for an occasion, payed the extra $12 for 2 day shipping and it was going to end up being delivered to me a week after I had ordered it. I use to love ASOS, but this upset me since I had trusted that they would get it to me within 2 days. Now I don't have an outfit to wear for my special occasion."

They took a long time to respond to my email that they had sent the wrong size, and then they sent the wrong one again! The staff was unhelpful throughout. Sending back my second pair of shoes... I'd avoid this company if you can."
"October 11, 2017",1,So ive ordered a big order,"So ive ordered a big order, they emailed me in the morning before my delivery that woops we are out of stock of your pants, after i paid for them, so after that i was like whatever i will order new ones, they emailed me again saying they will notify me when they will be near, and will give me a one hour time slot to be ready to collect my delivery so because i havent received that i though ok i will change my delivery adress just down the street to the pharmacy so i could go to work, after literally 10minutes i get an email that they will deliver my parcelvto the pharmacy the next day, why? Turns out the dpd tried, an i cannot stress this enough TRIED to deliver the parcel to the pharmacy but they failed hahaha, so lets figure this out they would of notifed me if they were near with a mesage thats says in the next hour the parcel will be with me, but they didnt, but they were in the pharmacy and deliver the parcel but somehow failed. Yeah i know what a load of bs. Anyway so yeah if you want to spend 200£ get a message that your pants that was suppost to be with a suit are out of stock on the morning of the deliver day and then get your parcel deliver the next day not this day when it was suppostu then suuuuurreee go ahead use asos. Oh yeah almost forgot i contacted the customer service guess what my options are to wait for the parcel or get a refund that will take up to two weeks!! How nice is that hahaha and you know why it will take this long,ill tell you kids sit down, well you see they need to get the clothes from dpd and then they can start my refund, so the jorney from dpd to asos warehouse they said would take about 4 days but somehow they delivered mine in 1 funny huh? So yeah if you want to waste your time and money go ahead."
"October 11, 2017",1,I bought one pair of shoes last year it …,I bought one pair of shoes last year it was one size small from my size then I ordered another pair and gave back the pair to ASOS which was small in size. It's more than a year I didn't get back my money ($120) talk with them they said you will get your money in seven working days. It's been 15 months now very disappointed with that.
"October 10, 2017",3,DPD is ruining Asos,This is going to be a bit of a mixed review here as I like Asos but I have a serious issue with Asos’s delivery partner DPD.I pay extra for next day delivery charges to Asos as a Asos prime customer but I never seem to get it the next with DPD their delivery providers.DPD is the most unreliable and unprofessional delivery company I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with and it is for that reason that I don’t give ASOS  5stars.I have raised many complaints about DPD both directly to Asos and dpd themselves.DPD is rapidly deminising my interest in Asos.
"October 10, 2017",5,Great service and product selection.,Great service and product selection. They had the dress 👗 I was looking for in stock!
"October 10, 2017",5,Love Asos,Love Asos. Never had a problem and my deliveries always arrive on time.
"October 10, 2017",1,Do not use this sham of a company,"Do not use this sham of a company. I ordered stuff for next day delivery it did not come. Then I contacted the customer service and she said I will look into it. I checked again that day and she had cancelled my order. Another rep said all they could do was refund me I said fine and went and ordered my stuff elsewhere. 2 days after my stuff arrived from the other company I switched to I contacted asos again to know where was my refund. She basically told Me to  put up or shut up and that it would take a week for them to get the stuff back in their possession. A further 2 days later I got an email to go and collect my order , this after being told at least twice that I wasn't getting it and I would be refunded. The customer service do not keep a record of your correspondence with them so every time you contact them you have to start from the start again. You can imagine how frustrating that is after nearly a week of it's coming/ it's not/ we refund you/ we don't refund you/ now here's your order"
"October 09, 2017",4,"ASOS regular shopper, very few issues","I have shopped with ASOS for years, very surprised to see such negative reviews. I have had a few issues and as their customer care contact is via email only, this hasn't proven to be so efficient and can be quite difficult which is why I knocked a star off.  BUT, considering the amount of orders I place, my experiences have been positive and I consider ASOS my number 1 marketplace.Next Day delivery is £10 for a year - BARGAIN. I can order at 11pm and my order be with me 9am the next morning.  Impressive and I've never had an issue with DPD deliveries.  I always know where my parcel is and when its arriving. If I won't be in, I arrange for it to be delivered to my shed and I really do get value for my £10.Returns policy - very, very easy process.  I spend thousands per year, my return rate is low but when I have sent things back, I have never had a discrepancy or any issue with the money being refunded.Great variety of products with good range of prices, great delivery and returns process, good rewards scheme for customers......very happy shopper here!"
"October 09, 2017",1,DO NOT SHIP INTERNATIONALLY WITH ASOS!,"DO NOT SHIP INTERNATIONALLY WITH ASOS!I buy from many international websites that ship to Israel. ASOS has the worst experience for international shipping to IL I have ever encountered!!! If I don't use express shipping, I need to pick my package up from an old, dusty convenience store in a shady street in my city (why?????). If I order packages that exceed my local customs limit ASOS used the worst company to handle customs. The company is called GCX, they are incredibly slow! I ordered a package a week ago, paid for express shipping and was just notified the package will not arrive for another week. That's 2 weeks for ""express shipping"". In addition, on top of the customs fees (which I am more than prepared to pay), GCX charges a handling fee of 12.5 GBP!!!! No other company does that!!!!I paid a total of 22.5 GBP just to get the package over to me with extremely delayed shipping. BAD BAD experience by all means. PS - contacted ASOS about this many times but they won't take any responsibility."
"October 08, 2017",1,ZERO stars.,"ZERO stars.My parcel has gone missing and all customer services said was to check with the neighbours as they are unable to contact the couriers. Shameful behaviour from customer services. Don't shop at ASOS, once they have you money they won't help you."
"October 07, 2017",1,downhill service...,I always shop at ASOS but recently it has been nonsense ever since DPD took over. They have delivered my parcel else where and I have checked with neighbours etc and no where to be seen. As usual they are so confused via email and so generic(kept to script) I want a refund for items I did not receive yet they keep telling me no as DPD need to investigate etc. I've shopped there for years with no hassle no issues so why would I all of a sudden make this up? I needed the items for a holiday and relied on my A list next day delivery etc. but nope having issues this week which I was not informed about until I asked multiple times why my other orders are arriving 4 days later. Not happy and this is still ongoing. They're sitting on my money which I could use elsewhere or even on my holiday! So be careful because ASOS is not what they used to be.
"October 07, 2017",1,If I could give No stars I would.,If I could give No stars I would.. Asos seriously needs to look at it's customer service and address it as this dealing with this company has been one of the worst experiences I have ever had.. Placed order which qualified for next day the next day arrives no order so check and say not going to be dispatched for another 6 days called to cancel order was told they couldn't cancel order and would have to put us a specialist team that would contact us in 5-7 working days so I asked to talk to s manager as this is not acceptable and was told I couldn't and one would contact me within 24hrs now it's been more than 24hrs no contact no order and no refund so if you want to be treated as a valued customer spend your money elsewhere as this company have no idea how to look after and keep customers..
"October 07, 2017",1,Wish I could leave 0 stars.,"Wish I could leave 0 stars.Paid for next day delievery for a reason! Waited for my item to be delievered and get a message saying I was out, opened the image from DPD and they weren’t even at the right house! Checked my address and it was correct. Spent atleast an hour waiting on the phone to get through to someone whilst being charged.Worst customer service ever! Should be ashamed!"
"October 07, 2017",1,I was sent promotion code for 20% off …,"I was sent promotion code for 20% off for my Birthday from them. So I spent an hour looking for items and once I was finished I checked out, only to find that code was not excepted. This was a loss of £14, but I checked out as I thought the customer service advisor would be able to amend. No help from Paul or Charlie the advisors who thought my best option was to go to Flannels, and return the order to Asos. Have I gone mad! Please ignore all promotions from ASOS by email. Sorry got to go to Flannels and get my 10% discount which will work. I’ve have been on the phone to Asos customers service for over an hour trying to get this problem rectified as my delivery note is unreadable for return. The next two advisors said there is nothing they do as they have no way of resending out delivery notes. My only options are to keep the delivery and lose the discount or to pay myself for a return through Royal Mail, which is a total joke. There is NO HELP! Guess what? After waiting a couple more days after my many phone calls of complaint, I retried the 20% off code on a much smaller amount and it worked. So I guess that you can have a 20% Birthday Discount as long as it doesn’t cost them to much money. Just beware please as when it does go wrong, they will not be willing help you. I had to keep my order without the discount, as they can’t or won’t resend out a copy of your order form. This was a loss to me of £14 but a massive learning curve in Asos life. Plus through their advisors I’ve discovers Flannels a utopia of fashion, with much bigger names and even bigger discounts. Thanks Asos!"
"October 06, 2017",1,DPD & ASOS: Match made in hell,"Never been treated so poorly as a customer. I'm not exactly a bid reviewer, but making the exception! DPD are an absolute joke and they're sadly destroying the reputation of the companies who use them including, in this case, ASOS. Waited in, only to get a message telling me that unfortunately I was out. No no, took the afternoon off work and waited like I had nothing better to do. Complain to ASOS, only to be informed that the driver had typed a note to say he made an attempt to deliver, and left a card outside the black door. Outright lies, I don't even have a black door! Poor on DPD for hiring the most untrustworthy of drivers, Poor on ASOS for trusting their word. Paid extra for next day delivery for a reason, and as a result of the driver's lies, now cannot claim that money back because of ""policy"". Never been so angry, total principals, won't be using either again.Not even a gesture to pay the delivery charge back which is possibly the most insulting of it all. Nothing you could do? Nothing? Great policy guys. To top it off, the guy on the online help service ends the chat before any resolution...?! I'll go spend my money elsewhere on more reliable services 👋🏼"

"October 05, 2017",1,Appalling Customer Service,"Appalling customer service! I have shopped at ASOS for YEARS (from two different countries) and everything used to be great - easy enough return process etc. UNTIL something goes wrong. Doesn't matter if you are and A-List shopper on their site. I specifically needed something next day for an event and was going to pay the £6, but decided I shop there all the time so may as well finally pay the £10 to get a year of next day deliveries. The next day I get an email from DPD scheduling my delivery for the following day (so a day late). Obviously unhappy and going to have scramble to get something else for my event, I chat to 'Louie' on their online chat portal. He openly admitted that it was their fault and they had several packages delayed a day but would not give me any sort of credit. So even when I return the item since it won't arrive in time - I'm out £10! I no longer need the next day delivery because I refuse to ever shop with them again!! Absolute joke of customer service and they have officially lost a long time and frequent customer. I work for a similar e-commerce website and we would NEVER lose a customer or let them walk away feeling like this. They need to reevaluate their business strategy."
"October 05, 2017",1,WOW.,"Used to LOVE ASOS, but now. WOW, words fail me. Their customer service attitudes are completely unacceptable, they are so rude. They have accused me of lying regarding my order. Completely missing the point that I pay for ASOS premier delivery for a year, I am an A-list shopper on their website. They still believe they are in the right. I am utterly disgusted in the way they treat their customers. This is not the first time that I have encountered issues with ASOS customer care team. This final experience has put me off shopping with them."
"October 05, 2017",5,I love ASOS,"I love ASOS.  Have ordered 3x (2 were skincare and 1 Barney's leather jacket).  Their delivery to UAE (Dubai) is so fast, normally reaches me on the 3rd day of order - on standard delivery option.  The jacket i ordered was faulty at the back and have to request for a replacement,  the customer care (Georgina) helped me with the free return procedure via aramex and the replacement was received 3 days earlier than promised.  It was a smooth process and frankly was so surprised with all the bad comments and reviews.  All the customer care replied within the day and have action my request promptly.Kudos to the Asos team!"
"October 04, 2017",5,So shocked by so much negative reviews,"ASOS is my first choice when ordering, have had ASOS premier for about 4 years in a row. I have never had a bad experience with them yet. One time I ordered a jacket (Boohoo branded) and the zip broke, as they were out of stock they actually paid for me to get the jacket zip fixed! Love, love, LOVE ASOS!My only suggestion is they should carry more plus size clothing from New Look, Boohoo etc..."

"October 04, 2017",1,DISGUSTING SERVICE - LOST ITEMS NO REFUND!,"Right so, Asos lost my parcel. It took me a week, for them to even LOOK into it. Because of this I contacted royal mail myself who confirmed it was lost. Asos now wont refund  me because they can't contact royal mail, they wont do anything. just they are ''looking into it''. I spoke on the online chat and they were no help, i did better investigating than their team.I am £73 out of pocket with no items, i am furious beyond belief. Disgusting after customer service and disgusting service. How can they let a customer be short of pocket?"

There is no customer service. There's no treatment of you as a human being / person. Its all technical procedures which quite frankly work awfully. Agents are rude, unhelpful and have no proactive ability. No response to emails when escalated higher. Its just terrible."

"October 03, 2017",1,I bought from ASOS twice and always …,"I bought from ASOS twice and always have had issues with delivery. First time I bought something from them, it was supposed to be delivered before the 23rd of December and I get a card from the post office to pick up my parcel on the 8th of January. I didn't really mind because it was Christmas season and so on and delivery usually gets delayed around that time. This time, I bought stuff on the 30th of August and get a mail that the items have been shipped on the 4th of September and that I should be getting them by 15th of September and it's 3rd of October and I am still waiting. Customer care just keeps sending me those generic mails about checking if the postman dropped it in the bin or something like that. They aren't very helpful and they do not tell you if they will refund or reship. I am not buying anything again from them. I am very disappointed."
"October 02, 2017",1,Just shop somewhere else,"They do not tell you about any import charges and instead tell you that international delivery is free. The import charges are over half the value of the coat I purchased. They are less than helpful when you complain to them. Worst company, will never purchase from them again."
"October 02, 2017",5,Thanks,"Thanks, Asos, for existing"
"October 02, 2017",1,NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ALL!,"Been an ASOS premier customer for a few years and more often than not the next day deliveries are delayed. This happened AGAIN a few days ago where my items were sitting at the depot an hour away from where I live since 8.45 that morning. I never received an email until 4.30 that afternoon to tell me its delayed and will now be delivered 3 days later. These were items specifically needed for an event that night. After 45 minutes trying to contact their customer support (which I couldn't) I managed to get through to the delivery service who had absolutely no answers! ""Its just been delayed, we don't know why."" was the exact response. I explained that I had been waiting since 9am and live an hour away. Why couldn't they contact me earlier and I could have picked the items up myself - again met with a verbal shrug of the shoulders. Ridiculous. I left a message with ASOS customer service on Facebook and have now had 3 replies from 3 different advisors and judging by their response, not one has even bothered to read the complaint. A copy and paste ""Sorry here's 10 percent off your next order"" is all i received. I would say it's bad customer service but I have yet to receive anything remotely close to customer service. I also still do not have my items.Update: Items arrived 4 days late. Have now spoken to 6 separate advisors all of whom have completely ignored any of my questions and refused to take responsibility for the disgusting customer service I have received. Their last response was ""Sorry you don't want the items anymore you can return them for a full refund"". Absolutely shocking service and will not be using again!Update: Now 2 weeks and just been contacted by 'customer care' email after speaking to 12 advisors. One of which even lied to me about how many orders I had made so that they didn't need to refund me (which they still haven't). Still no further forward."
"October 02, 2017",1,"It would be oh so nice to see the items …on normal human being, worn normally.","It would be oh so nice to see the items sold how they're actually worn, you know, by normal people and not hipsters wearing a size too small. All over equality but not every guy that shops with you look like an ex-con  TGI Fridays line cook with neck tattoos, roid induced muscles, neck tattoos and terrible haircut. What happened to normal clothes? The female models all look like they could get a normal job."

Will never order again oh and have ordered before and the quality of the clothes are poor as well!!! Very disappointed and will be contacting company to get refund for 2 day shipping!!!
"September 30, 2017",4,Good!,"I spent £160 on Asos and got 6 clothing items plus a bag. They were all the Asos brand except for one blouse, which was from Pimkie. Surprisingly, I love all the items! I got all the items in either UK size 8 or 10, and they all fit nicely. Package arrived one day later than expected, but I won't blame Asos for that since I live in Finland and the post here can be slow sometimes. The delivery from the UK to Finland took 8 days. I think the quality is good for the price. Obviously Asos isn't as cheap as some other online stores, but you get what you pay for. I think the Asos brand is great for pretty basic, but nice good quality clothing. Of course they sell other brands and designer items as well, and the selection is big. Overall, I'm happy with my items and will probably purchase from Asos again!"
"September 29, 2017",2,My first time and lest.,"I ordered from their website the first time and it will be my last time ever. My order was for an upcoming event but now I have to figure something out, very soon. When they shipped my items, they only have my address as ""Conshohocken, PA"" USA. That is it. Nobody from their warehouse realized the error and I wasn't informed. When they shipped to USA, nobody can find my location and the tracking system is so slow. When ups finally gave me the update about my packege not been able to deliver, it was too late for me to give them my address because they already sent it back. When I contact the ASOS customer service, they said is because nobody answer for the delivery so they can't deliver. Of course they can't.

"September 28, 2017",1,Terrible Customer experience and Lack of Care,"Terrible customer experience as I was expecting my products to arrive for an event and it did not! As a matter of fact, I spoke with Zehn from customer suppert and he actually told me to wait an extra 2 weeks (oct 14th) for the items to arrive. Did not fix the issue. Not a proper apology. Nothing. Never again"
"September 28, 2017",1,Lack of communication & left with nothing to wear for a special occasion,Ordered a maternity dress for a special occasion.  It arrived with a faulty zip so I returned it for an exchange.  I spoke to somebody at Asos on the Monday & explained I needed the replacement by Saturday.  She said she would issue a replacement immediately.  Thursday I received an email informing me that my account has been refunded.  I spoke to Asos & they explained that they are now out of stock but they haven't bothered to let me know in the meantime.  I now have 1 day to try to source a replacement maternity ball dress ... not an easy task.  Terrible communication & service by Asos.  Will not be using again!
"September 28, 2017",1,No contact? For Real??,"I would rate it 0 or negative. The product I received are total different than what I've ordered. The entire website doesn't have any contact information, not by email, phone or any method."
"September 27, 2017",1,Pointless Customer Service (no human to speak or write to!),"I ordered a skirt and some trousers at the start of September.  I kept the skirt but the trousers were so small I returned them by their Royal Mail Returns Service.  However, 2 weeks later I had had no correspondence from them to confirm receipt or refund so decided to contact them.  This is where the fun starts as it appears from their website that you are unable to contact Customer Service by phone - only live chat, email or social media.  I'm not on social media and their email didn't work so that left only live chat.  Fine if the Customer Service was able to solve my problem but they said they couldn't.  So I messaged to ask if they'd received my parcel and wanted to know when I could expect the refund (Royal Mail tracking said it had been received).  I was unable to provide the order number to Customer Services as the order receipt had been returned with the parcel, the confirmation email had been deleted from my email account and for some odd reason the order wasn't showing in my ASOS account history (why?).  So basically I was told that they couldn't help me without the order number.  I told her my address, telephone number, what and when I'd placed the order, how I'd paid for it but no - she couldn't help me without the order number.  So I asked what I should do and was told that because of data protection she couldn't help me any further.  I asked for their Head Office address so I could write to them and was told that she couldn't provide this because of security(?!).  So I asked for the Customer Service address but she was also unable to provide this because of security.  I mean what the?!  So what I supposed to do?  No-one to speak to, no-one to write to? So I went on-line and found these addresses myself but left the conversation fuming.  Fortunately, today I have since noticed that my card has now been refunded but the lack of communication after sending the item back and the lack of being able to sort out my simple problem via live chat (only option) has dum-founded me.  Having only made 2 purchases from ASOS in the past this will be my last."
"September 27, 2017",1,Terrible Customer Service,"I paid for next day delivery and the parcel didn't arrive. I checked the DPD tracking and it said that my parcel had been delivered and signed for, which it hadn't. I then contacted ASOS asking them where my parcel was. They said it would take up to 48 hours to get a reply from DPD, so I said this was unacceptable and asked for a refund on the 1 day delivery that I selected as I paid for a service that wasn't provided, they refused. They then proceded to end the chat before I could reply so now I have to wait for them to contact me. I won't be using ASOS again as they have terrible customer service."
"September 27, 2017",1,The  WORST customer service I've ever …,"The  WORST customer service I've ever experienced...I don't even want to explain how much I was struggling with ""customer"" service to get what I ordered and paid for... they made a series of mistakes and lied to me over chat and i had to take care of their irresponsibility!!!bunch of lazy idiots and thieves working there...I shouldn't be so rude, but this what they represent deserves nothing more..."

Essentially, customer service told me that all I can do is wait to see if the order arrives. There was no point in contacting their help center which one can only do by live chat or FB or other social media services. There is no person to talk to on the telephone!! A call center with trained employees and a good system would help EVERYONE! As is, the customer service employee comes off rude and uncaring and the customer is left frustrated and unhappy.Buyer beware that customer service is AWFUL!!!"

I've proved to them that I have sent my parcel back with proof of delivery and they're response is.. we haven't received the parcel back to our warehouse yet. It's a shamble!!!!! No one knows what they are doing, customer service is just appalling. One last thing, don't bother on paying £10 a year for free next day delivery! I'm still waiting on an order I ordered 4 days ago, even though I pay for next day delivery!! I'm absolutely fuming and it doesn't get any better. Don't waste your money; buy elsewhere."

I realised that I hadn't received my refund six weeks later. After seven emails to their customer care and a trip back to the parcel shop I eventually received a refund on 22 September. Asos gave me a scant apology, no explanation as to the six week delay and no goodwill compensation for my seven emails and extra trip to the parcel shop. I will never order from Asos again, their customer service is truly appalling."

I took the risk bought $400 worth of clothes held my breath and hoped for the best. Everything was on time. Received in 2 days (no joke,how are they that fast?) perfect condition exactly what I wanted. I was very impressed with this company.

I also taked to four of the staff members online they all seemed to say 'oh I'm sorry' and 'I'll just go and talk to my manager' not happy one lady called Vanessa rudely left me waiting for 10 minutes and 30 seconds, without saying a word I had to end the call in then end. Don't order if you want a stress free ride, to put it frank 'crap'"

I was tryna get my friend a birthday present, so I figured I'd wait for the refund and order again. The second time, the tracking ID provided was for a product from Amazon, and yet again, the package had been returned to ASOS. Returned twice, no refunds whatsoever. I'm out 76 pounds. There was nothing wrong with the delivery address provided since it was for the University of Liechtenstein. It's practically a landmark! And customer service for ASOS is a joke. Poppy was quick to blame me. Nikki made me wait a good 20 minutes and didn't respond.I would strongly discourage anyone placing international delivery orders from doing so."

Two weeks after the expected delivery date I contacted ASOS to see where they were and was informed ""still in the warehouse"". Given we were staying in the venue I requested they deliver them there and was assured next day delivery to the venue, for which I provided an address. A week later, at 8pm on the day of the wedding, the ties were delivered to my home address 300 miles from the venue. Offered a refund if I posted them back at my own expense, and 10% off a purchase in the next month. Very unhappy with the service, and only an email to complain via. No phone line to speak to anyone. Would avoid."

No way of speaking to them, can't write in..used live chat but they told me I had to go to a tailor, get a quote on headed paper and then they MAY agree to the costs of repair. Absolutely awful service. I asked to escalate it but there is NO COMPLAINTS PROCEDURE. I was told all complaints are resolved within chat. I asked to write in and was told the address was on their website, it's not. I asked for the link to the web address with this address, I was sent to their help page and the chat handler then left the chat. ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!"
"September 18, 2017",1,The worst company I've ever dealt with.,"Absolutely atrocious costumer service. Impossible to get a hold of, takes hours to get responses via live chat, months to get a refund.I ordered size 18 pants and got size 4. Size. 4. I ask them if they can send me the correct order, only to be met with ""it's out of stock"" even though the product is still on their website. When I relay this to them, I receive the same e-mail 4 times, which is basically just a copy-paste of the first one I received. They kept prompting me to send back the pants - and I did - but at the current time I wish I kept them and sold them myself. Absolutely terrible. Avoid buying from Asos if you value your time, money and sanity."
"September 18, 2017",1,Do yourself a favor and avoid buying from Asos,"After order has not been delivered, Asos has the nerve to tell me to check behind bins, a shed, garage or porch because the driver might have left it there. i have never received a single email confirming delivery but now that i'm inquiring about it they come up with all these stupid ideas. I have actually given up on my order, its really not worth it."
"September 17, 2017",3,Mixed reviews - it's not all bad,Mixed reviews for me. I'm an ASOS Prime customer but have had issues with deliveries. I think it's courier they use more than ASOS so I've given them 3 stars. Very quick to respond via twitter so help is available. I did have an order go missing which I believe the courier himself signed for as I was at work and I still got charged. Took me about a month but I managed to get my money back - they even disputed when my card company got involved. Since then I haven't had many problems but ASOS have a way to go to get five stars. I also arranged a refund of an item that the courier didn't deliver - oddly enough he turned up the next day. I don't believe Prime always comes through...yet ASOS don't compensate. I'll still use the site as there are companies that are worse.

This Asos company Stinks for doing something like that to me."

If this was my business and the mistake was on my side I would move mountains to keep the customer, and if all they asked was for a £2 reduction on the order so they can get next day delivery I would have gladly offered it. In fact I would have offered before being asked. I will never shop with ASOS again"
"September 13, 2017",1,for your own sanity avoid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"without a doubt one of the most frustrating companies to deal with, can only email or chat online, if you enjoy dealing with idiots who take 5 minutes between each piece of conversation then get on ASOS chat, it will literally blow the head off you how frustrating it can be to do a simple returnquite simply, avoid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"September 13, 2017",1,I will never purchase from ASOS again.,"I placed an order with ASOS for next day delivery. I didn't receive a confirmation email which I thought was odd but I received a confirmation for my payment from PayPal so I assumed all is good. However, the next day when I was supposed to receive my package (Between 7am and 10pm) I waited all day for a despatch email that never came. By 7pm I was agitated and went to the website to find answers. There is no number to call which is frustrating (I was later told they don't have a call centre) so their only means of half decent contact is through a Facebook chat or a live help chat on their website. Generally I have good experiences with live chats so decided to take that route. However I waited around 30 minutes for someone to become available. Every message I sent I had to wait 10 minutes for a reply to, and in the end they told me they couldn't find my account OR my order on their system!! If that wasn't frustrating enough they told me I had to wait within a 48 hour time frame for someone to get back to me! I then decided to go to the Facebook chat where within 15 hours the only response I received ""Are you sure the email you provided is correct?"". So I took to the live chat once again, where I waited another 30 minutes to be spoken to who took even LONGER to reply than the last time for them to tell me the exact same thing the first person told me: They couldn't find the order or my account on their system. The only advice they could give me was to place a new order and for obvious reasons I am skeptical. The issue lies with their system, not with me. After having to provide proof through screenshots to show I had actually placed an order that hadn't been received, the person I spoke to hesitantly offered me a measly 10% discount for my troubles.I am very disappointed with the way this matter was handled and I will never order from ASOS ever again."
"September 13, 2017",1,Absolutely shocking customer service,"Absolutely shocking customer service! Ordered a voucher for my nephew's birthday. Had to login using my old Twitter account, because their Facebook connection was defunct. No order confirmation, no nothing! Went into their chat. No record of order, despite the fact they took £50.00 from me! Oh, and it'll take 48 hours to sort out. Birthday ruined. Worse was yet to come. Mid conversation with company and they cut me off! I was not abusive once! DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY. THEY ARE TRULY AWFUL!"

I ordered a blue size 6 dress and i received a pink zise 4 dress. Not even the same model. I returned it back, they didnt answer my messages 5 times after they said they will fix it in 48 hours, after i wrote them last time they said the dress is out of stoc. All this time I could still see it available for someone to buy on their website. They are so bad at communicating ans don't care about their customers. I would never order from them ever again. All this back and forth lasted for more than 10 days just so i don't have a dress anyway and still waiting for my money. The dress is still available now so if someone buys it it won't arrive to them. Sad, dissapointing, the worst!!!"

There customer service do not know if they have ever stocked, or ever will, have these items! All these items are marked with the Asos branding and prices but no one can give me any information, they talk down to me with I have searched and can't find, all things I was well aware of and I had already done, and to check their back in stock daily when we don't even know that these items were ever in stock.they say I should be able to find similar, I don't want similar! I believe thy are guilty of false advertising to get you to look at their site and buy. Anyone know what I can do about this as their condescending answers and refusal to account for themselves are driving me crackers, they are also refusing to send my emails upwards in the management chain to get an answer. also not one of them has referred to the magazine as I have asked."
"September 11, 2017",1,Rubbish Customer Service,"I have only ordered once before from ASOS and they delivered by Royal Mail. No problems at all. Ordered again last week, nightmare began. They despatched my item to Hermes. My heart sank. Delivery date of last Thursday came and went. Tracking claimed they had attempted delivery, two people in the house but no-one arrived, no card left, porch as a safe place had they bothered. Same again Friday. I contacted ASOS via live chat on Friday - they asked me to contact them Saturday if nothing arrived. Hermes claim to have tried to deliver again on Saturday morning (I received a text at 8.10 am and then the tracking claims final attempt made at 8.33 am when three people were in the house, again no card left because no attempt was made). Contacted ASOS via live chat again I was told my complaint had been escalated to the specialist team to investigate and would receive a response in 48 hours, if not sooner.  Monday - nothing from ASOS. The item is supposed to be returned to the supplier after three attempts but my Hermes tracking shows it was on its way back to the courier at 5.25 am Monday morning. At 12.07 pm my tracking tells me an attempt will be made between 10.00 am and 2.00 pm!!  At 12.30 pm, you guess it, another attempt was made and yes I was in the house. On-line Hermes chat again, they are claiming access issues - really, there aren't, Royal Mail have just managed to push my mail through the letter box in the porch door!!!  ASOS are being equally rubbish and I now have to wait until Thursday (when the package won't have been returned to them as they are claiming). ASOS could not check their tracking as it had not updated, so sent them the link to mine showing parcel was not on the way back to them. Soz, can't do anything until Thursday, well Friday as I have to wait until close of play Thursday at which point they will investigate for me!!). Thanks a bunch!!"

She apologied and said she would give me the refund only to then say as my Facebook name doesn't match the account she can no longer give me the refund! Claiming they will breach data protection if they issue a refund...TO THE SAME ACCOUNT THE ITEMS WERE PURCHASED! This is after they have already breached it by going through all the account info with me?!

"September 05, 2017",5,FANTASTIC!,"Quick to reply and informative customer service; Fast shipping; Great Styles; Affordable price; and wide array of brands. What more can I ask for? Maybe just reward long time customers like me by implementing a point system which I can use to redeem items, right ASOS?"
"September 05, 2017",1,Easily broke their promise or word …,Easily broke their promise or word consecutively.Threatened and made fool of the customer.
"September 04, 2017",5,Happy with their service!,"I have ordered multiple things from Asos and there have been cases when the ordered item has not been of outstanding quality, however they have always promptly attended to my issue and resolved it in the best possible way. Returns are always quick, refunds don't take long to process and they are always happy to provide an exchange.Great customer service and great variety of items on their website!"
"September 04, 2017",1,I chatted with JAMEEL,"I chatted with JAMEEL, he was very insulting, rude, slow, unfriendly, and not able to solve my problem. ASOS SUCKS!!!!! Where do they hire these people???!!!!!!"
"September 04, 2017",5,I'm not sure why there's such bad …,"I'm not sure why there's such bad reviews, I've had nothing but great customer services with ASOS? They've replied to my enquiries within 24 hours and delivered parcels within 3-4 days.I could just be lucky but I will continue to shop there."
"September 04, 2017",1,Disappointed,I did a return for a dress of about £80 about 3 weeks ago. ASOS are saying they haven't received it. I seem to have misplaced the proof of postage as I was in the process of moving homes. ASOS are not doing anything to help and I have been a loyal customer for years. Very unhappy :(
"September 04, 2017",1,This should be ZERO STARS,"Absolutely awful customer service. I have had an ongoing - and very basic - inquiry with ASOS about a change to my account and it has taken over one month to do so. Bearing in mind every single other online account where I have changed the same information was simple and with immediate effect.ASOS continue to tell me that they'll be in touch within 24, 48, 72 hours and I am always left to chase them up, week after week.I would give them no stars if it was possible."
"September 03, 2017",1,So disappointed,"So disappointed. I never received item despite it saying it was with the courier, they attempted delivery to my old address (I moved 10 years ago). ASOS cannot communicate with the couriers and if I want the item will have to pay again whilst I wait for them to receive it back and start the refund process. I won't be reordering and am done with the company forever."
"September 02, 2017",5,Perfect,Ordered some clothes online and the whole experience was easy. Clothes look exactly as they did online and delivery was quick and easy.
"September 02, 2017",1,Disgusting Poor Service,"Long story short, Hermes driver marked my delivery as delivered through the letterbox. When I received the email to advise that my parcel had been delivered I checked on the ground floor nothing, checked with everyone in the office ... nothing so I tried to call Hermes could not get through, emailed but it bounced back, tried live chat and it would not connect, eventually found another email address and sent a message. Also contacted ASOS through Twitter who responded but were not helpful. I explained that the office is manned from 8am to 7pm and there's an intercom that the driver could of used so there clearly was no attempt to deliver and the fact that he marked the item as delivered when it wasn't, was a lie. My parcel finally arrived two days later when it was on a next day service to arrive on the Wednesday .... Funny, because they said it was delivered but somehow had the parcel to deliver on the Friday!! Their response was : We make every effort to ensure that you receive your orders on time and are happy with our service. I'm really sorry you're had to wait a little longer; occasionally there are postal delays which are outside our control. We are unable to compensate you on this occasion. Sadly I'm not able to give you a promo code. However, our website, newsletter and social media pages are always packed with promotions - there's bound to be one you can take advantage of very soon. If you sign up to our newsletter or join us on Facebook or Twitter you'll be kept up to date about all upcoming and existing offers and discounts. I can suggest you send the item back for a full refund if you n longer want it. Once we receive it we will notify you and offer process your refund within 24 hours. If you would like help with anything else, please give us a shout.I was absolutely shocked with this response, if a customer has just informed you that their parcel didn't arrive but was marked as delivered there's obviously a problem with the courier which needs to be investigated. I pay for the premium delivery service so I know I can't be refunded for delivery so asked for a small gesture of good will to basically cover the cost of postage which was not fulfilled, and expected at least a 10% code but was confronted with the above response ...., Fuming is an understatement when I spend a lot of money with them. I advised that my account as a VVIP Customer will now be reduced due to the poor customer service from both ASOS and their courier."
"September 01, 2017",1,Really poor service,"Apparently they have no way of communicating with the courier they use - Hermes - so when the inevitable delivery issues occur, they suggest re-ordering as they have no way to find your parcel. Waited over a week for progress on my ""next-day"" delivery, only to be told that an investigation would take place and that I would receive a reply in no more than 3 days. Shocking service."
"September 01, 2017",3,Great stuff,"Great stuff, slow delivery to france for me."
"September 01, 2017",1,I don't get my package like a two weeks …,"I don't get my package from asos like a two weeks ,they told me to pay more money for ups to get my package and it's very expensive ,I'm very disappointed I expected more from a big company...."
"August 31, 2017",1,HORRIBLE,"I ordered the UK2 size, it was really urgent for me. they made the UK3 size looks like UK2 by using a new UK2 tag. I could see it through the product tag. They were supposed to hide this I think. After I ordered that, the UK2 size was suddenly out of stock. I think they don't have UK2 size but they tried to sell it. Customers are not an idiot. I requested to send appropriate size since I HAD TO WEAR THAT NEXT DAY. But, they said they need to collect and investigate that. Now, I have to find new shoes for tomorrow thanks for ASOS's nice solution. REALLY DISAPPOINTED ONLINE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE."
"August 31, 2017",5,Great website,"Great website, easy to use. My order arrived quickly. I will shop again."
"August 31, 2017",1,USED ITEMS SEND TO CUSTOMERS!,"I didn't shop for a while in ASOS as I mostly ended up sending items back but I am going away this weekend and needed pair of jeans ASAP. I've order few other items and ended up spending £200 and got next day delivery. Ive just received everything and was excited to try it on and have a look. In pockets in one pair of jeans i found WASHING POWDER and one of the shirts was very bad quality. I've spoke with customer service and ive sent them a picture. She informed me they can send me replacement in 48-72h, which didn't please me, as im leaving tomorrow and need my stuff now. She said i can order it again for tomorrow and she gave me 10% off code (yuhuuu yeeey....), like my bank account can hold another ASOS order. And extra... the jeans are not even in stock anymore, that's about her offering replacement for me (can't even be bother to check). DONT SHOP IN ASOS. Refund process is long, customer service is sh..., clothes are second hand but charged full price, quility of their own brands...don't let me start on it. Waste of time, waste of money."
"August 31, 2017",4,happy with my order from asos,"happy with my order from asos, ordered a body suit and skirt and used fast post, order arrived on time took about 4 days (I live in NZ). good quality clothing, would buy from their online store again."

I sent it back using the prepaid label which I sent through my internal BBC post and....nothing. I spoke to a lady called Danielle online, and she as good as told me to get lost. Apparently this is customer service you get when a company like ASOS finds success. I'm so disappointed in this experience. Beware people!"
"August 30, 2017",4,Overnight delivery and easy returns,Overnight delivery and easy returns.  Their own branded clothing always comes through disappointing (cheaper quality) but can't beat the choice and service.

"August 26, 2017",5,Went like clockwork,Told when would be delivered. Delivery arrived on time and was left in my safe place. Everything I ordered was as described. Able to return in 30 days. Returned some of my order 2 weeks later and was refunded promptly.
"August 26, 2017",1,Wrong Item Delivered,"Sent me the wrong item that I paid and ordered for next day delivery as I wanted it for the bank holiday weekend. This was a Friday. I asked customer service if they could get the correct item to me before Sunday and they told me no, although if I made a new order and basically paid twice then I could, as it would take at least 48 hours for them to correct the mistake that they made.Horrible customer service and you can only speak to someone on live chat no tel number. No discount offered or anything for the inconvenience caused. Basically just a tough luck and on your way."
"August 26, 2017",1,£300 order delayed with no explanation,"£300 order delayed with no explanation. No support from customer services, who couldn't even cancel and refund it to me. As it is bank holiday weekend this means I will get it three days later, with most of the items meant to be worn before then. Upset. Poor customer service with no way to physically speak to someone."
"August 26, 2017",2,Sizing was off -- way off.,"The shoes they sent were two different sizes. LOL -- like, for real, I'm laughing. I wanted to wear them to a wedding, but I guess I'll have to wear a mangey, 6-year-old pair of flats instead. I did not give them one star for this ""inadequate experience"" because the shoes were cute. I would have kept them except for the sizing. And the package did arrive very quickly."
"August 25, 2017",3,Love their range but the delivery is …,Love their range but the delivery is unreliable when you are relying on them for next day deliverly!!!!!!!!!!
"August 25, 2017",1,Just bad,Just bad! my package was to be delivered in a week. Did not come the day they claimed. I was also never given a tracking number and after hours of talking to their horrible custumer service I got one from a shipping company in the UK. People I live in the U.S. for christ sake! Worst part was to find out that the stupid package has not even left the United Kingdom. Now they tell me to wait until August 31st to contact them again. I never wanted to wait 2 week for a pair of white shoes. Im never buying from them ever again. Terrible company.
"August 24, 2017",5,I order from Asos all the time and …,"I order from Asos all the time and haven't been disappointed by their service once. Great range of products, fast delivery and prompt refunds."
"August 24, 2017",1,HORRIBLE,"HORRIBLE. Got the wrong item, spend an hour describing it to the customer service team, she was so dumb she didnt understand and said she cant help me. no compensation, nothing. just links, links and links."
"August 24, 2017",3,Their prices are ok,"Their prices are ok, is just the mail service they hired won't let you pick up the package even showing your ID"
"August 24, 2017",1,Terrible customer service and absolute …,Terrible customer service and absolute shambles trying to get my refund!! Twice they have lost my parcel in their warehouse - refunding me half of my order!!! JOKE
"August 23, 2017",1,Awful customer serviced I could give a 0 then I would,Awful customer service. I used to pay for 'premier' on 3 occasions my items never showed up next day. Best Asos could do was offer 10%. Their customer service is awful I will never ever buy from them again
"August 23, 2017",1,"Disgraceful, never ever buy from this company.","I am absolutely disgraced by the ASOS 'customer service' team. I made an order for next day delivery over a week ago.. it still hasn't arrived. Not only that, but asos have taken my money, and have lied to me and have said that their chosen courier, DPD, have delivered my parcel! I don't know what to do, ASOS are completely refusing to co operate with me, saying that my parcels been 'signed for' although no one was in, and the parcel quite clearly isn't here, meaning that a member of DPD staff signed for the parcel themselves. I am absolutely outraged, ASOS have taken a lot of money out of my account and haven't provided me with any form of compensation, apology or refund. They're an absolute con."
"August 23, 2017",5,My favourite guilty pleasure 🤣,"If I had billion dollars I would spend them all on Asos. Never had any problems with them in 4 years, or is it 5!? Can only recommend. My husband would be the happiest if Asos wouldn't exist 🤣🤣🤹‍♀️"
"August 23, 2017",5,Fabulous,"I love Asos,Never had a problem with them.Friendly customer service staff over the phone, problems resolved quickly."
"August 23, 2017",1,If I could give them a negative,"If I could give them a negative, I would. When hey had a promo $50 off $200, I ordered $200 worth of stuff and got the discount. However, when the package was delivered, there were 3 items missing. I contacted them the first time, rhey said they would replace those items, but then I waited and waited, nothing happened. I contacted them the second time, one item was sent. The other two items were still missing. So I contacted them again, they refunded me the second item. The third item is still missing. They said that it's because it's out of stock and they can't refund me because it would go below the $200 threshold to be qualified for the discount. The problem is I didn't return anything and it's their fault to not fulfill their job and now they are threatening me that if I keep asking for a refund, they will take off my $49.99 discount. It's ridiculous, I don't understand where the integrity of this company is. They charged me for an item that I'm not receiving, and threatened their customer. Do not do any business with them. They are horrible and worst customer service ever."
"August 22, 2017",1,I am extremely unhappy with their Costumer Service,"I am extremely unhappy with their service. I have been a good client and until my last experience. During my last order number 278833812, they have expired their limit until when I can receive the goods and now they are asking for an extra 72x hours to have a reply from the correct ""department"".I do think that this is inadmissible to have to wait for 72x hours to have them communicating between 2 of their departments, furthermore I have requested to cancel the order (since they have passed the deadline) and they have still demanded to wait for the 72x hours. I had the opportunity to talk with Paul and Diana and I have clearly explained that I cannot wait 72x hours to have a reply from their side and it is inadmissible but nothing was done and they still remain obliging to wait for 72x hours. This is inadmissible! Nothing can justify this, since one if they have lack of staff, this is their fault and it obviously affects the client experience and second if it takes too long to receive a reply form the transporter, it is also their fault since they are the ones who hire them. I am extremely dissatisfied with this the worst costumer experience that I have received so far, and foremost it is my money that they have and they are making me wait to refund it to me! And to finalize my costumer experience Paul has closed the chat in my face without even confirming if I was done or not. This is an outrageous and I cannot believe that a company like Asos can be compliant with this kind to attentiveness."
"August 22, 2017",5,Super service,"ordered on Sunday received the delivery on Wednesday, great quality products and true to size . i am thrilled will definitely buy from again"
"August 22, 2017",1,DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS WEBSITE,"DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS WEBSITE. I had a terrible experience with them. My package was delayed in shipment for no reason. When it was finally out for delivery, they couldn't deliver it and it was returned to sender. Gigantic waste of time and money."

"August 21, 2017",1,Poor Show!,"I ordered a pair of shoes on the 1st of August. It is now the 21st and still no shoes (when I tracked them it said they had been delievered to a ""secure location"". What is their definition of a secure location?). Last week I got in contact to say that I hadn't received the delivery, after countless emails back and forth and still no solution, I decided to ring them. Finding a number to ring them on was a task in itself and when I got through I explained what had happend and a lady said they would send another pair out*. I received an email going over the phone call and it said that i should be expecting a Despatched email. I checked my emails today and still no email. I have gone on a live chat to say that I haven't received an email, and said that either I want the shoes immediately or I want a refund as you've had my money for 21 days and no shoes (which I'd now consider stealing). The idea of a refund was completely ignored and I was told that the investigation team had to look into it and were very busy. Well I have news for asos, they are not the only people who are busy! So now I'm expected to wait even longer (than 21 DAYS) for a pair of shoes. A few days ago I ordered items of Urban outfitter and Schuh and they have arrived early today. I received text message and they gave me options for where they would like it to be delievered if no ones in (I.e a neighbour) and I was really impressed. I wonder why a company like asos can't do that too?  I am really disappointed and fustrated. This was my first order with asos and it came so highly recommended and it's been nothing but a nightmare. Reading through the other reviews it's nice to know that I'm not the only one who's experiencing these problems. And it appears that the customer care team are trained to say the same thing, and their is some sort of good cop bad cop situation going on. One person can be very rude and hang up and then another person would say whatever you want to hear. Poor Show ASOS!  *Whilst on the phone call, I asked for a good will gesture and they gave me15% off my next order (which was very hard to get out of them).But obviously that would require me ordering from them again, which now I am not likely to do.Sorry for the long essay*UPDATE* the shoes are now out of stock so they will give me a refund."

"August 20, 2017",4,Result!,"I share previous posters. They use Hermes, the cheapest of the cheap, and while I have purchased from them for ten years, they are unlikely to get any more business from me unless the replaced delivery arrives on time, AND they refund the first quickly.To be fair to ASOS and to Hermes my replacement delivery arrived ahead of time today."

"August 18, 2017",4,Online orders,I've ordered many times from Asos. Generally it's good delivery and products are good. Returns are easy too. During one purchase I found my delivery box tattered to pieces but it's not happened again.The points system doesn't make much sense to me. It's a bit everywhere for my liking but I continue to shop there time and time again.
"August 18, 2017",1,GOOD GOING BAD!!!!,"I PLACED AN ORDER ON 11.08.2017 FOR NEXT DAY DELIVERY AND TO THIS DAY I'VE YET TO RECEIVED THE ITEMS THAT I PURCHASED.  I GOT A MESSAGE FROM THE DELIVERY COMPANY SAYING IT WILL BE DELIVERED ON 13.08.2018 BUT NO INFORMATION FROM ASOS AS TO WHY THERE IS A DELAY.  A FEW HOURS LATER, AFTER I'VE SELECTED MY DELIVERY TIME SLOT THEY SENT OUT A STANDARD MESSAGE SAYING THERE IS A DELAY AND OFFERING COMPENSATION TO CUSTOMERS WHO PAID FOR THE DELIVERY EXCLUDING THE PREMIUM CUSTOMERS, SO I SENT AND EMAIL ABOUT THIS BUT NEVER GOT A RESPONSE.  CONTACTED SOMEONE ON THEIR CHAT SERVICE ABOUT THIS ISSUE ON THE DAY OF THE DELIVERY AS THE DELIVERY TIME SLOT HAD PAST AND I STILL HAVE NOT GOTTEN MY ITEMS AND I WAS PROVIDED WITH THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL PERSON NAMED TAYYIBAH WHO WOULD NOT HELP ME AND INSTEAD QUOTED ME THE TERMS OF CONDITION AND THEN ABRUPTLY ENDED THE CHAT TELLING ME SHE CANT HELP ME ANYMORE.  AS IT WAS A SUNDAY I COULD NOT SPEAK TO ANYONE OVER THE PHONE SO I DECIDED TO CALL ON THE MONDAY AND SPOKE TO HANNAH WHO WAS REALLY SWEET AND HELPFUL AND TRIED TO HELP ME WITH THE ISSUE.  SHE TOLD ME A THE END OF OUR CALL THAT SHE WOULD SEND A CONFIRMATION EMAIL BUT I NEVER GOT THIS.  I CHASED THIS UP THROUGH THE FACEBOOK MESSENGER SERVICE AND SPOKE WITH SEVERAL PEOPLE BUT NONE OF THEM HELPED.  I JUST WAITED FOR THE DELIVERY TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY IN THE HOPES THAT IT WILL TURN UP BUT AGAIN NOTHING SO THURSDAY MORNING I DECIDED TO CALL DPD THE DELIVERY COMPANY, AND TO MY SURPRISE THE PACKAGE WAS MARKED LOST.  THE GIRL I SPOKE WITH INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS SCANNED INTO THEIR SYSTEM BUT NO FURTHER INFORMATION HAS THEN BEEN PUT IN SINCE THEN.  SO IN A VERY INFURIATED STATE I CALLED ASOS SPOKE TO A RUDE GUY NAMED ROSS WHO TOLD ME THERE SYSTEM IS DOWN SO HE CAN'T HELP AND I JUST HAVE TO CALL BACK LATER, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT MADE ME EVEN MORE ANGRY.  HE SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST OFFERED TO TAKE DOWN MY NUMBER AND CALLED ME BACK ONCE THEIR SYSTEM ISSUE WAS FIXED BUT INSTEAD HE HUNG UP ON ME.  I CALLED BACK RIGHT AWAY AND SPOKE WITH A GIRL NAMED TAMALA, AND MIRACULOUSLY THERE SYSTEM WAS BACK UP AND SHE COULD NOW HELP.  I EXPLAINED TO HER WHAT THE ISSUE AND SHE TRIED TO HELP AND PROMISED THAT I WOULD GET A REPLACEMENT FOR THE ITEMS THAT I ORDERED THAT IS NOW LOST AND ALSO GET A MANAGER TO CALL ME BACK.  I SAID TO HER THAT I WANT THE MANAGER TO CALL ME BACK IN A FEW HOURS AND THAT SHE WOULD SEND ME A CONFIRMATION EMAIL AND AGAIN LIKE THE LAST TIME I NEVER GOT THE EMAIL  AND THE CALL BACK FROM A MANAGER NEVER HAPPENED.  TO ADD INSULT TO THE INJURY AN ITEM THAT I SENT BACK TO BE REPLACED FOR A DIFFERENT SIZE ON SATURDAY ARRIVED WHILE I WAS ON THE PHONE TO TAMALA, SO THIS JUST ADDED FUEL TO THE FLAME.  I DECIDED TO CALLED BACK AFTER NOT HEARING FROM A MANAGER AND SPOKE TO MARY WHO WAS REALLY RUDE AND VERY CONDESCENDING AND REFUSES TO PUT ME THROUGH TO A MANAGER AND SAID THEY HAVE PROCESS AND THAT I'VE TOLD THIS ALREADY SO SHOULD JUST WAIT.  I CALLED THE HEAD OFFICE TO SEE IF I CAN SPEAK TO SOMEONE IN CHARGE OF THE CS TEAM BUT AGAIN NO ONE CAN SPEAK TO ME AND WAS REDIRECTED BY THEIR RECEPTIONIST TO CALL THE CS TEAM.  I CALLED THE CS TEAM YET ANOTHER TIME AND THIS TIME SPOKE WITH ROB WHO WAS VERYS SWEET AND TRIED TO HELP COME TO A RESOLUTION, I REALLY THOUGHT THAT IT WAS RESOLVED BUT STILL LEFT ME VERY DISAPPOINTED.  TODAY, I GET MESSAGE FROM A GIRL NAMED TASHA THROUGH THEIR FACEBOOK MESSENGER NOT EVEN VIA EMAIL TO SAY THEY TRIED TO REPLACE THE ITEMS BUT ITS OUT OF STOCK SO THEY ARE JUST GOING TO REFUND ME THE MONEY BUT STILL SEND ME THE ITEM THAT IS OUT OF STOCK,  I SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST BEEN GIVEN THE OPTION TO CHOOSE TO GET A DIFFERENT SIZE CONSIDERING IVE MENTIONED ON TWO OCCASIONS THAT I WIL BE WEARING IT FOR LONDON FASHION WEEK BUT NO THERE WAS NONE OF THAT.  I CALLED  TO SEE IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO JUST GET A DIFFERENT SIZE BUT WAS TOLD NO THEY ARE PRETTY BLACK AND WHITE WITH REPLACEMENTS AND THAT THEY CANT DO ANYTHING FOR ME ANYMORE.  I AM STILL VERY DISAPPOINTED AND DEFINITELY QUESTIONS WHETHER I SHOULD REMAIN A CUSTOMER."
"August 18, 2017",1,Disappointment after disappointment...,Really disappointed with ASOS and their 'premier' delivery service - countless times I've placed an order for next day delivery and it's been delayed - the most recent order by 48hours when I needed the item for an event. It wouldn't be so bad if their customer service wasn't equally as shambolic - numerous emails sent and PMs on social media - no response and can't find a contact number anywhere to speak to a real person. I love fashion and the brands that ASOS sell but they need to refine their delivery and customer service IMHO. I certainly will not be recommending them and will not be renewing my 'premier' delivery subscription.
"August 17, 2017",1,Shocking,"A  £1000 order missing and no one able to give me an answer. Staff are rude, incompetent and sexist."

"August 14, 2017",1,Would avoid,"Would avoid. Placed an order with 2 items in it. Parcel arrived but was sent the wrong needle and thread embellished maxi dress. Asking customer support for help was pointless. They offered no help whatsoever, the dress was not replaced with the correct item. Nightmare, worst still I paid over a £100 for the dress and now due to their incompetence I am without a dress for a wedding in 3 days time and also need to wait a fortnight for a refund.I have absolutely no problem with returning the incorrect item but at least I expect to be sent the correct item."
"August 14, 2017",1,AVOID!! AVOID!! AVOID!!,"Oh my goodness stay away from this company it is absolutely shocking!!  The last couple of times ive ordered from asos I've had numerous problems like them sending the wrong item then a replacement being out of stock then shocking customer service trying to sort the issues out. I said I would never order from this company again (silly me) I give in as they had a specific item in stock that I failed to find anywhere else online so I paid for next day delivery and nothing arrived, I spoke on live chat and was told it would be the following day and still nothing, all I get from them is it will be the following day and still nothing has arrived. This company is criminal and should be shut down immediately!!"
"August 13, 2017",1,If I could rate lower I would,"If I could rate lower I would. I ordered two belts, what arrived was one of the belts I'd ordered and a disgusting baby pink visor. So, I fill out the returns form and send the ugly visor back, then get straight onto Twitter to try to resolve the issue and have the second belt I ordered sent to me. I'm met with total radio silence. So, I email and, after days of back and forth, they finally put through a request for a replacement on next day delivery. I log in to my account to see that the ""replacement"" they have requested is for the belt that actually turned up in the first place. I call their customer service team and am told that it's my responsibility to ensure that the second incorrect item is returned too, and that I'll have to wait another 48 hours for the request for the item I asked for in the first place to be processed. It's extremely worrying when their core function as a business is something they are simply not able to do. I was offered a 10% discount code as an apology (that expires in two weeks!!!), but why on earth would I want to give this awful company yet MORE of my money when they've yet to rectify the issue with my outstanding order?! Avoid at all costs!"
"August 12, 2017",1,The worst service client ever..,"The worst service client ever... they messed up, sending me a total different product (ugly leather shoes when i ordered espadrilles) on which i had to pay crazy customs taxes... they refuse to refund me those fees when THEY messed up and ask me to return the wrong shoes at my own expense. I was fine with any compensation, any way to solve the problem, but there is absolutely nothing to get from them. They do not get anything about client service... sad but hopefully there is tons of other sites where to spend my money."
"August 12, 2017",1,Lost $100 AND they size their jeans wrong :),"I wish I could give a 0. I ordered a bunch of jeans in a waist size 25, they came and measured out to be 23 instead. Bad enough already. And they don't offer exchanges, you have to return the items and reorder them in a different size. Well when I returned them they would not refund me everything that I spent because of a promo code I used. Yes they took $100 from a high school student, lovely company :) And the customer service representative treated me like I was dumb and then ended the chat suddenly with no warning. This really sucks because after all this I don't wanna buy from them ever again but they are one of two stores I know that sells the kinds of jeans I like available in petite sizes, the other being Topshop but theirs are too expensive. So I either have to support a company that scammed me out of $100 or have like 2 pairs of jeans because Topshop's are like $80 and I can't afford so many of those."

"August 12, 2017",1,Abysmal.Service.Of.Sales #ASOS,"Absolutely disgusting I ordered a parcel for next day delivery didn't come through, then rang up the services they lost my parcel and couldn't give me a refund within 72 hours or couldn't send me out the same items for the next day, so I then had to order the package for next day delivery again which also didn't come through . the first order has come through a day late being told I would get a refund for it being lost but actually it's shown up and then I have been told I can't get a refund now unless I send it back, so I have been made to make a second order yet it wasn't actually needed so I am down money because I have to send one back which I was told was lost . So not only has the phone service given me false knowledge of the packages and delivery they have also caused me too spend money that is inappropriate to spend and they have also given me a terrible service"
"August 12, 2017",1,A no longer a loyal customer!,"I'm previously a very loyal customer to Asos but not anymore!! Awful customer services. I ordered a top which arrived in awful quality with stains on and loose threads, I complained and was told to send the faulty top back and will receive a refund, and they will send me a new top. Received another top which was fine, but a few weeks passed and I didn't get my refund, I messaged them again and they explained I won't be getting one because I received a new top!! Also they took days to reply to my messages and were not particularly polite or willing to help"
"August 11, 2017",1,Awful customer service,I received the wrong item and therefore wasn't able to get the correct one while it's still in stock. They simply said there's nothing they can do with very condescending attitude and did not even apologise. Very very bad experience.
"August 11, 2017",1,Most of the products are okay,"Most of the products are okay, that's if its a name brand label; thus its expected. Man... where do I begin? The customer service/agents sucks and are very robotic. I am being pushed around and still awaiting a refund for an item that I returned to their center and delivered on 7/28/17. Today is 8/11/17 and nothing. I contacted them on 8/8/17 and got the run around to wait a until 8/10/17. Contacted them today 8/11/17 and was told they will have to do a 48hrs investigation and they will get back to me. This is 2017; what kind of crap is this? You received my item and obviously someone messed up on your end and I the paying customer who's been waiting 14 days already have to continue to wait while you investigate? If an ASOS rep is reading, PLEASE NOTE THAT I WANT MY MONEY BACK IMMEDIATELY (Order# 275567313). This isn't how customer service is done. Once proof is provided, the customer should be refunded while you investigate period!!!!!!!!! I AM EXTREMELY AGGRAVATED!!!"

The courier was hermes who stated they attempted delivery today at 12.17. i have been in all day, no one has attempted delivery. I have contacted asos today to resolve this and they have said they can do nothing about it and i will have to wait for it to be redelivered tomorrow. i Specifically ordered next day delivery because it was a gift for a party i am going to this evening. Even after explaining this, i was told ''wait for delivery tomorrow, thats all i can do''.This is utterly disgusting customer service, especially as I am a very active customer through Asos. I wasn't even offered a refund on the delivery charge!!!i now have to go out of my way and buy another gift just so i dont look bad, and still have to hand over the original gift because that is what they asked for.because of your error, i am going to be out of pocket, yet there is nothing you can do about it? this is disgusting.Will never use you again unless i get a response to my liking!"

Customers first? No, salary and a happy boss first."

They sent me a complimentary code which does not work. This company was very good before. Now it sucks. The management should train their representatives to provide better customer service. It has become a junk full of liars. They cheated me...still they are not able to resolve the issue. DO NOT TRUST THEM!"

"August 07, 2017",1,ASOS have a habit of putting PROMO …,"ASOS have a habit of putting PROMO codes on their site and taking them away without notice BEFORE the expiry date of the promotion, hence making us miss out on the savings we could make.  In my case, the promo was to expire at 11:59pm AEST on Tuesday 8 August 2017.  So I put the $322 coat in my basket with the intention of buying it today - 7 August - with my $70 discount promo code.  Surprise surprise the code has now been taken off the site more than 24 hours before the published end date - so no discount for me.  When I asked ""customer service"" I was told they would not honour the code unless I had a screen shot of the small print.  And again, surprise surprise, I can't get a screen shot of the small print because they have removed it from their site!!!  What a crock - that's all I can say.  Sometimes you can get too big and lose sight of the small things.  Asos NOT COOL."
"August 06, 2017",1,Hundred over dollars worth of order did not arrive.,"I have spent thousands of dollars ordering from ASOS for years. I never returned even when they once  sent the wrong order once. I placed an order of over hundred dollars in October 2016, I was very busy and was preparing to leave the country for a few months ( there's always someone at home despite me being away) and forgot about the order. The order did not arrive. When I realised that, I contacted them but they told me it's been too long and their policy stated that they can't process the query."
"August 06, 2017",5,Best online shopping place for chlothes.,"I love this company, you get free standard shipping over £20 which is amazing and you can return anything you don't like to get a full refund. Their customer service is also great and they have a huge range of everything in terms of chlothes. Also they provide a return sticker which makes the returning process even easier. I don't know why people have given it a very low score?"

So my order will be delivered to the wrong old address and Mosy likely will be lost, and my money will not be refunded . This is cruel because we work so hard to be able to shop on that expensive website . They ASOS team need to do something about their rules"

Shipping is free and fast. Only thing I'm missing from them is free returns. Also, I would for sure do 90% of my online shopping from them if they covered import taxes. Other than that, great place to shop from."

Despite receiving a worn, faded and without any tags jacket, they credited by account believing it was the replacement jacket I had just purchased from them for £30. I contacted them as soon as I received their email confirming the credit, asking that they return the Superdry jacket as I was due a refund of £65 from the original retailer. Despite telling them it was clearly a combination of Hermes and their error, for accepting the jacket as a 'return', on a branded product they don't even sell, I received a constant stream of emails stating 'my mistake'  and 'that wasn't a good start' suggesting it was all my fault! The jacket is now 'lost', so if anyone receives a worn and faded Superdry jacket when they thought they had purchased a small Black Bomber with zip on sleeve, please let me know!"
"August 04, 2017",1,Mad at myself for trying asos,"Honestly I read reviews about this website and a lot of them were really bad but I saw a couple claiming positive stuff like ""I loved the things I got"" and there was one comment that convinced me to just try it, it's was ""idk why there are so many bad reviews it's probably just competitors trying to bad mouth this website.."" TRUST ME IT IS NOT. I've tried tons of online shopping sites and this one is by far the worst! Yeah sure I got my stuff but let me tell you 1. It was pretty horrid quality... all of the tags say ""made in Pakistan or Egypt.... 2. All the fabric is cotton so if you wash it and wanna dry it ... IT WILL SHRINK! And 3 the thing that drove me ******* insane was the fact that I agreed on paying $108 for everything... I got charged $176 on my bank statement!!!!! AND ON TOP OF THAT had to pay an extra $50 on customs and delivery when my order came to the door. Asos claims it is free world wide shipping but don't trust it. I ended up paying a giant total of $226 for 6 articles of clothing... I'm so upset especially since I only agreed on spending $108 :( Do yourself a favour and forget you saw this website. Trust me you can find a WAY better one. You already know I won't be shopping here again. Oh and if I could rate this thing with a negative I totally would but apparently they don't give you that option."
"August 04, 2017",1,"First Impressions ... Not good, stressful experience","Hi, My first experience with ASOS has been extremely disappointing. I placed an order on Sunday which was meant to reach me yesterday, however the tracking information showed that the order had not been received by Royal Mail. I contacted ASOS who assured me it would still be delivered and so I waited in all day and it didn't arrive. I then found an email in my junk inbox notifying me of a return I had made and that all the items would be refunded. I then was told I would have to re-order the whole order and pay again so I would be out of pocket until my refund comes through. Luckily only one of the items I ordered was out of stock however it is disappointing that an order that was clearly not a return was processed as a return and put back into the system for someone else to purchase. The customer service I have received has been very disappointing from a company I had expected more from. I have now had to re-purchase the items that are still in stock whilst waiting for a refund on an order that I never received so I am out of pocket, but have no choice as if I wait the items will be out of stock."

So, we did the express shipping for the items to reach within 5 business days. So the parcel had to arrive on the 13July as a birthday surprise. Paid about 200NZD for the 2 items and express shipping included. We ended up getting the items on the friday. At least I was able to get her a cake for the day. It sucked I could not surprise her with the items because it was her first birthday we celebrated as a couple. All I want to know is, why did we pay for express shipping? If the items came at standard shipping days. Thanks for ruining the day thumbs up."

"July 31, 2017",1,Just ordered a top for my daughter,"Just ordered a top for my daughter, size 8, she then informs it needs to be a 10. Thought I would go on the site and request change to size as only ordered 1 hr ago. For standard delivery you are given 60 mins to cancel, I tried to cancel after 65 mins. I then got onto their web chat help to see if they could put through the amend, they advised there was nothing they could do to intercept the order and I would have to return the item and stand the postage. All this for 5 mins over the time, its not as though I even wanted to cancel the order, just change size before the order was posted. I asked to put through to their Complaints team, was advised they didn't have a Complaints team, how can any organisation of reasonable size not have a complaints team, that smacks of real arrogance , inflexibility and contempt for their customers. really not impressed, won't be returning."
"July 31, 2017",1,Waste of money,"Ordered swimsuits for an upcoming trip last Monday. They said it would be delivered Friday at the latest. I sent customer service an email (no response). Then I tweeted @ASOS_HeretoHelp on Thursday letting them know that UPS's tracking website said that the shipment label had been created but that it hadn't been shipped to them yet. ASOS DM'd me back and said that the shipping label was probably damaged and that it should arrive on time. Messaged them again Friday letting them know that my package hadn't arrived. They messaged me back to tell me that they passed this onto their ""delivery investigation team"" to look into and that I would receive an update in 48 hours. 48 hours response time is ridiculous. Didn't hear from the ""delivery investigation team"" over 48 hours later so DM'd them again at 4 pm to which they ignored my messages/tweets (as I see them responding to other people on twitter). They finally message me at 12 am ""You've now been refunded 113.00 USD to your MasterCard today the 31st July for your order as the items are now out of stock. The funds can take 5-10 working days to appear in your account so you'll receive it by the 14th of August at the latest. If there are any other questions just let us know and we'll be happy to help."" No apology, or anything. After reading the reviews I'm nervous about the package I returned hopefully I'll get a refund for that. With such a big business, how do they not have a customer service phone number? I've emailed the ""customer service email"" multiple times in the past with no response."

But they have been up and coming and clearly become more reputable business so the customer service has significantly decreased to a point I am considering boycotting their website. I ordered from ASOS and both parcels were not delivered on time. One was delivered to a neighbour without my consent and the parcel was open and a £10 pair of sandals were taken. When I went back to complain to asos, this billion pound company, they claim it is a dispute between me and my neighbour. Its just disgusting to think that a company cannot use any discretion whatsoever, they'd rather have a customer ruin their reputation online than actually resolve disputes, its a shame."

I have been trying to reach them since around 10pm and it's now 7am and I still can't get a response.  They have £200 of my money and I have no money for holiday and no clothes to show for it, and I can't even contact them to complain.  It's BAD."

They have sent me faulty items, or refunded the wrong item. Recently they claim never to have received the returned items I have sent them and have refused to refund. Unfortunately I have misplaced the post office receipt and they say that until the parcel reaches them it is ""my responsibility"". This is not mentioned in their return policy, and it does not say anywhere that they are exempted from refunding in the case of item being lost in the post. I am disappointed as the fact that I have been a loyal customer for years has not been considered at all! It is hurtful to be accused of lying. I will not be returning as a customer. Be aware !"

"July 25, 2017",1,Buyer Beware,"I had no idea ASOS was a UK company.  When I searched up a dress their website came up. The prices were in Canadian dollars and shipping was free (I therefore assumed it was Canadian).  I know there was mention that duty may apply (somewhere in their terms & conditions) but I dismissed this, thinking I wasn't shopping internationally.  I understand duty fees vary from one country to the next, so the amount cannot be calculated at the time of checkout. However, when duty charges do apply to certain countries there should be a ""plus duty fees will apply"" statement on the checkout. I thought I was getting a great deal, and now I'm having to pay $73 in duty fees.   Customer service was of no use. I'm pretty much stuck because I paid a shipping fee to have it expedited, and will now have to pay to have it shipped back.   They really need to put prices in pounds initially, and then allow customers to change it to their currency.  My first & last time shopping with ASOS."
"July 25, 2017",5,Continually impressive,Have used ASOS UK numerous times from different locations around the world and love the value and speed at which they deliver. Have had three perfect deliveries in a month to Australia.
"July 25, 2017",1,Terrible customer service,"I returned an item to ASOS on 11 July 2017, based on the fact it was discoloured and of absolutely terrible quality. It in no way resembled the product portrayed on their website. It is now 25 July and I am still waiting on my refund to be processed. On contacting customer service, I was informed that if I did not receive a refund by 21 July, I should contact them with postage information and they will process my refund. I did exactly that, and was informed by a rude and condescending customer representative (Alena) that I should wait another couple of days for the refund to be processed. After doing exactly this, I followed up with several other customer service reps, who have asked me to wait and wait for the refund to be processed. I really question whether I will ever receive my refund, and believe that the customer service reps will just continue to defer my enquiry. I online shop all the time, but this is by far the worst customer service I have ever received. I would seriously discourage anyone from ordering from ASOS in the future - I know they have a wide range of products, but it's just not worth the hassle if something doesn't match its appearance on the website. Their customer service staff are condescending, and simply ignore queries rather than taking meaningful action. They have no respect for the time of their customers."

I had purchased the TALL Scoop Front Swimsuit Multipack-Black/White (size 8 US). I am 5'11'' and it is already hard to find bathing suits for my height so once I received the black bathing suit it fit perfectly and I am extremely happy with it! Even though the two bathing suits are the same size the white one had a little bit more excess fabric along the sides which made it not as fitting in the waist as the black one. Other than that very happy with this site and will be ordering more items in the future!"
"July 24, 2017",1,Bad unreliable courier & bad customer service.,"I did my first order with asos the other day for a dress for a wedding. As wedding was taking place a few days after I ordered with next day delivery. As it was important to try the dress on prior to the wedding, and If it wouldn't fit, I would have to look for a new one elsewhere urgently. I got up at 7 am as the delivery would take place between 7am-10pm, spent all day at home, did not leave the house for even 2 minutes. When it was evening and no delivery had been made I tracked the parcels whereabouts, according to their couriers website and attempt had been made around 17. This was clearly incorrect and so I therefor contacted asos via chat. Gentleman there told me it could be an error and to contact them again should the delivery not been made by 22pm.No delivery was made.I contacted them again today with this information, as I paid extra for a next day delivery, that didn't happen, I expected to get refunded for this. However, ""as a delivery attempt had been made"" (complete lies), there was nothing they could do.When tracking my parcel today it shows as delivered, apparently it was delivered through letterbox. It's a shame as it was my firs order that the delivery service obviously is unreliable And then that customer support doesn't help you.This was my first and last order with Asos."

And after more than 3 days i still have no response. On Facebook you will get awnsers from different people. There hasn't been a situation that one person will help me. it always takes 30 minutes to an hour untill they respond if you're lucky. Through E-mail i NEVER got an reply. Please do yourself a favor and NEVER order from this crappy store. I also read other comments from people that they never even received their packages..
"July 18, 2017",1,Worst and most unorganized customer …,Worst and most unorganized customer service ever.If you manage to get an order with no issues then asos is great but if you encounter any kind of problem good luck getting them to help at all!
"July 18, 2017",4,Could have been 5*,"Although stock levels could sometimes do with updating more frequently, I have never had a major issue with ASOS. There is always a range of products on sale, which is even better with my Unidays student discount when buying something on sale through ASOS with my 10% discount compared to purchasing the exact same item from the original company. The ClickCollect+ is just behind my home too, what could be better!!"

"July 18, 2017",1,I ordered a dress for my baby shower …,"I ordered a dress for my baby shower choosing 4 day shipping. 15 days later..nothing. I first contacted customer service and they said it would be delivered the following Friday. A week later and nothing. Its now scheduled for the next Friday and when I tried to contact them about they pretty much said sorry but it should be delivered by ""X date"". I messaged them after demanding they over nighy it with no response. What a joke. NEVER ordering from them again."
"July 17, 2017",1,"ASOS Customer ""Care"" no longer existent","Sent an item back via Royal Mail 15 days ago, even though tracking says it has arrived and I have sent numerous messages with proof of postage etc - ASOS Customer Care still haven't issued my refund, because their apparently super busy and overworked! ASOS Customer Service had really deteriorated! Their staff send generic impersonal responses to messages/queries and you won't actually get any useful response from them. They also now have made it only possible to contact their Customer Service via one channel - Twitter! Therefore set up an account with Twitter prior to ordering anything from ASOS, as the likelihood is that at some point you will need to contact them. However don't expect a useful speedy response and they can't seem to cope with the number of messages they receive. Therefore it is easier for them to just copy and paste the same response to several people.It is such a shame that a brand that was so forward thinking and revolutionary in the online shopping experience 12 years got greedy and expanded too much and no longer have the manpower and resources to enable a smooth and outstanding shopping experience. ASOS - maybe step back re-evaluate how unhappy you are making your customers and go back to your original standards!"
"July 16, 2017",5,Super!,"Big selection, including make up which is really handy as not all of it is available in my country. Clothing quality is amazing for the price, nice and long in length too. At 5'8"" as a woman, lots of clothes come up short for me but Asos is great."
"July 16, 2017",1,Very frustrating experience,"I placed an order on Friday, paid a tenner for next day delivery to ensure delivery on Saturday, I have been constantly tracking this as I need the parcel this weekend, yet it still hasn't arrived. It is Sunday now and no explanation has been offered and I am being told to just wait until Monday to see if it arrives but if not I can contact ASOS again?! ASOS still cannot promise when this will arrive, they haven't advised why this has been delayed and they haven't offered even a refund on the next day delivery premium I paid. They have offered 10% off my next order provided it's full price items only and there is also a deadline of a month - clearly not something I'll be using given my current order isn't even here yet. A very frustrating experience - avoid!"
"July 16, 2017",1,Crap!,"I have been shopping online for over 3years and I must say for the first time my parcel went missing. Not blaming Asos for missing parcel but why do I have to be the victim of lost, inconvenience, waiting for over 2 weeks for investigation of delivery company when clearly it has been established that I haven't received my parcel. I should have been refunded or repost my order until investigation is completed. Customer service is absolutely useless , email responses are unhelpful so what's the point? I will not be ordering anything else from Asos and I shall spread the word far and wide definitely would not recommend anyone to shop with Asos, disgusting !!"
"July 15, 2017",1,The worst customer service I've experienced.,"I paid to sign-up the ASOS Premier service because I needed next day delivery and thought it would make sense as I was likely to make further orders.Although the guaranteed next day delivery date was provided, the morning of the guaranteed date I received an email saying the parcel was delayed.The customer service team simply don't care. Don't waste your time."

"July 14, 2017",1,ASOS sent wrong item and doesn't even know it....,I ordered a Women's sneaker and they sent me the same item in the men's version instead. After sending NUMEROUS emails that this was sent in the men's size and not the women's the customer service still did not understand the issue!!! They kept saying if you don't like the item send it back for refund when clearly all I asked was for the women's size and version of the shoe to be sent!!! Because I actually did order the women's version of the shoe so why wasn't it sent properly to me?? Yet the staff still didn't understand and I am sitting here completely frustrated at how horrible this customer service is and probably won't ever receive my shoe. Best part is I can't even call them since I am in the US and their number won't work on my phone. I am very disappointed with the customer service to say the least
"July 14, 2017",1,Customer Services Suck,"I returned items for a refund and ASOS will not refund the postage.  Its not their ""Policy"". I have requested  at least 5 times by email that the matter to be brought to a managers attention.  I am still waiting.  I get replies from badly trained (if at all) customer service operatives.  Clearly, as a customer, ASOS don't think I am worth it. Spend your money with a company that cares just a fraction more than ASOS."

She processed the order, confirmed it and everything then realized she didn't want the order so she canceled it (idiot). The payment was taken from my checkings, I've been waiting to receive a refund payment from ASOS, this is the 10th day, haven't received anything. I called my bank because they said my bank is withholding the money, not them. In my payment history, the ASOS purchase was no where to be found."
"July 13, 2017",1,Worst customer service ever,"Worst customer service ever. I ask for a return label and tell them repeatedly I cant print, they keep telling me the same information thats already on the website instead of just telling me they wont help me and that I have to figure out myself how to get it printed as they simply wont help me get it.... wow. other shops just include a freaking return label for free in the order and they force people to print it themselves and if they have no printer then the hassle is for them. such great service, wow. and especially love the way they treat you like a person of questionable intelligence. this surely puts me off to ever order there again. besides, I had to send back pretty much everything as the stuff just isnt as good as it seems.. I just hope Ill get my money back without too much trouble and having to get paypal on their back.... *sigh*Only good thing I experienced is that the website holds a good part of info to make it easy to order and also it arrived very fast... but its so dissapointing to be treated this way..."

I always receive the correct items in great condition, and when I return items I receive the correct refunds. Everything is confirmed by email which helps to keep track. I haven't needed to contact customer service that often, but when I have they have been very helpfulThe A-list rewards are a great touch and make you feel like you are a valued customerKeep up the good work ASOS!"

They said it may take up to 21 + 3 days to get my money back!No item that I ordered, no compensation, no replacement and up to 1 month waiting for my money back!!!!After my complaint they gave me 20% discount on any full price item, at the time where 20% is off as a sale on most items.Feeling a special treatment hah!NEVER AGAIN!"

"July 11, 2017",1,Never Delivered Package,"Ordered something on April 30th, it said it would be delivered by May 11th. Well it was never delivered. I've contacted Asos several times and have talked to numerous customer service agents. They all say they want to help me but then they stop replying to my emails. All I want is a refund. I've now taken to twitter to see if that helps. I've had so many issues with Asos, that this will be the last time I order from them. It's pretty sad because they have nice clothing. I see on this site that other people are having the same issue as me -_-"
"July 11, 2017",1,Customer Service playing around with me...,"I bought 5 dresses - meant to use them for a wedding ceremoni - so many bad things happened:1) one dress were missing2) did almost not get the replacement on time3) ended up returning all items as it did not fit all of us4) only get refund for 4 dresses5) have a heck of a long correspondent with the customer service. After a while they agree that only four items have been processed, but now, as a new customer service girl (again) takes over, she states that all 5 are refunded. That's just not the case.6) seems like she also closed the file, I am not getting any further reply...Asos is truly a big mess when it comes to solving problems THEY happen to make."
"July 10, 2017",1,Absolutely awful,"A classic case of false advertising. I ordered a formal dress from this website, and I ordered it in three different sizes, as the sizing chart on Asos is unreliable. When it arrived I instantly noticed the feeling of cheap material, which I was willing to overlook if the dress fitted nicely. It was only when I put it on that I noticed how bad the seams of the dress were, as they were all fraying, and that they had all been somewhat crooked. The zippers on all three dresses were cheap and keep getting stuck on nothing.Overall, it was a complete waste of money, and I will be returning the dresses. I would not recommend this website to anyone."
"July 10, 2017",1,If I could give 0 stars,"If I could give 0 stars, ASOS had it.I ordered a product and paid. The product did not arrive so ASOS created a new order but then the item was out of stock. Now I can not get in touch with ASOS and they do not refund my money even though I'm writing through PayPal."
"July 10, 2017",3,Customer service needs to be improved but problem rectified.,"UPDATE: After a lot of grief the manager sent me an apology and a 20% voucher. I have ordered from ASOS since 2008 so it's only fair I update the rating to a 3. Usually great service but when there are issues they really need to resolve them much quicker than in this case. Customers don't want to spend this amount of time chasing one refund and going through needless weeks of email correspondence - especially when this issue could have been resolved in 5 minutes by competent customer service representatives. Previous 1 star rating review: Bought two pairs of jeans from ASOS. Kept less expensive pair and other pair were too big so sent back. They refunded wrong jeans, owe me £44 which they repeatedly acknowledge via approximately 14 emails to date. They continually give me dates to wait until ""as the refund will take 5 - 10 days"" and two months later there is no sign of a refund. Now they do not even answer my emails. Definitely the worst customer service of all time. Will never place an order with them again.Monday 10th July - Am now being told that I have to prove that I didn't receive my £44 refund. They need all my bank statements since the transaction showing all my transactions to prove that I didn't receive the refund. No suggestion of them actually checking why the refund did not go through their end. Have to provide confidential account information to ASOS to prove that a refund didn't come through. Sounds simple enough but given that the information changes depending on who answers the email every day, this is far from the end of this issue. I am going to update this every day so you can all see how much of a disaster their customer ""service"" is.."
"July 09, 2017",2,Bad customer service,"I experienced problems when I had to pay at the checkout. I contacted the firm several times, and the few times I received an answer, the answer was not satisfying or helpful. It confuses me, that the company does so little to help a costumer, who's willing to spend (and has spent in the past) a lot of money on their website. This will be the last time I will use ASOS' services, unless there will come a clear improvement in the way they 'help' their customers."
"July 08, 2017",1,Holdall 100% guilt free,"Received my birthday present from dad of a pink urbancode leather holdall, item was miss labelled to be 100% guilt free that no animals were harmed in the making of the bag. ..... then how can it be leather I ask? Urbancode apologised saying it was Miss labelled with their fux fur label. So I contacted asos via fb as there's no email customer service contact and spoke with ""em"" (emma, Amy who ever very unprofessional) an she went over all this nonsense about getting my father to contact them lol a none computer tech man .....even tho I'd provided her everything she asked for. What a joke of a company! Customer service much to be desired!"
"July 08, 2017",1,I'm really disappointed,"I'm really disappointed. I've been waiting for 2 different packages from ASOS since April (17) & nothing has arrived. Since then, it has been 3 months and ASOS doesn't provide the refund I deserve. I have received 8 different emails from different representatives asking to verify my address/ suggesting to check in few places. It is really frustrating..."
"July 08, 2017",1,This website sucks,"I ordered three things from asos. They arrived on time but when they arrived I noticed that they were cheap quality and one of the items was not what I ordered.

"July 07, 2017",1,Asos has completely gone down hill,"Asos has completely gone down hill, it seems the bigger they have become the less they feel they should deliver a good service and not to mention well manufactured clothing. They clearly don't carry out quality control as a sweatshirt I recently ordered had two different sized cuffs!I wish I could include pictures on here as it really does show how shockingly different they are.AVOID using Asos, there's far better out there and far better places to spend you money on and get what you actually should be getting - well made clothes with a great customer service to go with it!"

Sent me completely the wrong item which I have returned and am waiting for the refund as the original top I ordered was now out of stock. Have sent about 6 emails asking what they plan to do about the lost 20% discount, it was s single use card, not one response. Won't use them again"
"July 05, 2017",1,Careless,"Careless, sloppy organisation and the prices are not even particularly competitive. In my experience they send the wrong item as often as they send the correct one. My last order from them included an item I hadn't ordered, a cheap looking necklace. I suppose I should have kept quiet and thrown it away. When I asked them how to send it back they told me I had to parcel it up and take it to the post office.  My son ordered a jacket, at a price of over £190, and they sent him a pair of cheap trousers by mistake. They then said the item he ordered was no longer in stock but they wouldn't refund his money until he had returned the cheap trousers that they had sent by mistake.   I won't order from them again. They should be sued more often."
"July 05, 2017",1,If I could give no stars I would,"If I could give no stars I would. Ordered a dress for my daughters prom, delivery was great arrived next day like I had payed for, opened the parcel all excited to see what it was going to look like for my daughter only to find it was completely the wrong dress, wrong colour, size and nothing like I had ordered. Emailed, messengered and tried to call to resolve the matter quickly. Had no response for ages. Finally got an email back apologising and saying that they would send me the correct dress out and  refund the postage costs (great I thought it will be sorted) this was on the Friday.  Monday came and I had not been updated in the correct dress being sent out so I emailed again (at this time the dress was still in stock) by Tuesday no response so I emailed again. I then checked online to make sure the dress was still in shock and surprise surprise they had completely sold out. I finally got an email back after again emailing my concerns. They told me that that morning they had gone to pack the dress and realised it was out of stock even though they had told me they had sorted the correct dress on the Friday to be delivered to me. Now I have no dress and no money to order a new one as they are telling me it can take 10 days before they can confirm the returned dress is back and 5 more days for the money to be refunded, that's 15 days, my daughters prom is in 10 days and I do not have more funds for a second dress, iv told them this but they do not care. I have sent proof of postage and that should be enough for them to issue my refund. I have been emailing back and fourth and never have the same person reply and they all say different things, they are in competent and unprofessional and I have never experienced such an awful customer service.  Asos was once a great company but has seriously gone down hill. I will never use them again. I don't usualy post reviews but I felt I needed to warn others. I'm now stuck and have no idea what to do. All they keep saying is  order a second dress, I tried to explain to them that not everyone has an endless pot of money. I had to save for my daughters prom dress and she was so excited,now she is heartbroken and I feel helpless. I would suggest staying well clear if you don't want the stress and the agrow from this company, they are a complete joke."

( Thursday afternoon ) . She told me I would have to pay another £30 plus next day delivery charge and when I get them to go through the same scenario of getting back to them then they will give me back my delivery charge . I wanted a refund as I want sure they would be here for weekend . She cut me off saying a replacement would be sent and could take 3 days .  4 days later I got an email not replacement saying the product was out of stock to please send old ones and it could take up to 30 days for refund .

"July 03, 2017",1,ASOS and DPD are one of the worse for customer service,"One of worst companies currently still allowed the trade. Also they delivery partner DPD are as bad as ASOS.NEVER in the future would I use of recommend ASOS.They don't not really do ""time delivery, express or NEXT day Delivery"" even if you purchase the yearly one off "" PremiumDeliveryService for £10"" even than DPD will let you down and ASOS won't do anything about it.They don't have a call centre. (big company like them and don't have it, some what trading standards should review)So basically, I've ordered my items with next day delivery.To be told by DPD, ASOS didn't send us the items in time for next day delivery. so it won't be delivery as promised by ASOS.Then i was told yes it will be delivered but the driver hasn't scanned the items today. then later on was told don't call us it will be delivered.Still wasn't so ended up spending over £100 shopping in london last minutes to ensure i have my items for my sisters wedding. Then the next day was told for sure it will be sent today and LIAM (works behalf of CEO of DPD) so as it was the wedding day i selected please deliver to 136 and we will be out. only then to be sent a messaged items signed and delivered to 142. 142 no one by the name of kev lives there and they haven't received the item. funny thing they were all at work during the time of delivery. DPD said for you us to investigation you are not my Customer please pick up with ASOS. Rang ASOs but they don't have call centre to messaged on twitter and FACebook only to be told please send us your details when they have received over 20 emails from me. then ASOs said they can't refund in time can't reimburse me and will speak to DPD about items however i;ve sent them all the emails from DPD.Both companies and FUKING dogs."

Last month there was a problem, i had ordered 2 shoes (which was pack save, pay for 1 but get 2) They had forgotten to send one pair. I only recieved one pair. I got so sad. I sent a mail to customer care, the same they respond, and without any proof and questions, they immideitly sent the other pair too and they apologized. they were sooo quick to correct their mistakes. Btw their delivery is soooo quick. In delivery settings, it is always shown that goods will be arrived in almost 2 weeks (exluding weekends). Howevery, they always arrive in 6 days. And i dont even live in Europe, i live in Asia"
"July 01, 2017",5,Good customer service,"I ordered a watch wich was faulty. Customer service replied within 5 minutes, said they would return my money and that I could dispose the watch. 5 stars."
"July 01, 2017",1,Appalling customer service,"Wish I could give less! My delivery was given an hour long slot, I stayed back half an hour from work only for it to not arrive. I then went online to find a contact number for ASOS to check where my delivery was as my office has closed and there was no way for them to deliver it. There was no such number. I went through all the information online about what to do if your delivery didn't arrive, as my office is closed on a Saturday I opted for the delivery to be rerouted to a local shop for collecting the next day and was informed that I'd get a text to tell me what time it was ready to collect at 12pm and the next day. All seemed pretty simple. By 3pm the next day still nothing so I sent an email through the account section on the website, didn't hear back. By this point I'm getting really frustrated, not only have I wasted time by staying back at work but now my Saturday is being taken up chasing them for a response, I needed the delivery for my holiday and only had limited time.  So I found them on Facebook and saw that their messages are replied to instantly, great I thought, no reply hours later. So I posted directly on their page and commented on their posts asking for a reply, I then saw loads of other people with the same issue. Funnily enough when there was something in the public domain I got a reply! Basically telling me to wait until 10pm as that's when they deliver up until, this is a joke right? The shop is shut, it's impossible to deliver it now plus where is my explanation as to why it wasn't delivered in the first place? Then comes the waiting for the next response, when the waiting gets too much I then have to post on their page again before I get any response. Basically I'm getting nowhere so I ask for a phone call, I'm then told I've been put in a que, still no phone call by 10.30pm. I'm also having another conversation with them on email, these guys are telling me in might not be delivered until Monday and the social media crew are saying Sunday! They are absolutely clueless, their answers are generic and there's no solutions or explanations being offered. ASOS retrain all of your staff and get a call centre so you can actually manage your complaints, looks like you get enough of them!"

They would also not send the product back to me. AKA they stole from me DO NOT buy from this site.
"June 29, 2017",2,Prom dress problems,"Bought my prom dress from here and the dress arrived on time and was beautiful. Upon turning around, there was a huge rip in the lace on the back of the dress, which looked as though the fabric had been singed off as there's no fabric in the middle of the hole to even allow the ability to sew it back together. It's unfathomable how this passed quality control as it is blatantly obvious there is a huge fault with the dress. Also, returns and a new shipment take 7 days which means (if on time) the dress will arrive on prom day which isn't a chance I want to take so I'm going to have to source elsewhere at a higher price. Huge inconvenience and would've been a 5* rating if the dress wasn't defective."

"June 28, 2017",1,Asos has gone down the pan.,"After being a loyal customer and ordering from Asos for over a decade now, it seems the service is lacking immensely. From sending incorrect items on a regular basis to not delivering nextday orders, its very frustrating and disappointing as most orders are gifts for others.Asos no longer appreciates premier Account holders. No loyalty to long term, regular customers. Constantly disappointed!!! Asos has lost a loyal customer."
"June 28, 2017",1,truly awful customer care - completely untrustworthy,"truly awful customer care, social media team dont seem to have a clue, just sending cut and paste answers with no follow up. Refunds arent made despite proof of postage and evidence of receipt of items at their warehouse. Clothing items are sent out damaged or so creased they are totally unwearable. There seems to be no recourse and its impossible to contact anyone that seems to know how to resolve issues."

"June 27, 2017",1,You will not get refunded,"I purchased numerous (upwards of 20) pieces from asos. Due to size/ fit, I had to return many items. Simple enough to return the item, but forget getting a refund. I returned 4 packages but was refunded for only 3. It's impossible to get a customer service rep to respond, and when they do, they expect you to do the work (I sent back all order/payment confirmations + my postal receipt + their acknowledgment of receipt of 4 the packages. Not worth it. I lost a few hundred dollars with no apparent recourse."
"June 26, 2017",1,Beware!!!,Ordered a swimsuit bottom but instead was sent a top in the same print but a random size. Having a very top heavy body at 34ff this was the worst possible scenario for me. To make matters worse asos was the only place claiming to have the matching bottom when clearly they did not so now I have 2 tops (one that fits from amazon and one that does not from asos) I tried to login to my account to rectify the situation and asos has now locked me out of it saying I have an incorrect password when I know that is not the case. They do not have a phone number to contact them so there is literally no way to fix my order because without logging in I have no order number. I will NEVER be ordering from them again. Thank god I only paid 14 for the bottom. Beware!!  Do not give them your money. They Claim to have items you desire at a great price but what they actually do is take ur money and then send you whatever they want

When nothing happened for another couple of weeks, I got in contact again, and was refunded despite the missing package.If anything, customer support could be a little quicker but that's not a huge concern for me. My only advice is that I would warn anyone returning an order to Asos not to use the Hermes free collection service and to try the Doddle drop off or other service instead.Overall helpful and very accommodating of my repeated emails due to forgotten details. Thanks a lot!"

I either need to send them back for a refund or go to a seamstress to have them altered.The dresses are always too long and it's not as though I'm short - I'm 5ft7in.I've bought 2 dresses recently that look like a normal skater on the pic but when I get the dress it's more like a ballgown with all the underskirts/layers.
"June 22, 2017",1,If I could leave less than  one star I …,"If I could leave less than  one star I would. Returned an item on the 9th, tracking shows them receiving it on the 12th. Countless appeals to them about why I haven't got a refund, only to be told they are busy, pass it on to returns team, will hear back at some point, and that they haven't received it yet. The tracking proves otherwise. Never had such a frustrating problem with a shop in my life. No customer service, they don't really provide answers and when you push them to get an answer they don't respond. No phone number to contact on, only social media and email, they tend to ignore most of what you ask. You get an initial response to send over details to help but then no further help and no answers. Frustrated and angry doesn't cover it. Would not use again. It doesn't matter whether or not you are busy, you can't treat customers the way you are doing."
"June 21, 2017",2,VERY disappointed,"I'm very disappointed with my experience ordering clothes on Asos.comSometimes I waited more than a week for my order and sometimes only a few days.But once the order arrived it was always a big disappointment. I've had clothes that looked nothing like the picture on the website, things that were actually broken, etc. What most annoyed me recently was how wildly the sizes vary on this particular website. I know that when I have a size S at H&M, I will not have the same size at Zara but the sizes at asos are ridiculous. I ordered a bikini from the bigger bust collection thing and it wouldn't have fit someone that has size 70A! It looked like it was meant for children. Of course I sent my order back and now I've been waiting forever for them to send my money back. I would recommend ordering on asos only if you have already seen the product in real life and know what size you need. Also, if you are a student with not a lot of money like me, don't pay via paypal!! You will wait for your money forever and you will have to live on pizza for the rest of the month!"

They informed me last week that you have not yet received my return, yet my track n trace shows me you have already accepted my return Thursday 8-6. I have read on your website that there are some delays with the returns and that this can take up to 3 additional business days, we have now long surpassed that. BASICALLY DON'T ORDER HERE BECAUSE THEY WON'T GIVE YOU BACK THE MONEY FOR YOUR REFUND"

"June 18, 2017",1,Don´t ship to Switzerland - anger with costums!,"Attention: DON’T ORDER TO SWITZERLANDA few weeks ago I ordered some dresses for an upcoming wedding to Switerland, however, I could not keep any of them. On its Website Asos announces that they include already customs costs in their deliveries but nevertheless I got an invoice of the swiss customs for my asos order. I contacted the client service but the contact via email was terribly slow due to “too many requests at the same time”. Lastly, I ended up using the Live Chat on the website and I chattet with Jaqueline from the staff. I forwarded all the official customs documents to her and after contacting the “specialist department” she assured me of the cost absorption on my credit card.Now I am getting a new email from the asos service – again after reconfirmation with the “specialist department” – that they cannot do anything more for me and they redecided to not take over the costs from the invoice anymore. After few more requests from my side with reference to the chat pointed me to the custom office and that was it for them.It´s quite sad that an upcoming company established in ONLINE commerce is apparently not able to ship their goods and to help their customs. I personally find the reaction from asos upon my request uncooperative and brash, since they explicitly announce on their internet page that customs fees are already included (which is obviously not the case) and secondly a employee from asos assured the refund of costs to me already. I feel betrayed and I am stuck on a customs bill."

I waited until my size was available and when it finally was I bought it and everything was fine. Then I receive an email that I didnt pass a 'security check' (even though the payment went through just fine) and they needed my ID and proof of address. I was at work and I was able to give that to them within 10 minutes! I passed the stupid check but it wasn't enough.They cancelled my order and said I'd have to do it again. Now the dresses I wanted are no longer available.They 'took my money' and it'll take 10 business days to get back to my account.Basically, I'm f*cked. Now I have no money, no dresses and no time to fix it before the wedding. Plus, their customer service is horrible! It's the same as talking to a robot. They don't answer any of your questions and just 'hope you appreciate'. A joke and a waste of time.DONT BUY HERE!"

When the order arrived, I was very disappointed with the quality and poor fit of the clothes so I sent 4 of the 7 items back.The order arrived in the warehouse just 1 day after I had sent it. I contacted customer service 2 weeks after this date to inquire when my money would be refunded. They said that they had not received the order back…. After showing them that they did, it took 2 days for them to send a confirmation email.To my dismay, the discount that was applied to the items of clothes that I had kept was transferred onto the ones that were sent back. Consequently, affecting the amount that will be returned to me! Also, they claim that it can take 21 working days to refund your money. Why on earth does it take that long???Considering the excellent service at Zalando and other online stores… I will never ever shop with ASOS again. Buyer BEWARE!!!!!"

There is no phone number to call and I have no faith that they will ""find"" my order. I had a dress I needed to wear for a wedding- I'm 9 months pregnant and cannot find anything to wear last minute for this-- that was why I used their site in the first place. There is a complete lack of compassion from ASOS-- Don't waste your money."
"June 12, 2017",1,Do NOT shop here,"Hi all, just so you are aware... I ordered a big load of clothes from Asos in May and as I spent over a certain amount I got a £30 discount. Delivery came and 2 pairs of the jeans didn't fit but I really wanted one pair and needed them for a special occasion so rather than sending them back and risking them not getting sent back to me on time I just bought them again with next day delivery. I then sent back the two pairs of jeans which didn't fit from my original order and asked for a refund to find that they only wanted to refund me £35 which was the cost of one of the pairs of jeans (the ones which I had reordered a couple of days later to get in the right size) but the other pair which were £30 (the discount which I originally got) was not going to be refunded because they said I was now under the spend limit to receive the discount! I sent them an email and said that it's ridiculous as I have reordered the jeans and spent the money at the store again AND had to pay extra for next day delivery which was something stupid like and extra £5! They then emailed back and said no this is how we work with the ""terms and conditions"". Bear in mind they can see on my account I have spent thousands at Asos over the years you'd think they wouldn't treat a loyal customer like this. Anyway so I emailed back and said try and understand... if I sent back both pairs of jeans... and said I want one refunded and one replaced in a different size...I would have had £35 refunded and still have the other pair of jeans! But at the moment you have £30 of my money/ my pair of jeans which you are technically stealing!? So I have now asked them to send me back the other pair of jeans in a different size if they won't refund me but I haven't had a response yet... let's hope someone with half a brain replies! Just to warn you all, I won't be shopping at Asos again that's for sure!"

It's just how online shopping should be  . . .The only reason for not having the full 5 stars from me is because their online filters take you back to page one of your search which, if you're on page 12 is a real pain, to be taken back simply because you stopped to look at/ purchase something {this is done on a PC not a phone}. I did email them about this in 2015 so I hope they've sorted that by now, once they do it'll be a 5 stars from me."

Why bother allowing people submit an inquiry if you never follow up? I was told by two different reps that they would look into the status of my missing order, and never heard back. Had they at least bothered to follow up, I would not be leaving a negative review. I'm now out well over a hundred dollars, and while it's not a huge loss, I'm still incredibly annoyed. I am by no means a fussy customer. I have received incorrect orders in the past, and have had orders cancelled when an item was out of stock, and have never been as irritated as I am by the sheer lack of customer service. I will not be purchasing from ASOS going forward. Many of their items can be bought elsewhere and sometimes for less, so why bother with a company that doesn't value its customers."

And the Item is nowhere to be found, not even as a ""sold out"" item which I actually come across often. This time I contacted the customer service as I am getting annoyed by this practice. They actually claim that they removed the item due to it being out of stock, and could not give me any information of the Item. I find that really uncomfortable because it does seem like there is a tendency to use popular products to lure people on the page without them actually having the products placed in the ""adds"" . It is a nuisance since I used a lot of time to find the item. I hope others will speak up as well if you experience this as it is indecent marketing practice. If this was a physical store who couldn't provide any proof of the item used in an ad, they would have broken the law.. and these standards shouldn't be allowed online either.."

So I paid, obviously I lost my discount and they ruined my surprise for his birthday!!!!

My skirt Isn't arriving as they have taken the skirt back in place of giving me £30 off my original order and refunded me the £2 difference. Serious how is this even possible! So asos draw in customers with money off codes/offers but then take it back off us just as quick if the opportunity is there to do so.I didn't want a refund! I wanted an exchange so I'm honouring my side of the terms and conditions set by asos when taking out the offer. I can't believe this is allowed to happen.Disgusting Will never order from Asos again"

"June 02, 2017",2,Lost customer,"Had an account at Asos for a while and shopped without problems until I received an email telling me I need to change the password on the account as there had been 'suspicious activity'. I followed the instruction they gave me which didn't work as when I tried to log in again I just got a page telling me the accounts blocked and I need to contact Customer Services, so I contacted customer services and finally received a reply telling me I need to reply to the original email I'd received, did that and again after another wait I received another reply telling me I need to reply to another email which I've never had (!!??) . . . Both emails I also requested what activity had occurred and this was ignored. There are way to many other places to shop online without this hassle, so that's what I did instead and will be doing in future . . ."
"June 01, 2017",1,This company is clearly still getting …,"This company is clearly still getting their act together in Australia and I would not recommend them over other similar online retailers (e.g., theiconic.com.au, catchoftheday.com.au, ozsale.com.au, etc.). Here is one of several examples and TEN steps: 1) I ordered a pair of shoes at 30% off. 2) They arrive obviously broken (not checked by anyone before sending). 3) I print off return slip, drive and drop over to AusPost register post them back to ASOS. 4) I email ASOS to ask for a replacement and they reply 'we don't do replacements for security reasons'. I email them and tell them ""all i want is the shoes i originally ordered unbroken."" A few emails of to-and-fro ensue. 5) They tell me by that time they will give me a refund when the broken shoes arrive and that i can re-order the same shoes online as per a new purchase. 6) In the meantime, i am $115 out of pocket, have to waste more time shopping online from scratch, and then attempt to buy the original shoes but the 30% off sale has ended. I email them to ask if I can get them at the sale price and they say 'no, only 10% off (who knows why they didn't just honor the original price here). 7) More emails to-and-fro. They agree to give me the shoes at the original price and then they tell me they're now 'out of stock'. Arrrggghh!!! By this time i was angry and had wasted so much time that the true value of the shoes was sitting at about $115 in money and about $200 in my time. ($300+).  8) I then agree to getting a refund and resolve never to go through this company again. I then purchase the same shoes in person at Rebel sport for cheaper. 9) All is well and i'm awaiting my refund until a week or so later some well-intended fool saw that my shoe stock at ASOS had been replenished and decided to re-send the original shoe replacement  without asking me or informing me. I then get an email saying 'item sent' and re-contact ASOS to tell them i no longer want the shoes as i've purchased some new ones and was (as per previous email agreement) awaiting my refund because a) they couldn't honor the original price, b) my size was out of stock, and c) they only refund and do not replace for security reasons. They apologise to me via email and tell me that i will not get a refund until the second batch of replacement shoes arrive at my house, and i return them by first i printing the return slip, and going again to AusPost office, registering the item, and sending it back to ASOS. And so the merry-go-round continues until i threatened to post a poor online review (which is why i'm writing this). 10) The outcome? They just notified me that the replacement shoes have now reached their warehouse and that i will get a refund in up to 10 business days nearly one month after the original online purchase was made. In summary: So i've lost about 2.5 to 3 hours of time, been $115 out of pocket, and 20 or so emails and x2 trips to the post office for absolutely no item. Clearly, this wasn't just a once off. This company is marred by by miscommunication, outdated returns policies, and adversarial customer ""service"" that penalises the customer for receiving a faulty item. I would not purchase here until they get their act together."
"June 01, 2017",1,Order no,Order no. 266462730Order has been processing since Monday (29.5.17). Even with standard delivery I am stunned to think that I have had no update since then - never had this sort of poor experience from any other online business. Needless to say the money was taken out of my account in double quick time. Last ordered from them in 2015 - this 'business' has gone massively backwards since then. Avoid at all costs people.I have emailed the so-called CEO Nick Beighton (that's NickB at asos dot com) for any disgruntled customers who are interested. I shall keep you all closely informed of his response accordingly.
"June 01, 2017",3,"Quality not Always Great, but Worth a Browse","Have placed many orders with ASOS and have had mixed opinions on items received. Tend to find the quality of some of the brands isn't very good,  but others are fine. They are, however,  an easy company to deal with returns and find that money is refunded pretty quick.  They also have a large selection of Tall range clothing, although most of which is a bit 'unique ' in it's design for my wardrobe.  Always worth checking their site though."

"May 30, 2017",4,Good and bad,OK. They have average quality clothing in their basic range and their returns are expensive and take a long time. I do LOVE their denim range though.
"May 29, 2017",1,BEWARE,"Think twice before you order from ASOS, as what you receive might not be what you've actually ordered.Long story short, they advertise clothes with other clothes on top or underneath and don't state this anywhere on the site which leads to customer being confused and order an item that doesn't match the reality.It happened once this winter when I ordered a knit dress supposedly with a mesh part underneath but I only received the knit part, however I didn't bother sending it back even though I was annoyed by the way they tricked me into buying something that I believed looked different. Now we are a few months later when I order a nice slip dress with a mesh part on top, however I only received the mesh part. When I contacted support (as believed they've sent a faulty item), someone confirmed that the item is faulty indeed and promised to send me another one. Today I received the other one only to find out that they've sent just the mesh part again. Annoyed, I contacted their incompetent and rude live chat support ( I am a live chat support agent myself and I found the customer service unacceptable). This time they confirm that the dress is actually the mesh part only and after I ask how am I meant to wear a see through dress only and more importantly WHY do they advertise 2 different items and make it look like it's one whole piece and don't state this anywhere on the page they say ""I'm sorry but since this is the right dress there's nothing we can do"". I ask why do they present the mesh dress with another one underneath they reply that ""obviously their models cannot wear a mesh dress without clothes underneath for obvious reasons"", however if you go on their website and search for 'mesh dress' you can find plenty of other similar dresses presented with the model wearing just underwear underneath. When I asked to speak to a manager/supervisor of course I was asked ""what outcome am I looking for"" and of course I wasn't given a chance to speak to someone in charge.  Now I have to return the dress and pay for post taxes as I live outside the UK and HOPEFULLY they refund me (as I see other customers comments I might not be lucky enough to receive my money back). So the OUTCOME I'm looking for here is to warn people to think twice before and WHAT they order from the website."

"May 27, 2017",1,Asos seem like a great site to order …,"Asos seem like a great site to order from but theyre actually quite sneaky in certain aspects so just beware before ordering. I wouldnt bother ordering anything fragile as it most likely will be broken and you will have to return it. I once ordered £250 of goods from the site and they were totally crushed into a really small box, which I find totally inadequate and thoughtless when you're spending that kind of money. The customer service come across as being annoying and very false, plus it costs about 20p/minute to phone.What has made me leave a negative review however is that I recently placed an order and used a promo code they had which was 10 pounds off when you spend 75. Unfortunately one of the items was damaged and I had to return it, This item i had already ordered once before and was damaged hence why I asked for it to be refunded rather than replaced. After sending back I was only refunded 15 pounds rather than 25 as they deducted the whole of the promo code from the amount paid back to me. I contacted customer service and they would not agree to have somebody in a higher customer service position contact me about it. If I had known this would happen I never would have used that promo code I would have used my student discount.Even after explaining I have spent thousands of pounds with asos over the last few years the advisor would not get anyone else to contact me. Be warned of what seems like a good deal as it may end up not being."

Do not tell ASOS customer care if you get a different item, they will keep your money hostage ""until they receive it back, it is their policy not to refund before then"". Now I'm praying it doesn't get lost in the mail so I can get my $80 back. They will advertise sold out items on their site."

"May 26, 2017",1,wife's birthday,Ordered few items for my wife's birthday on 22/05/17 for next day delivery as we are premium customers. Received a confirmation from dpd on 23/05/2017 for delivery. Never turned up. Contacted them through live chat and was then told I'd have to wait 4 working days for them to investigate. My wife then called there customer service team to see what was happening then they resent the package out on the 23/05/2017 for delivery on the 24/05/2017 and were told we will get a confirmation for delivery. We didn't get a confirmation so it is now the 26/05/2017 and no delivery. Just spoke to customer services and they are quite appalling to be fair they don't know what's going on and as a sorry gave us a 10% discount off our next order. Don't think I'll be ordering again as her birthday has been ruined along with the fact I've spent over £150 so asked for a refund instead because of all the waiting at least can give her the money and she can get what she wants herself from somewhere else. Only to be told will take 3-5 working days to get a refund. Pathetic service. Been customers for at least 6-7years now never had an issue with them but seems like there starting to get lazy. Be warned guys it's an absolute nightmare sorting issues out with Asos. One more customer lost.

"May 25, 2017",1,TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"ASOS has repeatedly sent me the wrong size for my order then tried to blame it on me. They keep passing me off to different customer service personal who say I ordered the wrong size, despite the fact that my receipt CLEARLY states that I ordered the right size. I even provided screen shots.They are a UK website, so I ordered a UK 32G. They keep sending me US 32Fs. They referred me to their sizing guide, which didn't help their cause because it states ""ASOS own brand bikini tops come in UK sizing, please see chart below for conversion to EU and US sizes"". Therefore, if I order a 32G, I expect to receive a 32G, no matter where I live. End of story.I tried to refund and re-order as they suggested, but they STILL managed to send me the wrong size. TWICE!Yesterday, I asked to speak to a manager. They said they would have someone call me this morning. Still waiting! Pretty sure they are blowing me off.All I want is to receive my order in the correct size. THAT'S ALL. I don't understand why this has to be so difficult!!If you are looking to receive your order exactly as you ordered it, I would NOT recommend doing business with this company.Update: Only after I started posting public reviews on Facebook did they finally call me. The guy one the phone was super rude and condescending, saying I was wrong because I lived in America. What it came down to is they didn't have the size that was advertised as I had ordered, so they figured they'd just send me a smaller size instead. Get bent!"

"May 24, 2017",4,Lovely quality and affordable price only let down by its delivery,"I love ASOS designs and styles, the quality is good and it's fashion lines cover all trends with an eye to their customers creating looks that are both chic and unique.You cannot fault them on affordability and design, and the Tall option is an invaluable reason for my choice to use them because I have long arms and legs and often suffer with a lack of choice because of sleeve and leg length.I have had three orders from them and usually delivery is a little slower than other companies online that I use, which is probably why I don't use them more.ASOS is reliable in itself on quality and price, and I have talked to customer service on one occasion and they dealt with my problem quickly and politely, but as many companies on this forum ,and retailing in the UK online , it suffers from not making the choice to invest in a more reliable delivery company to deliver products. When Hermes is used , dependent on which agent gets your order , it can make or break your reputation with your first order, and although I am willing to take extra time to make my order earlier with a company whose products I like because I know their delivery partner can be slow, should I have too ?ASOS , just like other good companies with unreliable delivery , should take note of the delivery companies they use and not go for the cheaper option with private couriers because it is not their products but this service which damages their reputation for home shoppers.Thank you for the styles , just sped up your snail mail."
"May 24, 2017",1,"Hopeless staff, poor comms, wrong item...","I ordered a dress, and so therefore after my online purchase it should have been marked as ‘sold' in the warehouse or on a computer. ASOS sent the wrong dress – so, the original dress I ordered should still have been in the warehouse? This is obvious?However, within a couple of hours, they were unable to replace the order they had sold me as it was ‘sold out’ – hm!! So, either someone cannot be bothered to do their job and check warehouse availability as my dress should still be there….as it was never sent out, remember they sent me the WRONG one…OR….ASOS sent the wrong dress on purpose and resold my dress, AFTER I had ordered, it to someone else.Either way, this sounds very dodgy to me, and such terrible customer service.Added to all this, given their mistakes, and leaving me without the dress – they offered a laughable 10% discount off of my next order.Congrats to ASOS, they managed to add considerable insult to injury and enormous error by their gang of idiots in the post and packing department.This sequence of events means that the individual matters not one bit to ASOS, and their staff give scant regard for any order. Plus, nobody really knows what is in or out of the warehouse.Perhaps in next ASOS training exercises with staff, they might like to start with “this is a black dress with flowers and lace and this is a blue dress with white spots, see how they differ?” Because, if an online store cannot even get that right……….."

I returned via the collect+ at tesco so they do this via paypoint.Even they said if I have the barcode number from the return label they can locate a duplicate but Asos don't keep a record of this.convenient way to make more !!

It was either that or they arrive 2 days after the wedding.. 3. when we reached the end of the conversation (and by end I mean they stopped talking to me),  they said they'd get back to me in 72 hours..

From my experience of being on the chat for more than an hour nobody seemed to be able to help 'Clear your cache and cookies' was a solution I got 3 times when I had explained I had already tried that.When you compare to other companies they are good but just need to work on the more personal support as other than that product variety, returns and delivery are really good."

They won't refund me despite me telling them that the signature has been forged and the driver admitting that there was no answer at my door when he tried to deliver the item.

Since i did not go out of my way to repackage the item and go to the posthose, on my busy day, they refused to refund my money or send a replacement. This is 100% ASOS' fault, why do i have to be the one to fix this by going out of way, instead of just fixing it themselves? I did not receive the item i ordered and they refuse to refund my money. Terrible customer service."
"May 15, 2017",1,Asos is HORRIBLE,"I purchased a dress from Asos 4/2017. I did not get my item but they got my money. The only way to speak to someone  is in an online chat. I contacted them several times, in April , and was told they would look into it. I contacted them again, in early May, in an online chat, and was told  they never were contacted about my missing package. I was then told AGAIN, they would look in to it. Lesson learned, don't order from a company that doesn't have a contact number. Also, anything over a $140 needs to be sent by UPS only, so it can be signed for. I will never shop with them again and advise other not to as well."
"May 14, 2017",5,1000's of items,"Always great and so much choice, if you can't find it here, I don't know where you can! Prices are a bit higher,but it reflects in the quality. Quick and easy returns, I take them to my local Asda and they send it back :)"

"May 12, 2017",1,BULLSHIIT COMPANY!!!,"There were so many things I wanted to get from Asos but were out of stock. I contacted them to ask when they will be back in stock and they said they don't restock because they ""like to offer you new and exciting products regularly"". THAT IS NO EXCUSE, you can restock and still add ""new and exciting products""... Absolutely no consideration for the people that want specific items."

"May 11, 2017",1,the worst experience ever,"the worst experience everthe worst experience ever, two orders not delivered. Delay of reimbursement, and ask for my account statement. They send packages/orders with the value over 150 Euro unregistered, without tracking number and are not able to explain where the package is or why it is not delivered yet, just suggest to wait.. I now doubt that the orders had been ever shipped.."

WORST customer service EVER, i thought back in Africa where i come from they have the worst customer service, but apparently they have a competitor now ASOS.NEVER BUY FROM THEM.

"May 10, 2017",1,Asos is horrible!!,"Asos is horrible!!! If I could give them a zero I would. It got to the point where I was so sick of repeating myself (apparently, different people respond to your message each time, and don't bother looking through the thread, and frustrate the heck out of customers) that I wrote a detailed blog post and uploaded all of their ridiculous responses, and proof that my package never arrived, and was actually delivered to another city! And they won't refund me."
"May 09, 2017",1,No Responsibility for Their OWN Mistake,"No Responsibility for Their OWN MistakeI'm pinching the title from a previous disgruntled client - I think they're AWFUL!!Ordered a pair of DUNE wedding shoes - DUNE card enclosed said there should be spare heels tips - they weren't. The packaging was also poor; very little soft tissue paper and no soft storage bag - plus the box was damaged.I made enquiries and basically the inconvenience was to be all min. They suggested - as they had ABSOLUTELY NO SPARE HEEL TIPS! [??] - that I return  my shoes, get a full refund then re-order . With my wedding 8 weeks away! Why should I run that risk of no replacement stock when heel tips could have been posted in a jiffy bag?In summary, they've got no replacement shoes as well as no heel tips! But still they suggest I return the shoes and get a full refund - and re-order!! Bunch of numpties with NO CLUE about customer service...oh I forgot! I CAN get a 10% discount - whoopy-do! I'll pass thanks!"

When I asked to return and get refund for all expenses, including import duty, they said that I have to be responsible for import charge by myself though they make the mistake. At the end, the customer care service recommended me to  use corresponding emails with them as proof with custom office for tax refund. This is so unprofessional. I will not buy anything from ASOS again, ever."
"May 08, 2017",5,I love buying from ASOS,"I love buying from ASOS. I am a plus size woman and this is one of the only stores that offers fashionable, trendy, and well priced clothes in my size. There's a 10% discount for students. Packages have always arrived on time and I've never had to return anything because it always fits. Some of the clothes have lasted me 2+ years."

Friday should have been my latest delivery. I was then told it would arrive Saturday. It did not. Then I was told Monday. Once again it did not. Now I ask again, and they cannot even tell me when it will be delivered. I am seriously beginning to wonder if when it does arrive, will I have the clothes I ordered in the box. Extremely disappointed, this was my first time ordering from Asos. I will not be making the same mistake again."
"May 08, 2017",2,I ordered a few bikini tops for a trip …,"I ordered a few bikini tops for a trip to Mexico and I received the wrong item. I found that the only way to contact the company is through social media which is very annoying, slow, and impersonal. They sent the right item months later- too late for my trip, therefore I returned the item. It has been longer than 2 months and I have yet to see a penny of my $150 despite the communication online. Don't expect to be treated like a priority if you have issues with an order, the customer service is horrible at ASOS, despite the cute clothes. The worst part is that I have not felt assured that I will receive my money- they are well obscured behind the walls of social media, and it seems they never deliver a sincere message. Sometimes I don't even know if I am speaking to an actual person- it was a horrible experience and I won't shop here again. Who knows if I'll get my money."

"May 06, 2017",1,Bloody terrible,"Bloody terrible, I've only purchased from asos 3 times out of three years and each time they've managed to mess up my order.Shipping from UK to Aus meant I had to wait a month for each order to arrive. Subsequently, they have either given me the wrong item or mis delivered the item. Then they have the audacity to only offer me a refund once they have received the item back.Their representatives are also rude."
"May 05, 2017",1,DO NOT BUY FROM ASOS,"DO NOT BUY FROM ASOS, after waitng for my order the time it was supposed to take, it was showing delivered on the carrier's link,however when i contacted ASOS, I was informed the package had been lost, and whenasked for a refund, they refused, and informed a new package will be sent and i would have to send it back to them and wait for a refund. doesn't make sens. I will never use ASOS again,they dont even have professional people online."
"May 04, 2017",5,Use ASOS with confidence,"It was my first time when I used a site to make my shoppings and ASOS was there for me. Great experience on their site, each item is well described with photos and models. My order arrived in time even earlier and I had no problems with them."

However, my most recent experience has really put me off and I want to make sure other people are aware of the bad customer service if your order does not go as planned. One of the items in my order was actually out of stock and was refunded. I only know about this because of a Paypal notification. I received no email from asos and when I enquired about it, all I got was excuses and insincere apologies. Nothing was done and I was ver disappointed, particularly when so many other large online companies go above and beyond. If you have a difficult order or are worried about something going wrong, don't order with asos. Stick to simple stuff only, their customer service is terrible."

I didn't blame them just want them to start an inquiry with UPS.  They refused because I have not checked with the post office?  What?  The post office has nothing to do with this.

"May 01, 2017",1,BE AWARE OF RETURNS AND CHANGES.,"As i was treated very poorly in first trying to put in an order with an on-site-promo code.. They had technical issues, so the add was showing even though the campaign had expired. After 45min of explaining i finally got a 10% promo. Now that i wonna make a size change due to the size guide not showing correct convertions for the ""Asos brand shoe"" i cannot get the same discount as originally."
"May 01, 2017",1,"Ripped while putting on, dress shrunk to t-shirt length",1. Knee length dress shrunk to a t-shirt length ugly looking top after first wash. Cannot be worn. 2. Lavish Alice brand body ripped while putting it on. 3. Asos PREMIUM trousers broke in first wash. I would expect those to last at least four to five months but this purchase was a complete waste of money. Having contacted Asos customer service several times I still haven't heard back from them and it's been over five weeks now. Stay away from the seller and spend your money with a company that does not fool you.
"April 30, 2017",1,Awful Company - very dishonest,"Awful Company to deal with, I seriously would not give them another penny. They have some good brands and the delivery is good as I had their yearly membership. Their own items are poor quality and fit and do not look good. Ifyou encounter a problem do not expect them to resolve it! They are very dishonest and the custome is always wrong. I am substantially out of pocket due to them.  They stopped replying to my complaint. When they did respond they were just rude."
"April 30, 2017",3,1 wear clothing,Wacky designed clothing at fairly cheap prices. A bit like Target altho cheaper made and disposable. More like 1 wear items that shrink when you use a hot wash and too much detergent.
"April 30, 2017",1,Never got my order,Never got my order. Customer specialist doesn't even reply to me. Very dissatisfied and disappointed. I just lost my money and my time.

I hope you're well!Sadly the following items are now out of stock at the time of processing, so I’m not able to send you a replacement. No need to worry at all, I’ve refunded xxGBP to the Delta you used to place your order.I really hope that this has helped and you're now able to enjoy the rest of your day!Charlie""Hey Charlie, a few points for you:* My order was meant to be delayed, NOT cancelled. * Why did it take a week to work this out? What kind of customer service is this? You are misleading people.*I don't even have a Delta card!* I also have an issue with the ridiculously upbeat tone of your communication. ""I really hope that this has helped and you're now able to enjoy the rest of your day!"". I find this patronising and insulting.How about an APOLOGY to start with? And some sort of Compensation? I think Charlie better find another job. And you should all shop on another site."
"April 28, 2017",1,Recently the worst company to order online from,"I've been using Asos for years and have never had a problem. However my most recent order for a pair of shoes has made me completely change my mind about them. I was sent the wrong size so I emailed Asos and waited for a reply...inbetween I spoke to them on Asos chat and asked if they can send the right size sent out while I return the incorrect size as I needed the shoes for 2 days later, each person said within 48 hours I should get some news from them...30 hours later, still no sign of the replacement and still no email. If I had been the one making a mistake on the order I'm sure Asos wouldn't want me to make them wait 48 hours before a response. This is the first time I've come across a company who takes this long to sort out a mistake. I'm done with Asos and don't intend on using them again."
"April 27, 2017",5,Fantastic - Never had any problems,I've never had any problems with ASOS what so ever. I've bought items from them a million times and not once did I have any troubles of any kind. I've returned several packages and got a refund for all of them. Never had any pacakages wrong and always amazing quality.
"April 27, 2017",1,Don't bother with them,"Don't bother with them. Out of 2 different orders, first one item broke on the second time I wore it. Second order, they messed up paperwork for shipping, order was returned to them and refunded to me! And can't even reorder as it's now out of stock! My advice is to go somewhere else to shop."
"April 27, 2017",5,Best online Store,I have made so many orders from Asos over the last 6 years and I have never had any issues! Everything fits perfectly and I have never had to return or refund anything!! Shipping always comes when expected!!
"April 25, 2017",1,I don't even have the words to explain …,I don't even have the words to explain how horrible this company is. I tried to purchase one order and never again. I ordered 4 dresses. 3 of them were the wrong item. Then when I requested the items I had actually purchased they said they would send it right away so I could have it on time. However when I heard nothing I contacted them again and they said the dresses i ordered were out of stock. So now they said I need to return the dresses to get a refund. They didn't seem to care at all not even offering a discount on a next purchase or replacing the items with something else.I have returned all 4 dresses but no refund. They're now saying I have only returned one dress. It's a complete scam. Do not order from asos.
"April 24, 2017",5,I don't have a bad word to say about …,"I don't have a bad word to say about Asos. Customer service, delivery, returns and queries have never been a problem. They have gone above and beyond for me. The quality can be questionable sometimes but rarely and it's no hassle to send anything back and the refunds happen very quickly. Fantastic company"
"April 24, 2017",3,"Decent customer service, bad product quality!","Mix of good and bad experiences!More than once the QUALITY of the items was horrendous, I had to return them, but I honestly had no issues with refunds or customer service, just product quality of some items and misleading sizes on labels compared to actual fit!"
"April 24, 2017",1,Very poor quality dresses,Very poor quality dresses; look very cheap - returns took very long.. won't recommend at all
"April 23, 2017",1,The worst !!!!,They sent my package to the wrong address. Didn't send me a new one. My package was lost. Didn't get my outfit for a wedding I was invited to. They took long to answer to my email. Didn't even give me a store credit to apologize. Will never order from them again!!
"April 22, 2017",2,"Asos / Hermes collection - a joke, that isn't funny.","Booked a return collection with Hermes. Waited in from 8am to 8pm on a Saturday which was the window I was given. Wasted a whole day as they never turned up. When I contacted Asos to complain they told me to contact Hermes or rebook. (Hermes's website says in the event of complaints and non collection to call the retailer). There was a token apology and the agent was polite but no real sense of surprise or genuine disappointment. More a case of - ""oh, sorry about that, you'll just need to rebook"".  I finally got offered a 10% discount on new full priced items if i shopped again at asos in the next month - but that's just a ploy to get even more money out of you!! Furthermore this is not the first time this has happened. Last time the driver didn't show up on the day he was meant to and then left an angry voice message two days later when he finally decided to arrive  (and which hadn't been prearranged) demanding to know where we were. This shouldn't be happening ASOS and rather than just tell people to make new arrangements if it does - please do something proactive so that you have direct contact with drivers, can see where parcels and drivers are, can raise complaints or even better - just turn up when you say you will. Thanks for ruining my weekend and leaving me to sort out the mess."
"April 21, 2017",5,Always have a great experience,Always have a great experience. Even the one time that something went wrong it was handled very well.
"April 21, 2017",1,Really bad experience,"Really bad experience. After the order procedure they send the next day that on all the package customs and duty + shipping handling costs apply. I live in Brazil and normally the customs are only charged by the customs here in the country and not in the country where it is being sent from. The buying process appears to have free shipping, but it's a total scam. BE VERY CAREFULL WITH THIS SITE."
"April 21, 2017",4,I regularly use this website,"I regularly use this website. It's excellent. The setup of the website is good and easy to find what you are looking for. The products are good and there is always something you want. Delivery is good as well, have had a few problems over the years but everything has worked out and the costumer service is good as well. Returning items super easy. Overall always a good experience."
"April 20, 2017",1,"$200.00 dollars later, no tracking number, no parcel, no one cares.","Do not order from this place, I was looking for a dress for an event and found one that I loved at ASOS. I knew my event was coming up so I made sure to select a delivery date that would give me decent amount of time. Well, my delivery date came and went, when I DM'd ASOS to inquire, they said that my parcel had no tracking number. So let me get this straight .... you sent a $200.00 parcel from UK to Canada and didn't think you should use a shipping method with a tracking number?! I was told by them that I'd have to wait till May 5th before they will do anything about it.... that's 2.5 weeks from the delivery date that I had selected. Also, May 5th will be after my event.. No one seemed to care. No one offered to express a new one to me with tracking number, nothing. Pretty much, tough luck hopefully it gets to you on time. They got the money. Now it's not their issue.Seriously, $200.00 down, no dress and gonna have to rush to find something new to wear. DO NOT SHOP HERE!!"
"April 20, 2017",3,"Cute clothes, terrible customer service","They have a lot of very nice clothes and accessories by amazing brands, however their customer service sucks a**. Your order will most likely come after the guaranteed date. Otherwise, I do love their clothes but worry a lot about my orders never arriving."
"April 20, 2017",4,I've ordered regularly from ASOS,"I've ordered regularly from ASOS.  I love that the returns are so easy and free.  Shipping always ends up being free as well, which is awesome, being in Hawaii.  It does take a few weeks to get here, but it is coming from the opposite side of the world. Quality of the items can hit or miss but most are  really nice. Plus they are incredibly reasonably priced and there are some awesome sales too. The one bad thing is that returns can take more than a month or two to process, so don't expect your money back right away.  I had to contact customer service for them to realize that the returns had been made and then I had my money refunded."
"April 20, 2017",1,Cheap crap and down right outrageous customer service!,"Over the years I have used ASOS a fair amount, they used to be good. I refuse to use them anymore. The quality of their own brand goods has deteriorated quite drastically and the quality of the 'Brands' they stock has also taken a nose dive. I have on two occasions received the wrong items (either different size from what was ordered or a completely different item all together!). The final straw was when I ordered a birthday gift for a friend, I paid £7 for special delivery scheduled for a certain day. It never came. When I contacted ASOS they told me that the delivery had been made - so I contacted DPD the courier. They apologised and told me that the driver had failed to complete his deliveries on that route because his van had broken down (not great - but at least honest).  The item arrived 3 days late (well past my friends birthday). I posted it all back to them and sent an email asking for the delivery cost to be refunded also. It took 3 emails explaining the whole thing each time and screen shots of my conversation with DPD for ASOS to concede and refund me everything. At no point however did they apologise or explain why their information was wrong compared with DPD."
"April 20, 2017",5,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"Shop with ASOS regularly. So far, so good! No complaints. Love the reward scheme! Large range, good quality! 👍🏻"
"April 20, 2017",5,Love ASOS,"Not sure since when they provide tracking number for international delivery (at least I got mine not sure about others). It usually takes less than 2 weeks to arrive at Malaysia which is quite fast and it never gone missing (touchwood). Website is easy to navigate, it accepts credit cards and paypal as well. Customer service is alright for me. Definitely one of my favourite online store :)"
"April 19, 2017",1,Horrendous company - shop elsewhere if you can.,"Customer service level has got to be one of the lowest in the UK and most disrespectful I have experienced.Canceling orders without apologizing to customer's for the fact they have oversold a product is just absolutely ridiculous and for me is probably is just one of the many problems I have had in the past couple of months.Access to there staff via the online facebook and emails is for me rendered useless. You have to wait weeks for a reply and when they do reply, they change agents every single time. So in reality not one single agent knows what you are talking about because they don't have the previous messages. This can string out a basic request for a refund into month's, in my case 3 months.They do not really have a system in place to actually compensate customers for the time they waste and genuinely could not care less about there customers as they only care about money and for me have got to be one of the most ruthless and soulless companies out there. The fact that they hide their customer service phone number tells all for me.I recommend most friends to stay away from ASOS and look else where for products online.Shameful company."
"April 19, 2017",1,Horrible Customer Experience,"There was an issue with my order that I placed during a sale, when I approached them about the order the next day, they said ""no problem we can cancel the order and you can re-order it and you'll be all set!"". so they cancel it, and forgot to tell me that they wouldn't honor the discount sale code from yesterday so I lost the entire promotion. Super unprofessional. I don't suggest ordering clothes from them."
"April 18, 2017",1,Awful company,"Awful company - BEWARE I order 4 dresses. Going to a few weddings. Paid about £120 for the items. I returned the parcel with the pre-paid label.I cannot find the proof of postage receipt (yes it is my fault). I contacted Royal Mail and have been advised that ASOS will have the return number, as they post that with the order number when you receive it. ASOS is supposed to make a claim to Royal Mail as they paid for the postage!!!!!!!!!. Customer service is so BAD. They won't even look into. I'LL NEVER USE ASOS AGAIn, REALLY BAD COMPANY. I will dISCOURAGE anyone ordering anything..."
"April 16, 2017",5,I'm writing this review because I'm a …,"I'm writing this review because I'm a bit shocked by the rating ASOS has here. I've been a very happy customer for over a decade...I started ordering with ASOS back when it was called As Seen On Screen. I make at least one order per week. Customer service is excellent - I have tried via the contact page and facebook. Hermes returns are free and collect from your door so you don't have to lug returns back to the post office. Returns are very timely and can be expected within a few days. Excellent next day delivery that even comes on a Sunday. I normally order in the UK but I've also made orders whilst in Europe and haven't had any problems. Huge range of brands at many price points. Some of the cheaper items aren't the best quality but you get what you pay for so I don't know why people complain about that. I've referred so many of my friends to ASOS over the years because they are hands down one of the best retailers out there! I can think of many retailers with a lot to learn from ASOS. Overall, excellent service and I really hope ASOS continues to be successful because my wardrobe depends on it!"

"April 14, 2017",5,One of my favourite online retailers,"One of my favourite online retailers. I've been buying from ASOS for probably about 5 years and I'm honestly never disappointed. I like that there's such a wide variety of brands and styles available on the site. The house brand I find is pretty much always true to size, which is great considering returning things online to anywhere can be a hassle."
"April 13, 2017",5,Made my day,"Have been ordering quite a lot of items recently and even though I did return most of them (just because of personal reasons) I did love of it. ASOS do have a great range of different products and styles, the website is easy to use, sometimes items go off the stock quite quickly but I guess it is no ones fault really. Quality most of the time reflects the price, and refund are processed reasonably quickly. Recently needed to contact customer service in regards to delay on the refund and they were quick to respond and solve the issue. Also have received some treats as in Oreos and Lucozade with my recent orders which really made my day. Would strongly recommend their services"
"April 12, 2017",4,"Nice Bikini, Ran small","I've only ordered once and it's a bikini. It came fairly quickly and the item is great quality. My only issue is the bottoms I ordered in a US 4, came in as an XS. Size 4 is definitely not an XS. So the bottom don't fit exactly like they should because of that. Overall the product is really nice."
"April 12, 2017",3,Recommended even though few bad experinces,"I have ordered a lot from ASOS. I only had two bad experiences.I usually get my packages quite quick, so when I hadn't got it after 10 days I wrote to ASOS. They said sorry and send me a new package right away - my first package showed up the next day, so it was probably just the post office being very slow!I once recieved the wrong pair of socks and I was told the right pair was sold out, but I could get a refund without sending the socks back. So I opened the socks (of course, because I didn't have to send them back), but then the next day I was told I had to send them back, which wouldn't be possible once they were opened! I would still recommend ASOS though"

"April 10, 2017",5,I love ASOS,I love ASOS. If I receive a product I don't like the returns are super easy and include a shipping label. I just put right in my mailbox and they keep me updated each step of the way. Also they ship fast. The variety of clothes is also amazing!
"April 09, 2017",5,I love Asos!,I love Asos!I use the site all the time. The site is easy to navigate through and there is sooo much to choose from. The prices are good and the quality is often better than expected. I will definitely keep shopping!
"April 09, 2017",1,I honestly don't know why ASOS has gone …,"I honestly don't know why ASOS has gone so bad these past few months. I have had issues with my deliveries, my returns and their customer service is beyond awful. I have to constantly chase my items and them each time a different staff member responds generically which means I am repeating myself each time whilst getting no where. I had an item sent which was so tacky so it needed returning however the label was faulty so last week I emailed asking for another label, I am still waiting for a reply. Appalling."
"April 08, 2017",4,I wish to give 5 stars based on the …,"I wish to give 5 stars based on the following:- ease of ordering- great website with great interfacing- excellent order followup communications via email- tracking automatically provided through email- fast shipping- easy returns; no hassle and FREE- great price for my item, Bardot Jumpsuit!- fantastic style and fit!- timely deliveryI am giving a 4 star rating, instead, for the following reason:- fabric was v-e-r-y thin.  I planned this for a night (dark) outing so I was   able to make it work.  Had to bc I relied on this item for my trip and   could not go out and shop for a replacement with little time.  My aerioli   were visible through the thin black fabric.  Thankfully, the bardot flap   covered this, but the thin-ness all over compromised my confidence for   this event."
"April 07, 2017",1,Worst Customer Service Ever,"To be honest if I could give a rating lower than 1 star I would.Having lost my order - which was for my daughters Birthday , the courier company DPD insisted I speak to ASOS so that they could have enough information to start a lost parcel search . They gave me a number to call ASOS- which I did. The parcel failed to arrive in time for the Birthday and I then received a mobile phone bill of £18.32 for the phone call to ASOS- clearly on a ridiculously inflated premium line -  which they refuse to refund .I also wasted a morning of my valuable time. When I raised the issue via their on line ""service ""- misnomer if ever there was one - I was told they ""don't speak to customers "" so basically tough !Their on line customer service is nothing more than a blocking mechanism stopping them ever having to acknowledge poor service or customer problemsI would seriously encourage anyone considering using this company to avoid like the plague"
"April 07, 2017",3,Bad company,"Bad company, slow communications from my experience."
"April 07, 2017",1,Very very bad customer service,"Very bad customer service. In the UK they do not have a phone line but only a chat function, well ok its 2017. But here comes the problem: The UK customer service cannot help me because I live in the Netherlands. The Dutch customer service has no phone line ánd no chat function, only email. Average reply time of their 4 emails: 23,5 hours. Would accept this all if they would help me but they did not. The package was not delivered by DHL (even the DHL customer service told me they could see on GPS that the deliverer has not been to my door) and then the package was returned to Asos. Asos cannot trace individual packages and they say I have to order again. Half of my items are not in sale anymore or are sold out. My package is still not at their depot but they are unwilling to pick it out and return it. This is very very very easy to do, I myself work with traceability systems so I know what I am talking about. They are holding my money for 4 weeks before refunding it so even if I could re-order the items that are sold out, and even if I was willing to pay full price for the items that are not in sale anymore, this is not something very easy to do for most people."
"April 06, 2017",1,Asos sounds like ..,"Truly, truly terrible .. Not even worth taking the time to explain. AVOID.I suspect any review that is above 1 is fake."

"April 05, 2017",5,Don't believe all the cynical one star reviews,"I've used ASOS for well over 4 years now, probably order clothes once a month from here, never encountered a single problem, my items arrive in time and the quality and prices of the products are amazing, would highly recommend."
"April 05, 2017",4,Very good and efficient service,Very good and efficient service. The items I ordered are exactly as on the website and the delivery was fast (especially considering that I do not live in the UK!). Only complaint is that they delivered one item in the wrong color - but otherwise a very satisfactory experience :) I will definitely be back again! Thank you!
"April 04, 2017",5,Love asos.,Love asos.  Speedy delivery and good quality clothes
"April 04, 2017",1,Don't order unless you need more stress in life,"I placed an order, on the day it was due to be delivered, I tracked it and found out it was damaged and being returned to Asos. I then contacted Asos to ask them to send me replacement products, they said if I wanted replacements I had to order and pay again but they wouldn't refund me until they received their parcel back which could take 7 working days to get back to them then up to 5 working days for a refund. I explained that the items were a gift and could not afford to reorder without my refund. They said they had a process to follow - at no point did they make any suggestion to try and rectify the situation. They said as soon as they had my parcel they would issue my refund. This morning I received an email saying they had my parcel - but gave only refunded one product! I went on site and used their 'ask me a question', the reply I got was that if I don't hear the other items have been refunded to sent them my tracking number. I tried to send them another message asking them to read the notes on my order as I hadn't even seen the parcel I wouldn't have a tracking number. Their website kept crashing when trying to send. I messaged them on Facebook to ask them to let me know when they were refunding the money they owe me as I wanted an end to this stressful situation - at this point I am missing a gift, my money and the time I have wasted going round in circles with their customer services. I have never experienced such awful service from any company and feel like I am being made to chase my own money. I will never use them again."
"April 04, 2017",2,Disappointed,"This is my first time ordering off ASOS.I received a text saying that ASOS would attempt to deliver my parcel yesterday between 1&5. This did I not happen it arrived a day late.I also received an email saying my item had been delivered when there was no parcel for me to open. False information.I ordered grey jeans size W28 L32, the receipt said W28 L32 the sticker on the plastic the jeans where wrapped in said W28 L32 but they were W30 L32. This is not the correct size.Call me picky but although the rest of the parcel was fine and had no troubles I needed those jeans for something of importance and not only were they late, they were the wrong size. Cheers ASOS I suggest you get that sorted xo"
"April 04, 2017",1,Parcel company lied / ASOS don't care,Parcel company lied and said they had attempted to deliver. Waited in all day. ASOS customer service- 'sorry about that' and I can reorder. Items now out of stock. Company is too big for them to manage customer service effectively. I have been a customer regularly since 2003 and will be ceasing to shop with them after the response from CS. May as well have said 'ahh tough luck'
"April 04, 2017",1,Poor,"Poor, poor, poor customer service.. I had paid for next working day delivery.. 3 days later still waiting for the parcel. They had my parcel on hold at DPD, ASOS failed to action any think there end. Will never use ASOS again... Update ** order arrived 6 days late."
"April 04, 2017",1,The worst experience I've had with jeans,"Abysmal. Originally gave a five star review but received a faulty pair of the same jeans TWICE. This includes rips and tears on both, the buttons being rusted on the second pair, the second pair smelling of pot noodle.ASOS refused to accept that there was a problem and basically said I was lying, despite sending photos of said jeans. I apparently have to send them back a SECOND TIME in order to get my money back. Absolutely ridiculous will not buy again.They even had the cheek to offer me 10% off my next order, the jeans went down £2 after I bought them which takes the p*** and my student card gets me the same if not more of a discount and that's unlimited!"
"April 03, 2017",5,Never dissappointed with the service …,"Never dissappointed with the service here, prompt and easy."
"April 03, 2017",1,I have received the wrong item on four …,"I have received the wrong item on four different occasions over the past 2 years. Two of these were after I complained that I received the wrong item, and they just sent me the same horrible dress again. They don't actually read or listen to what you are telling them. Just try and ""resolve"" the problem quickly to get rid of you. Customer service is absolute rubbish. They offer you no compensation for repeatedly messing up. Now I have the hassle of returning 3 items I didn't even want due to their own mess up. You shouldn't have to work to be a paying customer. I have received a much better service from other online clothes retailers. ASOS don't deserve the business and I will be cancelling my account with them."
"April 03, 2017",1,I used to shop a lot on asos and since …,"I used to shop a lot on asos and since moving to switzerland I have not had a single order arrive in the estimated time, i've had numerous orders just not arrive and when I raise this with customer services the items are then out of stock and was just told i was being refunded months after ordering and emailing. No remorse is ever shown as if the service team are fed up dealing with so many complaints, I've also had some agents just end a conversation before I have finished speaking. To them, it is just another bad transaction. Too much time to be wasted in a shop that is not competent in their logistics and still attempts to ship to 100s of customers every day, not a happy customer at all."
"April 01, 2017",2,Don't count on actually receiving your order/super horrible customer service,"Super horrible customer service, don't count on your items arriving! I love asos clothing/brands so much that I keep gambling and ordering items, but I am ALWAYS disappointed. My items either show up months after their estimated delivery date, or do not show up. Was charged for clothes that I never received. When I asked them to look into the issue, they told me my clothes were out of stock and they weren't coming to me. They refunded me my money at least (3 months later), but had I not looked into the issue, they would not have. They do not care about international customers either, I can never track my shipping, so I never know if my items are coming or not. If they had a store in Canada, I would shop there every single day. But I probably will not order from them online again, considering my most recent experiences."
"March 31, 2017",5,Love it,"I love Asos!The clothing is lovely and includes all kinds of brands and price ranges. (The own brand stuff is great quality). If you pay 10 pounds you get next day delivery for a year, which is always on time andI never had any problems with it whatsoever (I order to my office). The return is quick and easy, it has never taken longer then 5 days for my money to be refunded.I also think the app is brilliant and makes it easy to browse and save items you like. I have ordered from Asos many, many times and never had the slightest problem at all."
"March 31, 2017",3,Ordered from Germany many times,"Ordered from Germany many times, some times it went wrong but I love the clothes!"
"March 31, 2017",1,One the worst customer services there …,"One the worst customer services there is. I got two completely different answers regarding a parcel that has been delivered to the wrong pick up address. First I was told that they could give the delivery company a new order ""no problem!"" so to speak. After a few days and still no delivery at correct address, I contacted them again. This time I was told that they could not help me due to security reasons. The most annoying thing is they kept referring to the chat I had with customer service the first time and trying to convince me that I had been advised differently than what I actually was. I.e. customer service made up advice that I had not been given. They are a joke. No more Asos for me."
"March 31, 2017",1,the worst service !!!!,"I was ordering all the time everything at ASOS.COM.. but now i will not order anything... Let's discuss my story:I have ordered bag pack at asos and payed 27 dollars for this.. after 2 weeks i'm receiving i don't know exactly what it is... it is not scarf and also it is not hair accessorize but it is something like that. i have contacted with the customer service of asos and they told me that i have to return this item back, there is another problem i have to pay 30 $ to return back this item and you know that i have payed 27 for bag... it is funny that the cost of the bag for me will be 57 dollars.. also i have ordered Adidas gazelle 1 month ago and of course i have received wrong size.. i don't know what to do they are not helping me to solve this problem !!!! I'm shocked !"
"March 30, 2017",1,worst customer service EVER,Their product is okay but their customer service is a joke everybody is rude unpleasant stupid and not helpful. Security details are freaking hilarious and even blocks customers from getting help. Get ready to wait a week before you hear anyting back from them. They dont even have a phone line for customer service. What a joke. Overall not worth it. Products are just okay so buy from other stores with good customer service and an actual service center with a phone number
"March 29, 2017",1,Asos express delivery,"Asos express delivery-I've used asos on multiple occasions and never having a problem up to this. However, on this occasion I had £82 worth of items in my basket, I then got a promotion offer saying spend an extra £18 and receive express delivery for no extra cost. I proceeded to find an item I wanted to get this promotion after doing this I went to the checkout and paid. The date of payment was 27/03 at 6pm so I was expecting the items on the following day or at the latest the 29/03. On the 29/03 I didn't receive my items so I was a bit worried. I went online and spoke to asos customer service advisor he then told me my item was sent standard delivery, which straight away made me ask him why when I bought the extra items just to qualify for express delivery.  His answer was ""if you changed your method of payment it may have reset the delivery option"" how can they justify this being the reason why? Even if this did actually happen, why would anyone want standard Delivery when they've qualified for express next day delivery? Personally I think the way the customer service advisor spoke to me was inappropriate. He wasn't apologetic he was blaming it all on me."
"March 29, 2017",5,No problems,"I have used Asos regularly for a long time. I have always found the transactions smooth, deliveries quick and customer service to be excellent. Returns never a problem, quick to refund."
"March 28, 2017",4,A trustworthy place to shop,"I have purchased from asos now for around 5 times, my friends also purchase from Asos and the delivery is always on time, even before to when the delivery was expected. The things are exactly as in the picture, and the actual Asos brand stuff is very good, I ordered some Asos brand shoes and they are beautiful, comfy and just perfect.All 5 times ive purchased i have never had a negative or troublesome experience, even when I put the wrong email that I did not use anymore to my order, they changed it for me.so Yes, do buy from asos, I recommend it and theyre very trustworthy.If you have a problem, live chat is available so theres always someone that can immediately help you :)"
"March 28, 2017",4,Excellent site,"Excellent site and app , good choice have used them for the last two years and pay for the premium delivery (£9.99 a year I think )  which I have not had and issue with 99% of my order have been delivered with DPD who text in the morning to advise of an hour delivery slot , you can change the delivery date and track the parcel throughout the day and even have the option to let the driver no where to leave the parcel in adage location if you are not in , would have rated five stars but had an issue with a discount code and cust service were not really helpful"
"March 28, 2017",1,The Worst!,"Frustrated having watched my wife navigate what has turned into a reficulous ordeal. Owning a business where customer service counts, and after now reading COUNTLESS reviews stating similar frustrated customer experiences, I don't understand how they are still in business.  Hopefully these reviews catch your eye before spending your money with ASOS.  Word to the wise, DON'T!!!  They are BRUTAL!"
"March 27, 2017",5,Best Fashion/Clothing Website,"I have shopped online using ASOS for years, they have more stock than ever before, bringing more and more brands on all of the time.  i pay for the annual next day delivery which is amazing.  Although DPD (which they use) has let me down once, I cannot fault the site for their great customer service.  This is my go-to website when I need to grab a present or want some more clothing or make up. It's a shame not all of their happy customers write a review on here to tell everyone how great ASOS is, this would certainly out-weigh the amount of complaints below.  ASOS IS AWESOME!"
"March 27, 2017",1,Account get blocked for no reason,"Ordered 2 times form them, first time it was ok, but my account got blocked right away....Second time i needed a gift for a friend, after 1 days they send me an email. They have a problem with may american express card (really problmes with amex?) and i have to send them id and a copy of my bank blanace ??? NO way i will ever order again from this idiots..."
"March 27, 2017",5,Amazing customer service everytime,"I regularly order from ASOS. I have always received their items within just a few days of ordering them. Whenever I have had to return anything, they have received it very quickly and processed it within 1 or 2 days of receiving it. Whenever I have contacted customer service they have been both quick and friendly in their responses! Best online shopping service."
"March 27, 2017",5,People Are Dying Kim™,"I've been shopping at ASOS for almost 7 years now. I've always gone in with level headed expectations and ASOS has always gone above and beyond. I've ordered from every category at many different times of the year, with several different discounts and coupon codes used. Clothes are great quality and they have a wonderfully diverse range. Customer service is incredible and the returns and exchange program is extremely useful. They recently accidently did not refund me one dress short after i returned some things i didn't like, i had a answer and refund within 1.5hrs. Shipping over the years has always been above board for UK to Australia shipping, and this comes from someone who often shops online and always shops from overseas online vendors. Shipping is a finicky thing that is often out of retailers hands and expecting ASOS to perform miracles is completely ludicrous. If you can't handle the online shopping experience without a tantrum contained within rediculous reviews, don't buy online."
"March 24, 2017",5,Easy returns and good quality clothing,"I've ordered from Asos for about 4 years now and have had zero issues. Packages arrive timely, returns are so easy because you don't have to pay for postage or go drop off at another location, and they have so much variety in styles and prices."
"March 24, 2017",1,False marketing pretences And bad customer service,Today i found asos And was interested in trying the webshop because of a 20% shopping spree. After spending over an hour creating my wishlist i checken out At 11:45. I entered the code And it worked. But i forgot something So i went back Added it and tried again. At this time THE code stoped working. It was about 11:50. So i contacted customer support. After a 45 min chat they told me there is nothing that they could do because THE discount ended At 12:00. I told them i was checking out before that And also that At 00:18 they were still advertising with the messages. But still no service what So ever. I was willing To buy 8 products. But i left THE shop with nothing And over 2 Hours of my time wasted. I have screenshots of THE times advertised. Horrible service.

"March 23, 2017",1,Lacking customer service,"I have placed many orders with ASOS in the past without trouble. My recent order has not areived and after several emails to customer service instead of giving me an answer to where my package is they have asked me 4 times to give them 48hrs to try an sort it out! It's been 2 weeks and they are still asking me to wait 48hrs!!! It's the worst customer service I have had to deal with. The will not give me a refund or resend my package. Their only solution is for me to wait until they get back to me after 48hrs, they never do so I end up sending an email and then they tell me to wait 48hrs again. They have done this 4 times!!! Terrible service"
"March 23, 2017",2,Next Day Delivery service is too risky for people with jobs!,"ASOS charges extra for next day delivery, or encourages joining the Premier scheme to get it. However it is a risky service that can deliver anytime from 7am - 11pm. You choose next day because you need something urgently. But unless you are at the same address all day and all evening you may miss your urgent delivery. Work address is no good, home address is no good if you have a job you have to be at!For a premium delivery service why is the time range so ludicrous and risky for customers? This is poor service."
"March 22, 2017",2,terrible helpline,the help line was rude yet the site is great
"March 21, 2017",1,Customer Services Useless,I have contacted Customer service on two occasions now. Both times they have been staggeringly useless. Both times I have drawn out email conversations because I find myself repeating everything that has been said in the previously correspondence when a new handler responds. It seems as if all they are their to do is to provide a tick box response and unable to scroll down the email chain to actually understand the problem.
"March 21, 2017",1,Avoid like Dog Poo,"Absolute rubbish. The worst thing was both times it was a gift from family. One time the item didn't fit so asked for a refund wouldn't allow me because it was shipped to Australia (it shouldn't matter) and I wasn't the person who ordered. Second time I got a voucher but it was sent in my trash and got deleted after a few weeks, asked them to re-send but it was a major hassle.Stay away"
"March 21, 2017",3,"Overall not bad, but can be improved","(+) Can find a decent selection of clothes and a bargain now and then(+) No fuss returns (by post or drop off)(+) Delivery is usually pretty swift(+) Discount codes can be found(+) 24 hour help chat and generally they are quite courteous (but far less helpful than before)(-) Exchange rates are an abomination, we are talking like 50% difference to market rates in some cases, so if you are shopping from abroad, you might get caught out here. Despite the fact, that as of now (2017), the GBP exchange rates are notably low, you will find the rates used by the site are like when the economy was thriving(-) The way they handle some issues are really inefficient. For example, I recently placed an order but the discount code didn't get applied for some reason and I overlooked it. I messaged them around a couple of hours later to see if they can apply it retrospectively, but they said they cannot do anything, I must return the package to them once received then order again. I live abroad so it seems a complete farce to have to do this, overall, I end up waiting much longer and they lose out on having to cover the delivery charges(-) Some things are actually really expensive, but disguised as bargains(-) Sizing can be quite misleading, but I guess you can return it free of charge so it's not so bad"
"March 19, 2017",1,Horrific Customer Service,"I placed on order with this company on 3/2/17. At the time the had a discount with unidays offering 20% off instead of the usual 10%. I place my order and the discount somehow did not calculate properly so I contact their customer service immediately through chat. I was told it wasn't a problem and I would be refunded 16.90. I was fine with that. About an hour goes by I get an email stating the refund was processed and I would see it in 5-10 days. Time goes by about a week I contact customer service again stating I have yet to receive the refund I am then told oh we don't offer refunds you received the correct discount. I then showed proof of the original conversation and the email stating I was entitled to 16.90. And this was done after dealing with several reps because every time I would respond a different rep seemed to get my emails that alone made me angry. So one of the reps tells me my refund was sent to my credit card manually. So a red flag goes up I paid with PayPal how can you bypass PayPal and refund it to my card I did not have one on file with them! I asked the rep that very question and was told it can be done and to wait the full 10 days. So on 3/15/17 I contacted customer service again because I still have no refund and once again I have to deal with several reps before getting a concrete answer. I am then told by one of the rudest reps there it hasn't been 10 days only 9. Now I know I can count and I insist it has been sinnce this started in 3/1. He in turn says they are counting from 3/2 and the 10th day is 3/16. He also requested I send my bank statement me for that time period to show I did not get the refund which I thought was odd but I complied. Once I sent proof I was then emailed again oh you have to wait til after 3/16 and if it still isn't there to  contact customer service again. At this point I'm angey all this over 16.90 but I was determined to follow this through it has now become about the principle. I then open a transaction error cause with PayPal explaining what's going on just seeking further assistance in this matter. So I go ahead and wait til 3/17/17 and contact asos customer service again. Before doing so I attempted to log into my account and I get an error message you account has been blocked of course I am now confused. Why would I account be blocked??? I contact customer service through chat and the rep tells me I see it's blocked but I have to have another rep contact you. I asked well can you at least tell my why the account it blocked? The rep says no. I then contact customer service through email on the same email thread I had been using asking about the refund and the account block. I get and email back stating they are looking into it and that I dont need to send anymore emails. So fast forward to today 3/19/17. I get an email saying the account was closed because I opened the case with PayPal stating fraud and PayPal determined it was fraud and the company took a financial loss because of this . Any orders I place in the future will be canceled with no notice. Now I'm livid I check PayPal and the have not determined fraud and have not made a final decision. I was not given a refund for the 16.90 and instead of asos figuring out what was going on they just decided to block me from future purchase. I have never been so disgusted with a company in my life. All this over 16.90. So recap I still don't have the refund, my asos account is blocked and I am no long allowed to make purchases. Horrific, terrible and most unprofessional company every I would recommend no one ever shop with them again if they can be this petty over 16.90 imagine what they would do over a higher dollar amount.Update 3/21/17 So my refund saga continues since my last post I was contacted and told they would do an investigation. That was 3/17/17. So today I finally get another email saying they sent a refund to a card that is not active anymore I don't even know what card it is. The problem here is I paid through PayPal with an active card. So they decided to not use the original payment method and just choose a card they saw on my account. No one contacted me to verify this was ok or which card to use. This right here just shows how terrible their customer service is. And then on top of that told me my account will not be reopened until I close the case with PayPal. Are they serious???? So to sum up I still don't have the refund, I don't know what card they sent it to and my account is still not opened. I warn everyone beware of shopping with this company!"
"March 19, 2017",1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY,This company is a fraud. They falsely advertise delivery dates to get you to make a purchase. Then it takes 3 weeks to get your items if at all. I ordered two items for an all white event I'm attending. I placed the order because the website said it would arrive on or before 3/14 which is two weeks before my event. The item never arrived and is now actually lost or stolen by the mail carrier. I've asked for a refund or a new shipment sent express so I can have it before I leave. All I get is generic emails with no answers as to when I will receive a new shipment or refund. A computer is generating their responses because none of my questions are being answered. There is no customer service within this company. No phone number to speak with anyone. If you have a problem you are on your own. They have insurance on all their packages yet they procrastinate about giving you a refund or sending a new order. Don't buy from this company and save yourself the stress and aggravation.
"March 18, 2017",5,"Great Shop, Customer Service Little weak","i use this place to shop all the time, great products delivery times and prices, customer services on the rare occasion i contact them do take a long time to reply...3 days.Overall Highly recommend."
"March 18, 2017",5,my best provider :),"hello, i have been using asos for six years now. i am from Romania and, at the time I started to order on asos, not many companies made online deliveries here. i never had an issue with the products or with the sizes. the prices are fair and the quality is sometimes amazing for the price you pay. they have delivered all the orders in time and they have refunded money instantly in case of any small issue. what's helping me most is their catwalk and their accurate description of the product. keep up the good work :)"
"March 18, 2017",1,"Ordered a pair of shoes, gave me a dress instead.","I didn't order anything fancy - in fact just a pair of trainers. Nothing else. Since it was a sale item it was immediately sold out. I was told mixed information some claiming they could replace it/ while others said it was sold out. In the end, my shoes were sold out and I had to go out of my way. Print out a new label and send back the wrong item they gave me. Had I known earlier I would've placed my order elsewhere. Since I've never had issues with ASOS up until this point. After much complaint one of the staff offered me a 10 per cent discount on all their full priced item. (Which is an insult in my personal opinion). And I kindly reminded them I already have that discount since I'm a full time university student. Overall, a complete waste of my time and personal resources to send it back to them. Now I have to wait over a month for my refund to come."
"March 17, 2017",1,Poor Customer Service,"First off, the fact that they do not have a telephone number to reach customer service directly, is an automatic no-no! Secondly, it takes them forever to process returns, and issue refunds. It took them over a month to refund me 245.00. Thirdly, I wouldnt need to return any of their product in the first place, had they got my order correct. I ordered a pair of Chelsea Boots size 12. They sent me a size 10 right shoe and a size 11 right shoe!!!! They sent me a pair of pants that was damaged and too small. When I confronted them about it (via online chat) there was no remorse, they just simply asked ""did you return it yet?""  They have THE worst customer service, and honestly their product only fits a certain type of guy. I am an African-American male from the south and I realized that their product is not made to fit me. LOL. All in all, they have POOR customer service skills, and as of today I AM STILL WAITING ON MY REFUND!  ... What a bloody shame!"
"March 17, 2017",5,Great!,"Website is very easy to use. Stock is always updated.Quality clothes.Returns are free.Refunds are always prompt. Delivery is fast and even deliver on Sunday! Loads of brands, all at competitive prices.One of the best clothing online stores.Genuine company."
"March 16, 2017",1,Pure costumer care,"I have had some issue placing an order because there has been some issue regarding my account. I have been in contact with almost every employee  of Asos costumer care for the last 2 weeks and the they keep saying that they can't not see there is a problem regarding my account so they do not understand why I have issue placing an order. Asos Costumer care has now send me some guides to how to delete cookies, history and other technical things i should do before placing a new order. And I have now tried to do everything they have asked me to do and nothing helps. I've now lost my patience with this company and does not recommend any one to buy from them....!"
"March 16, 2017",3,Average quality,Arrived ok but average quality
"March 16, 2017",1,If only I could rate no stars....,What an appalling company. Item ordered and wrong one received so returned for replacement which again wrong item received and substituted for a cheaper item in completely wrong style and colour.  Then told item not in stock.  Customer service a complete waste of time - so unhelpful and do not seem to know their stock.  Offered a ten percent discount on next order  and  only after asking but waste of time as already have an SU card and would not risk a third time. After reading other reviews would appear this isn't an isolated problem. Account being closed as just not worth the hassle
"March 16, 2017",5,A happy customer,"All I can say is that I am TRULY impressed by how easy it was to order, cancel, return and exchange my item. In the end i got exactly what I wanted. Fabulous service!! ASOS is definitely my new favourite place to shop!❤"
"March 16, 2017",1,Awful customer service,"I pay for a premier account, which includes next day delivery. I ordered 2 items which were due to be delivered the next day. 2 days later I still hadn't received my items (1 of which was a gift I needed to post to a friend), I looked on their website and couldn't see a phone number - I needed an immediate response so I dug around on the internet until I found one and called to speak to their customer service team.The person I spoke to was rude and abrupt, disconnected my call after 15 minutes telling me there had been a problem with the order, one of the items was now unavailable (the one that was a gift) and the other would be reordered and dispatched the next day. I called back saying that was not good enough, and after a further 45 minutes on the phone was told they could offer me 15% discount on my next order. Since they'd already left it too late for me to order another present for my friend, and I already get 10% discount as a student, I said I felt this wasn't good enough - I had paid for a service I had not received. Eventually, however, I got so frustrated with their awful customer service I decided to leave it and just steer away from using them in the future, once my premier account had ended. Fast forward a month and my phone bill arrives in the mail, I find that I have been charged £25 for the privilege of this hour on the phone. I contacted their customer service team once again and was told that as they don't advertise their number on their website, they were under no obligation to do anything about this (despite not providing clear pricing information for a premium rate number as per their legal obligation). I will NEVER be using this company again and I strongly encourage you to do the same. Their customer service is awful unless you complain through public channels. No interest in helping customers, only maintaining a public image on their twitter/facebook pages."
"March 16, 2017",5,EXCELLENT ALL ROUND,"I have shopped with ASOS for a good few years now. All I can say is that I am really impressed! They have sales all year round, and the shipping is very fast. I have found it difficult in the past to shop for clothes online, but ASOS has made it easy with their wide product range and quality of the clothes.  I simply love this company and now I do not shop anywhere else for clothes. I have been recommending ASOS to my family and friends."
"March 15, 2017",1,Never experienced such a bad service in my life before.,"I've placed an order and was promised a delivery 5 days later at latest. This was a present for my best friends wedding. The delivery originally got refused at the click and collect store. This happened twice and when I rang up to say I need the delivery on the day they've told me I'll receive it. I was told it's not possible, which means now I'm boarding a flight tonight without the special presents for my friend. This is really disappointing and will never buy anything on Asos again or use click and collect service as nobody wanted to help in taking the extra mile to get the delivery out to me on the day promised. Awful customer service. Please do not waste your time."
"March 15, 2017",5,Love ASOS!,One of my fave online shops! Always efficient & always provide excellent customer service! Thank you for being awesome ASOS! ☺👍🏽💕
"March 15, 2017",4,Good service,"Bought many stuffs on this website and never had any problem in delivery, size whatsoever. Recommend!"
"March 15, 2017",3,High priced,Ordered two jeans and they arrived late. Again the price seemed to be a little higher when compared to the local store. I am not going to buy anything again. But the quality was good.
"March 15, 2017",1,Never again,"Honestly so disgusted and disappointed in this company. For anyone looking to spend on this company please take my advice and SAVE YOUR MONEY. I've ordered from Asos now twice and BOTH times my items have been ""delayed"" and I've received within 30+days from the day I bought it. Ridiculous. Normally I wouldn't even mind getting it at a delayed date, but when I originally made my recent purchase I noticed on the date of delivery that they stated ""no later than"", which like everyone else I assumed I was safe receiving it before my event especially how they emphasized the ""no later than..."". As I was expecting my package on the date, it never arrived. As an extremely frustrated customer that now has no outfit to wear on a very important day, I took to their live chat, and all their customer representative offered me was an insincere apology, and told me that they were able to do nothing about it(BOTH TIMES). I then asked them to send me some sort of proof that my package was sent on that day and they claimed they were unable to do that for me. As a customer and having this now twice happen to me, makes me wonder if this company even ships their packages on the date they say they do, because again I find this extremely ironic having the same exact thing now happen to me twice. The reason I'm so frustrated is because of how established this company claims they are, yet their delivery takes months. I've ordered from @missguided and @boohooofficial before and to my understanding when they send internationally (free at cost), they actually send the package no later than a week. After my last experience I know to never spend a penny on @asos , and will make sure to advise others not to as well!"
"March 14, 2017",5,Great service as usual,"Picked up some bargains in the sale and arrived the next day, great service as always"
"March 14, 2017",1,Waited over 2 months for refund,"I've returned some christmas gifts to you the 28th of december and Asos received the items the 5th of january. My girlfriend bought the items and paid through Paypal and they told her to update her Asos account with her credit card number, because they cannot make a refund through Paypal. Fair enough... this update was made the same day. Every time she tries to mail Asos, so that they know that the account is updated, they keep telling her to update her account. THIS IS ALREADY DONE! Now, over 2 months since they received the items, i still haven't got my refund!It's great with free shipping and returns in Denmark, but it's my last time shopping at Asos."
"March 14, 2017",5,100% Recommend,"Idk why there are so many bad reviews about asos, but I've always had a great experience with them. It always tells you roughly what date it will arrive, great customer service, heaps of deals/sales etc."
"March 14, 2017",5,It's been a journey,"Back in the day when the internet shopping was new, I came across a site callled as seen on screen it was pretty basic with something like 3 categories but the chance to have something that wasn't in every high street store appealed to me. So I placed me first order about 17 years ago and I use them so much that I have the Asos premier and A list member I couldn't even count how many orders I have placed in a year let alone in the 17 years i have shopped with them and even if there was any problems they dealt with it perfectly.I would always recommend Asos and I will continue to use them for years to come"
"March 14, 2017",1,Total Chaos,"If I could give them zero stars I would. I ordered a bikini set from asos and received two bikini tops. When I tried to correct the order, I found they have no US customer service phone number, so I had to DM them on twitter. They then told me that they could not replace the wrong top for a bottom because it was then out of stock. They basically told me sorry I was out of luck and to just return my items, so I did. I was then only refunded for the incorrect item and not the other item I retuned. I returned two items and was refunded for one. So currently I am out 30 dollars and 3 weeks with no bikini to show for it. Never order anything from this store, because anything that can go wrong will go wrong. Their company is just total chaos, and I don't know how they've held it together so far."
"March 11, 2017",5,Thank you Asos,"I ordered my bridesmaid dresses from ASOS's TFNC Wedding range (which i highly recommend as they are great value for money).It turned out i had ordered the incorrect size for one of my bridesmaids and had ordered the items over 2 months ago.We decided we would like to order a slightly different style of dress from the same range to better suit the bridesmaid but due to exceeding ASOS's return policy, though this may have meant me being out of pocket. I was able to chat to an ASOS customer service rep about my issue via Facebook messenger on a Sunday evening where I was promply responded to, they advised to return the dress and if the warehouse is happy with the condition they may be able to refund me the money. If not they will just send the dress back to me. In the meantime i ordered the different style dress and returned the other.ASOS refunded me for the dress on return, even though going by their terms they didnt have to. For someone planning a wedding this was amazing!Highly recommend!"
"March 11, 2017",1,Don't buy from them!,"The entire experience was horrendous.  My order was 8 days late to start with.  When I got it, the suit jacket and pants were from different die lots so they did not match.  We didn't notice it until I had it on out in the light.  I asked them to send me a pair that matched and they refused because I had put the pants on and taken the tag off.The customer service person was rude and offered no solutions."
"March 11, 2017",4,Lots of choice,I have used Asos many times as there is such a great selection with prices to suit all budgets. Delivery with DPD is always superb however there have been a number of issues when the delivery service is through hermes. I have had parcels left in my front garden and cards through my door when I have been sat waiting in the house. I have even caught him in the act of leaving a card without knocking first!
"March 11, 2017",1,Ok if you would prefer dog food,"I ordered four pairs of shoes for an up and coming wedding for next day delivery.. I received a box ( very large and extremely heavy) of dog food!!.. spent an entire week of comunication with ASOS and a total of 6 different poeple only to be told today - a week later that they have cancelled my order as mine went to someone else... so I have wasted a week of my time with no alternative and been left with a box of dog food.. I don't own a dog!!. And no shoes for the wedding... total shambles of a company, impossible to speak to the same persons more than once so you have to explain your story to everyone..I asked to speak to senior management and was ignored. I haven't been offered any form of compensation for my appalling experience and certainly would not recommend them to anyone."
"March 10, 2017",5,As always - get exactly what I pay for,"Used asos over 50 times and have never been disappointed - flawless service and good customer support, easy to buy and return."
"March 10, 2017",4,Slow but good service,Bought clothes from Asos several times and I'm happy with my purchases. Had a problem with a delivery twice but they solved the problem. Just took too long.
"March 09, 2017",4,Great selection of clothes - some couriers let them down though,"I've been ordering from ASOS for years - they have a briliant selection of clothes and footwear for me and my wife, and we always sign up to ASOS Premier as it's such good value. I would have given them 5 stars but unfortunately the one main aspect that lets them down is deliveries. As I get unlimited next day delivery, it's always great to be able to order something last minute and get it the next day. When my orders have been delivered with DPD I have never had a single issue! But when I've had things delivered by anyone else (usually Hermes)  they've generally been terrible - late/part deliveries, things thrown over the fence into my back garden, no idea where your parcel is etc.. Unfortunately it's a bit of a lottery as to which courier service they will use to despatch your items. I did try contacting ASOS and asking them to put a note on my account to only send out with DPD but I still get orders from Hermes on occasion. So for ASOS it's 5 stars definitely but unfortunately their delivery service is still letting them down."
"March 09, 2017",5,great variety and never had any problem,"I am customer for yea. i love their products and variety and i neve rhad any issue with delivery, return or refund. always smooth,"
"March 09, 2017",2,Poor customer service!!,"Very disappointed, requested my parcel be delivered to store on a specific date, parcel never arrived, contacted to re-arrange delivery and they said they had to deliver to a different store and not for 2 more days, when the day arrived I had to phone ASOS for an update on the whereabouts of my parcel, they informed me that it had been returned to them. They refused to sent it back out to my address. The are going to take atleast 7 days to process it as a return and even longer to return my £400. Fuming to say the least. Items I wanted to buy are immediately out of stock! Shop somewhere else!"
"March 08, 2017",2,Sizes,"When shopping from literally any other site I order t shirts in size Large, from asos I have to order XXL and even then they're a tight fit. Slightly confusing."
"March 08, 2017",1,Too big for a personal service,I think they're too big because when inhalen a question about return goods the reactions are very slowly!
"March 07, 2017",1,The stuff isn't worth the horrible customer service,"Reported that my order was showing as delivered & signed for by me even though it hasn't been. Live chat agent repeated what the tracking said and then refused to do anything about it - and then closed the chat! When I complained about it to their Facebook team, the /exact/ same thing happened. Seriously, don't even bother shopping with these guys. I've never experienced worse customer 'service'."
"March 07, 2017",5,Excellent service,As a new and first time customer I ordered a jacket. The jacket arrived within the promised timeframe. However I choose to return the jacket as it didn't fit properly. I used the free of charge return service and within a few days I've got an email saying the jacket was returned and a few days later the amount paid was returned to my account. Great service!
"March 06, 2017",1,A trivial matter and they refused,"Order wasn't dispatched and noticed the item was in the sale. Asked them if they would cancel this for me, and then I could purchase the discounted item. Or to the simpler option for my convenience; refund the difference. I have been a long standing customer, but last year I don't think I ordered anything from them. This was my first ""splash"" of the year, I was looking forward to spending a lot more, for holidays coming up hopefully. It wasn't entirely about the money, it was that their solution was to inconvenience me so that I give in and don't bother. Well you've won 👎🏾"
"March 06, 2017",1,Bad customer service,"They take forever to credit your account.  Every time you chat with someone from customer service they give you a date when your bank account will be credited, but it doesn't happen, then when you contact them again, they want you to send them your banking statement.  What reputable company does that?  They outright steal your money"
"March 06, 2017",1,Poor sizing.,"I ordered a jacket, on their site they said the model wearing it was 6ft 3 and was wearing a medium sized jacket, i'm a slim build and i'm 5ft 10, i opted to order the large size, well that large size might be large to a pygmy! £125 that jacket cost, i won't be ordering from these again, their delivery is slow too, 1st time i've used them, and last."
"March 04, 2017",1,Inept and almost criminal customer service,These idiots shipped 2 pairs of trainers to a derelict apartment and took £150 out of my Paypal account Never checked random delivery addressWas not hacked I think it was someone on the inside of the companyNo help at all from customer serviceGot my money back from PayPal and closed my ASOS accountAbsolute incompetent idiots
"March 04, 2017",5,Never any problems,"First class always! If I ever return anything which is rare, money is quickly put in my account."
"March 03, 2017",1,Avoid,Simply avoid. You'll be lucky to get your order on time or the item to match the pictures! Very bad customer service
"March 03, 2017",4,OKAY,The delivery was in time.
"March 03, 2017",1,Shipping and Customer Service are horrible.,"I just recently started shopping at asos and absolutely love the assortment of clothing they offer. However, the shipping and customer service sucks so bad that I do not know If i will continue to shop with them. Both times I have ordered from them needing the clothing for a specific date and the package didn't arrive when it said it would. The last time I ordered from them, I even signed up for the $19, 2-day shipping for a year so I could ensure my order would arrive in time.  Two days later I went to go track my package because it said you would arrive on that day and it just shipped! I contacted customer service who basically said they couldn't do anything for me and when I asked for my $19 back they said they would refund it but cancel my yearly shipping plan?! Great customer service. Not to mention when I placed my order it told me it would be there on the day i needed it but that was obviously a lie."
"March 02, 2017",1,Poor customer service,My item was delivered late as the courier hermes lied about posting my item to meet his deadline. ASOS did not care as I informed them this was a regular occurrence and all they offered was a measly 10% discount that expires in less than a month.They clearly did not read my email as there response clearly indicated a cut  and paste standard response.
"March 01, 2017",5,10/10 best website,if only all online stores were as professional as asos. fast delivery. easy to return stuff to although it does take a while for money to get back onto card but loveee asos
"March 01, 2017",1,Untrustworthy,I never received half my order and the box that half it came in was smashed and ripped and they would not give me a refund because somehow the pictures of the destroyed box were not 'evidence' even though its very clearly damaged
"February 28, 2017",1,Worst Customer Service,"I had not received my birthday code, so I kindly asked them why and whether I could get one generated. They said because my birthday had passed(2 weeks after) I couldn't not get a code, that was not sent to me to begin with. First they claimed I wasn't opted in to emails which in my account states I am. Which is a glitch in their system but ASOS did not even apologise for their glitch at all. Another customer service staff claimed I was lying and that I had received it. It seems like they were making up excuses in which they took none of the blame. They did not even try to listen to me or help in the slightest. This is one of the worst customer service I have ever received."
"February 28, 2017",5,Amazing All-Round Experience,"To keep it short and simple:I'm not sure why so many people are complaining about poor customer service?I had a delivery half an hour ago and a brush was missing from a set I had ordered. I had a chat live to customer services at ASOS and within 5 minutes, a new one has been replaced and will arrive tomorrow, for free. And to top it off, I don't need to return the old item either. Incredibly happy with customer services at ASOS. I order from them very regularly and have had nothing but a top class experience. Good quality clothes, lots of deals, and an amazing delivery service.My only niggle would be that a few months ago I ordered a couple of items and one didn't arrive because they had sold out. I was refunded before delivery, but was a little disappointed that they let me buy it when it wasn't in stock. But haven't had that problem again."
"February 28, 2017",1,Terrible customer service; it's as if it didn't exist ...,"On the 24th of November 2016, I ordered with ASOS for the first time and what usually would have been a straight forward process of buying the clothes and then receiving them with DHL in a couple of days ... turned out to be a real mission where even customer service didn't know what had happened to the order although they were forced to get in touch with DHL itself. All in all, their customer service is very poor, as ASOS hardly replied in a timely manner ... if at all; and given the nature of having an order worth 220.-Pounds gone astray ... I would have expected a little bit more of a forthcoming attitude, initiative and most importantly better communication in solving the delay as fast as possible. What actually happened in answer to my various enquiries via e-mail which never received an answer, was simply this: ASOS simply kept altering the delivery date on their website in regards to my order and that's about it; —albeit, all items of the order were in stock at the time of purchase!Since no communication was possible and I kept receiving no replies, I was eventually forced to warn ASOS that I would issue a Paypal dispute since more than 2 weeks had passed by then with no delivery or any concrete information provided, which prompted finally a reply, which simply stated:""Thanks for getting in touch about your order 237210482 - I'm sorry you're still waiting for your goodies to arrive.I don't have all the information to hand to give you an answer right now, however I'm working with our carrier DHL to find out for you. I'll be back in touch within 48 hours with an update for you.If you have any other questions in the meantime, please don't hesitate to get back in touch.""—which, as it turned out was some kind of template answer, as I didn't hear back from ASOS concerning an update within the promised 48hrs. Fortunately 1 week later, with a total of 3 weeks waiting having passed since the date of purchase, the order was delivered after all.Three entire weeks with DHL for a shipment across Europe to Portugal; without any customer care or real assistance ... ASOS simply let the customer hanging, or wait and figure things out for himself; way to go ASOS, I'm definitely not shopping here again or even recommending this online shop further, since there exist plenty more online retailers that respect and truly value their customers."
"February 28, 2017",4,Arrived in Singapore within a week,"Placed my order on 21 Feb, items were dispatched on 22 Feb and reached me today (28 Feb). Very fast delivery. Only qualm is that the Nike Swoosh Cap in White (GBP12) I've ordered is currently on sale at GBP 9.50 (-.-"") but since I've gotten it at 18% off, oh well. It's better than in the pictures, thought it would be the ordinary rough cotton handfeel kinda material but it turned out to be quite like dri-fit material. Also bought The Ordinary Co Rose Hip Seed Oil to try. I'd recommend friends to buy from ASOS but probably only from the reputable/known brands."
"February 27, 2017",2,"Poor quality clothes, unhelpful service",Never again. Clothes look nothing like their online pictures and sending them back is a mission.
"February 27, 2017",1,Absolutely shocking customer service!,"Ordered item on Monday for next day delivery find out on Wed it's been misplaced by delivery company, rather than resolve it quickly told I have to wait up to 5 days for it to be found, wouldnt even give refund, even though I expressed the parcel was urgent. Zero fu*ks given! ***AVOID*** if you want your stuff in a hurry or even at all!"
"February 25, 2017",3,Not 100% satisfied,"I ordered a few items here and I was disappointed with a couple of them, they did not look anything like the pictures, but the other item I ordered was very nice and perfect for what I wanted it for"
"February 25, 2017",1,Horrible Service! Wrong Sizes Listed on Site,"I ordered Women's shoes in US size 5.5. They sent me the shoe in a men's 5.5 or as they called it 5 UK. I tried to explain to them that they had sent me the wrong shoe since I had ordered a women's shoe in a US size 5.5 They ignored what I was saying, told me just return them and closed ended the help chat. VERY RUDE AND UNHELPFUL. WRONG SIZES, WRONG PRODUCT, OVERPRICED!"
"February 24, 2017",1,Just terrible,"Poor customer service, they don't care at all and do what they want without asking."
"February 24, 2017",4,Decent!,They ensure the quality of products are high and their delivery is fairly quick... however sometimes it can be delayed. Reasonable prices for branded items.
"February 24, 2017",5,Asos is one of the best on line stores,"Asos is so efficient I ordered on a Friday it was with me on the Tuesday every  thing I got is what I ordered what you see online is what you get and returns are so easy they also let you know when they have recieved your returns and putting your money back in your account so quick This is going to be the shop for me from now on enjoy,so everyone you can't go wrong just give it a go"
"February 24, 2017",4,Easiest online retailer out there!,"Pros: Huge choice, really easy returns, quick postage and easy to navigate sizeCons: sizing and quality varies hugely!"
"February 23, 2017",5,Fantastic company.,I have used this company for years now and highly recommend them. Sent an item back after 28 days and still got a full refund. One necklace didn't arrive with the rest of my items. Customer service was excellent. No issue and sent me a replacement within a couple of days. I now have the premier delivery which is also great value. Sorry for the people who have had a bad experience but would definitely urge you to try them again.Love this website and will continue to buy lots more.
"February 23, 2017",2,Awful,"I use to love shopping with ASOS, but their customer service and business has gone down. I ordered a two piece outfit and was able to use a 20% off discount that they had sent me. So, all of a sudden I get an email saying the top is out of stock and the pants are on their way. They refunded me for the top. I then go to their website and see the top is still in stock. Confused? So was I. I contacted their customer service via chat and spoke with Lydia, who was very rude and defensive right off the back. She told me she couldn't give me the 20% off the top and basically deal with it, not her problem. So, they wanted me to reorder a top they cancelled that was instock for more than I previously paid for it.  I'm not a sucker and this has been a very bad experience, that has left me reconsidering shopping with ASOS in the future."
"February 23, 2017",1,Buyer Beware!!!!,company is a scam and words can't express how absolutely horrible they treat their customers as well as take your money and don't give you the merchandise. There packaging is horrible and has arrived town to pieces in the in plastic bags they use so it is very likely part or most of your order will be missing. There is no way to co tact this company other than live chat which I believe is all machine generated and the responses you receive through the live chat are identical. This has given me nightmares of having robots oversee my concerns and multiple issues I have had with this company. Buyer beware!!! You will be extremely sorry that you ever gave a penny to his company!! I am in the process of filing multiple claims to the authorities regarding their unethical and extremely
"February 23, 2017",4,Great customer service,Always helpful !
"February 22, 2017",5,Perfect.,"I feel so bad for people who have bad experiences with ASOS because I can't even imagine what it's like! I've always had really good experience with them. Beautiful and accurate shipping. I have Premier Delivery (£9.95 for the whole year? That's an amazing price) and every item I've purchased for free next day delivery has always arrived morning/early afternoon. Once, I bought a body chain/necklace and it broke as I tried to put it on after taking it out of the package. I told them about how shocked I was and asked if it was possible to get another one and they sent me one within 3 days, free of charge!Love you guys xx"
"February 21, 2017",4,Love it!,"Great clothing, variety of clothes.. too many to choose from! More sales please :)"
"February 21, 2017",1,Terrible service,Ordered for Christmas Present for my sister on th Dec now  Feb she still has not recieved it and ASOS won't give me my money back!!! they tell me someone is going to contact me and then they don't NEVER USE THESE PEOPLE! Worst service ever!!!!!!
"February 20, 2017",2,I've had some decent experiences and some appalling.,"The quality ranges so greatly, some pieces will fit well and last a few wears others can barely make it through an evening. The service when something does go wrong is brutal so make sure that what you're ordering is the perfect size (good luck with returns) and goes always to the right  (and exceptionally clear) address so that there are no hiccups. If you need customer service it won't be there for you."
"February 19, 2017",1,Unprofessional services,"Ordered a sweatshirt 3 days before Valentines day with the next day shipping and still didnt get it (it has been more than a week!!!!) Nobody seems to know where the parcel is. They give no compensation, didn't even apologize!!! Horrible!!! Never shopping via asos again!"
"February 19, 2017",3,They could be so great...,"I love the ASOS apps/website, always been a good thing to navigate but the customer service side is always just a bit off par.Every time I've had to order,  return, exchange or do something online it's been easy. I love my online account and the reward system (by the way it doesn't really make sense if you are already a premier account holder because you get most the rewards already, ie free next day delivery would be good if you could look into that) but every time I've tried to talk to the customer service department it usually takes an age to speak to someone and get an answer. SO long. That's by social media, phone, email and chat. Also, putting a link directly to 'Customer Care' not 'Help' on the main page would be so much clearer to customers."
"February 17, 2017",5,Excellent all round!,"Brilliant customer service, oders processed and delivered quickly, no quibble returns and speedy refunds. What more could you ask for! Oh, and they have the best selection of clothes and accessories in the UK!  Would recommend wholeheartedly."
"February 16, 2017",5,Why does this site have bad reviews?,"I have never had a problem with asos, I don't know why the reviews are so bad. Fast delivery, quick refunds, easy returns, good products... What more could you want?"
"February 16, 2017",2,Really disappointed,"I have shopped at asos a lot of times over the years, but the last couple of times i have been really disappointed. I have both times order a pair of ray ban sunglass, the first time  i bought a pair for a christmas gift. They arrived the day before christmas eve and was the wrong color, asos solution was to return them, not extra help or anything. I had to give the for christmas eve and had a lone chat with asos, whom just wanted to return the glass evendo i had to use the for a christmasgift otherwise they told me that they would have a problem with there inventory. I dont get how it can be my problem as a costumer? The next pair of ray bans arrived correctly but they were missing a case, i was told by someone in costumer service that the only solution was to return them if i wasn't pleased with them, they did want to send the missing case after. The sunglasses are sold out, so it is not really a solution to send them back. It is really sad to see how they have lost their good costumer service!"
"February 16, 2017",5,good company low score!!!,"WOW so you look up scam artists or crooks or criminals and they have amazing scores but a company like asos, who in my opinion use the best currier service in briton and the clothes haven't even begun to be too expensive like top man or new look or zara. the customer services are top notch and the returns policy is great. wow i just don't trust trust pilot any more!! wow SHAME ON YOU TRUSTPILOT SHAME !"
"February 15, 2017",5,Excellent experience,"Order placed at the weekend for some clothes for my daughter.  Said the order would arrive on Wednesday (today) and it was delivered before 10am with notification beforehand on my mobile phone.  Clothes fit perfectly and are good quality items and well packaged.  I was extremely nervous to place an order after a particularly horrid experience with another online clothing company, but ASOS, you have restored my faith in online shopping!  Many thanks.  Only slight criticism, it would have been useful to have had confirmation that I had placed an order, just in case anything had gone wrong and I needed to contact you.  On this occasion, nothing went wrong...a perfect transaction, just as it should be."
"February 15, 2017",1,Poor customer service,Still didn't get my refund.. really dissappointed. Won't buy from Asos again.
"February 15, 2017",5,Never fail!,"I can always count on ASOS to have what I am after. Great range and they never fail to impress me! I think the the best thing is that you can ""Save"" everything you like, which is very handy to refer back to. Everything's great from the ordering to the delivery. Thank you."
"February 15, 2017",5,Excellent service,"Never had a problem with my items, packed well and items just how described. Speedy delivery received order as standard delivery within 3-4 days. Love shopping on asos one of my fav to shop online and highly reccommend to family and friends. Thanks asos keep up the good work :) xx Fatmah B (GB)"
"February 14, 2017",1,"Don't buy from here, false advertising and RUDE customer service.","Just a quick FYI to any/ all customers reading this. Do not purchase from this company unless you have extra funds to not only pay customs charges but then to pay large sums of money to return items to them even if your reason for a return is that the item was falsely advertised on their website.I purchase 8 identical items for my wedding, used the size chart to order sizes and received items that looked NOTHING like the item that was on the website. I contacted Customer Service to see what they could do to help me out as I am in Canada and returning the items would cost me another $60. Keep in mind that the items cost $130, I had already paid $40 in customs charges that I wasn't going to get back, and the items I received looked like maternity clothing instead of the photo online that looked great.I was told ""the Manager has agreed that you can return the clothing"" ""you are responsible for the postage"" ""I have done all I can do"".I shop at ASOS all the time and am a loyal customer and they weren't even willing to work on a solution with me. Please don't trust these people with your orders."
"February 13, 2017",1,Terrible customer service,I ordered quite a few cloths when there was 20% off but one of the items was faulty with a tear in the stitching so I sent this back for a replacement but they refunded me instead. When I contacted them they said the item wasn't in stock at the time of refund but is now and offered me 10% off instead of the original 20%. Wasn't happy with that at all. Why should I have to pay more because of thier so called insufficient stock levels. Would not use this company again!
"February 10, 2017",1,Poor customer service,"I ordered 3 bags and it's been around 1 month and a half and I still didn't receive them. I contacted ASOS 2 weeks ago and they said they will investigate the issue and get back with a response. Of course, they've never sent an e-mail back. Today I contacted them again and they said the same thing. It's just a waste of time and a waste of money. I'm curious if I'll see my stuff one day.."
"February 10, 2017",1,Disgusting customer service!,"I ordered a parcel to be delivered 8 days ago, the parcel did not arrive and still hasn't, asos customer service suggested I buy the product again whilst they find out what happened. I have now spent the last week speaking to Asos customer service trying to get a refund for my original order. I have been fobbed off and told to wait whilst they investigate for over a week now and still no refund. Absolutely shocking customer service, all they do is send generic pre written messages."
"February 09, 2017",5,Always great service,Huge range of products! Never had any issues - the few returns I have made over the years were all handled well and quickly.
"February 09, 2017",4,Good!,Get good shopping experience all the time!
"February 08, 2017",5,Good first experience,Orders a jacket at 2359 yesterday and it's been hung up in my bedroom since 1928. Absolutely delighted and it fits beautifully. So chuffed to bits and was a great first experience. Will shop again.
"February 08, 2017",1,Absolute Incompetence and Terrible Service,"I ordered several (3) pairs of jeans that they advertised as in-stock on the website.  They arrived much later than the email notification specified, and then when they did come, two were the wrong style, but correct brand, and the third was not even the right brand.  I sent them back and was told that one of the 3 was actually not in stock, and they would send the correct style for the other two.  They then sent the EXACT SAME incorrect jeans a second time.  I've now alerted them to this fact, and it's been more than two weeks and they still cannot even tell me if ""the warehouse"" has the correct jeans that they are still advertising as in stock (the ones that I've already paid for).  They will respond to online chat and Twitter DM's, but everyone says the same thing:  we're waiting to hear back from the warehouse.  No action, not helpful.  There is zero excuse for a company this size having such poor inventory management and customer service. I will NEVER buy from them again."
"February 08, 2017",1,Worst customer service I have ever encountered online,"Bought 17 dresses and sent 3 items back to be exchanged for different sizes. Got a confirmation email of the exchange. Waited for a month and having not heard back, contacted them. They said that they had refunded me for the dresses due to a system error and now the dresses are out of stock. If they do come back on stock I would have to snatch them up one by one and pay 3 delivery charges when my order qualified for free delivery on the first place! Disgraceful and an absolute lack of client care. Won't be purchasing from them again!"
"February 08, 2017",1,ridiculous custom fees,"I ordered about $300 worth of clothing from asos.com. They sent my order using UPS, who is charging me $92.68 of custom fees. How on earth should I pay this ridiculous amount of custom fees? Won't shop on asos again if this is not solved."
"February 07, 2017",5,Love!,Best online site!
"February 07, 2017",5,"Never had a problem, yet.","I have been using Asos.com for over 3 years regular not once had a serious problem, whenever i have had its been dealt with accordingly by the twitter team. great service."
"February 07, 2017",1,Extremely poor service,"I ordered a number of items in the ASOS sale on a Sunday and items were due to be delivered by Hermes on Wednesday I received all the expected email confirmations and when at the end of Wednesday I still hadn't received my items I checked the tracking to find a 24 hour delay in delivery, this was a courier issue with Hermes as they had possession of my parcel.  I still hadn't received the parcel by the end of the day on Thursday and contacted customer service at ASOS as Hermes advise, emails went back and forth and they requested I allow 24 hours for them to look into it and get back to me. It's now Tuesday evening, the tracking states returned to sender as requested so confused I sent another email. The last 3 emails have gone unanswered by ASOS so I started a live chat, this has led to me being told that I will not receive my items and that I now have to wait 7 days once they receive it back from the courier, a process they say was started on the 3 Feb, to receive a refund. I informed them I found this unacceptable, the reply said they now had to close the chat!! Apparently that's how ASOS deal with their customers when they are having problems. I have no idea when I can expect my refund, they have had my money for over a week with no items being provided to me and a potential wait of another 2 weeks for my refund as they have yet to receive the parcel from the courier. They did advise that if I wanted the items I would need to re-order, I don't think so somehow!!!!!! Awful service, I can't even make a complaint as they don't respond to emails!!! Very very very poor, left with an unhappy customer!"
"February 07, 2017",1,Item damaged - Bad Customer Service - refused to replace,"I bought an ASOS Lace Trim Long Sleeve Robe - Khaki / M for my girlfriend. It arrived with what appeared to be a yellow paint stain on it. I sent it back and asked for a replacement... They gave me a refund instead. When I went online to buy the same robe it had increased in price. After 30 minutes with their customer service they would not honor the original price of the robe. I reordered the robe at a higher price because my girlfriend really wanted it, but I will NEVER order from them again."
"February 06, 2017",5,Great quality clothing,Never had ordered from this company before and they're quality of material was beautiful. It arrived on time and fit perfect! Never have I even been able to try dresses on IN STORE and have this easy of an experience. Thanks ASOS:)
"February 06, 2017",1,Shipment failure,"Apparently my parcel got lost in their shipment even though data was delivered to GLS. Now 11 days since I placed my order, still no sign of it on track and trace other than data to GLS - so still nothing done from ASOS' side. Talked with them and they promised this and that... Am going abroad now, so I won't recieve it even if it ever arrives. Such bad experience from what should be an everyday easy parcel order and delivery...."
"February 06, 2017",1,Two left feet,"I ordered a pair of high heeled sandals for a wedding in the Asos sale. When they arrived, one shoe was a size 6 as ordered, but the other was a size 8 and both for the same foot! It was in an unmarked badly damaged brown box, not the original box for the shoes, which makes me think they have been returned and not quality checked before being put back into stock. Furthermore, when I contacted Asos to make them aware of the mistake, they were incredibly dismissive. I was originally told I had a new pair of the correct shoe on it's way to me, which did puzzle me as I knew they were out of stock online. 2 days later I was finally told that they weren't 'whizzing' their way over to me, because they were out of stock. As they couldn't provide me with new shoes, they asked that I return the pair and as a gesture of goodwill because they were for a wedding, I was offered a measly 10% discount. No consolation at all considering I already get 10% off with my student card! Very poor service, very dismissive advisors, will not be shopping with them again!. Ps. Still waiting on my refund too!!"
"February 06, 2017",1,I had an AWFUL shopping experience at Asos,"I had an AWFUL shopping experience at Asos. My parcel was lost, I don't get real help from Asos, they are just telling me to call here and there, nobody tells me when (if at all) I will be refunded.  NEVER MORE asos!"
"February 06, 2017",5,Satisfied,"I must be just very lucky but out of the all the orders I placed with ASOS, I never had any issues. Everything was shipped in a timely manner (I live in Canada) and quality of the items never disappoint.  I also love how they offer 360 view on some items and short clips of models modeling the item. More companies should start doing this."
"February 05, 2017",2,Returns- Canadian consumers,"Unfortunately, ordering from Asos is very expensive for Canadian consumers. I paid $60 in customs to receive the item, which I understand is not the fault of Asos. But then to return two out of the four items that did not fit came to $98. They should really work with their international partners to facilitate free returns.  Can no longer afford to order from here."
"February 05, 2017",5,Very good,"Delivery has always arrived on time, quick refunds if anything is wrong. Good communication. Highly recommend"
"February 04, 2017",5,favourite shoppingsite,no complains :))
"February 03, 2017",5,Great service,Issues with returns but resolved quickly - staff very helpful and friendly.
"February 03, 2017",1,Wish there was a ZERO STAR rating,Appalling Customer Service and a dishonest practice being carried out there. My daughter ordered an item that was never delivered to the intended recipient and Asos/DPD claim  it has been despite not producing the requested POD.They claim that they have my daughters signature  but  she was hundreds of miles away. DPD say they have closed the case and Asos refuse to refund the money. They claim to target the 20 something age group on their website and I reckon it's because it's a vulnerable age group rather than for any other reason. I just wonder how much  money they are making from students and young people by this dishonest practice. I have read many other such reviews which is quite alarming.  In addition my daughter doesn't know what else to do and they refuse to deal with me. FUNNY THAT  !!!
"February 03, 2017",1,Very bad company!!!! Will never shop there anymore!!!!,"Waiting for refund over 2months, keep contacting their customer service via email, fb dm, live chat... They keep asking the same questions and ive been anwering millions times. End up replying me my info is incorrect which is totally not true!!!!!  Im so disappoint abt their service!!!! Dragging to refund."
"February 02, 2017",5,AMAZING,"Favorite website for clothing and sometimes gifts.I have asos premier which is amazing with how often I order stuff from it, and is only a tenner a year which is nothing.Very good prices and good quality clothes from the ASOS brand, plus so many brands to choose from. Plus there's sales on all the time.Really good clear pictures to model the clothing, and most of the time the item comes with a video of the person wearing it. Next day delivery never fails, always get happy when I receive an ASOS package.Love love love ASOS!"
"February 02, 2017",1,When will my order arrive??!!!,"Wanted two dresses for tomorrow night. I orderd them a week ago and nothing has come yet, allthough they were supposed to arrive yesterday. I contacted the Help-Team and they said they're sorry but there was a technical problem and they'll pass it on and that I will be contaced by email as soon as it's send off. Its now over 24 h ago and I haven't even recieved an email. Allthoug I said that it's very important that it arrives today or at the latest tomorrow. Never buying anything there again!"
"February 02, 2017",4,My own experience has been good,"Despite the bad reviews, for now I am going to give them some positive feedback. I have ordered some clothes and they arrived fast and in perfect shape.Let's see what happens in the future."
"February 02, 2017",1,ASOS,"Appalling customer service ,rude ,unhelpful."
"February 01, 2017",1,Really bad service,"Really bad service. Bought dress which was not like described. On messenger I described the problem in details. A long time before time until I got reply, a reply with questions that I had already described. After 6 days (Jan. 8th) they then told me they would investigate further. I have not heard anything since that. Simply not good enough."
"February 01, 2017",1,Shocking!,"I order 5 pair of shoes, upon arrival I realised that 3 of them were damaged and when I contacted customer services they were rude and completely unhelpful. I am still trying to get a refund."
"January 31, 2017",1,Asos has the worst customer service ever!,"First off, Asos doesnt have a phone number to talk to someone. You have to chat. They are super rude over chat and always state ""We cannot step out of our process to help you."" What is that?? I ordered $300 worth of clothes and used a $75 discount. I sent about $100 worth of clothes back that didn't fit. They took the entire $75 off my refund so I got about $25 back. So they just pocket my money?? I don't understand how this is legal. so angry!"
"January 30, 2017",1,Bad treatment to the workers in Asos warehouses!!,"I'm shocked after watching documentary on TV !! I feel bad ordering anything from Asos, thinking that someone is being mistreated in warehouse for my order ! I will make my journey to shop from now on! Asos just sees a numbers not people , behind the closed doors. Never gonna order from Asos again, or at least for long time ! Adrianna"
"January 30, 2017",1,"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, BAD AFTER SALES TEAM","Hi there:The reason I’m writing to you is because I am very dissapointed with the after sale customer service and extremely sad with your customer care. As a loyal customer I have experienced a bad treatment through your after sales team ( still waiting for a response, since once month) and I have tried to contact you several times regarding this complaint with no succesful communication from your side and making excuses about the busy moment during Christmas time. I bought this two items in November through your website. And expected the delivery at home. No one knocked on my door or tried to contact me on that time but the items where supposed to be ‘ posted through the letter box’ ( which I never allowed in the first place). After this I have tried to contact the company at least 7 times, via website chat, contact us and email. All of them unsuccessful and disappointing. They always said they had to investigate and never came back to me again. I have bought several items in my life in this company and I really think this is not the way to treat your customer!! I am still waiting for a response of WHERE ARE MY PRODUCTS AND WHY DIDN’T ANYONE COME BACK TO ME? Very poor customer service, difficult to contact the company and very bad after sales department. Please find here a prove for  one of that times:Hello, Thanks for taking the time to leave your feedback. Your comments will be looked at by our team to help us make improvements to our Help pages.  Please note that you won’t receive a reply from our Customer Care Team - so if you have any questions you’ll need to contact us through the Contact links on the Help page.  You can get in touch using our contact form by clicking here– we’ll get back to you via email as soon as possible. Thanks again for your feedback. Best wishes, ASOS Customer CareThey never came back to me and still waiting for a response! Shame on ASOS. Thought you had a better reputation."
"January 30, 2017",2,Shame,Terrible when it comes to customer service team. They clearly don't have any clue how to  do they job. Even less  when it comes to customers and they orders. Shame You better hope asos don't mess up...
"January 29, 2017",1,Customer Service Has Gone Downhill,"I have been ordering from Asos for 6 years now - a long time and a loyal customer. I had received wrong items in the past but they had handled it very well - sent me the correct item, no questions asked, as it should be. Recently, I noticed they changed their shipping policies. It used to be free shipping internationally, not anymore - the first red flag. Now, in my most recent order, I received the wrong item. They asked me, a customer, to go out of my way to package it, go all the way to the post office, spend my own money again and send the item back. They sent out my order again and I received the same wrong item AGAIN. I even said I would send them a picture of the wrong items with their labels as proof. After they said they would get back to me within 1-2 days, I waited TEN DAYS and then I had to email them again to see what they would do to fix the problem. They sent me the same response - send the item back. Completely unacceptable. Now the original item I ordered is out of stock in my size and it seems they are unwilling to give me a refund. NEVER order from them. They make a lot of mistakes, trust me, but now they seem unwilling to resolve customer issues (and I have been a regular customer for 6 years, they can see that in my account). In the past, they offered a 10% off coupon when they made a mistake too, now absolutely nothing even when they made the same mistake TWICE. The clothes often aren't even that nice - very hit or miss. Half the time they don't look how they do in pictures or are bad quality. Not worth the experience."
"January 29, 2017",1,"Order didn't actually go through, no contact from asos whatsoever","I recently ordered some trainers from asos, I received a paypal email confirming the order but no confirmation from asos, looking now I can see the product is out of stock, received no message letting me know the order had either gone through or then been cancelled. Very frustrating lack of contact. I have now ordered the shoes elsewhere for cheaper and I certainly won't be bothering with asos again"
"January 29, 2017",5,Highly recommend,"I've been shopping with asos for some years now and it's my preferred way to shop for fashion.Great range & good bargains to be had in their sales/outlet sections. I get free next day delivery, and returns have never been an issue. Timely refunds and no quibbles.There has been one faulty item returned, and again, no questions asked.I have communicated with the team on social media and have always had polite responses.Will continue to shop with them."
"January 29, 2017",1,WORST DELIVERY and CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Incorrect delivery timeframe was set from the time of purchase. The checkout screen displayed 4 business days for shipping and turns out this is only for US customers. I am dumbfounded to discover that their website is unable to recognise the shipping address (which in this case was CANADA), to display a shipping timeframe for Canada. So, in the end, I could not receive this parcel in time for an overseas trip I needed the parcel for! While the parcel was in transit, I contacted the customer service team THREE times, where ALL three times, they were really unhelpful, unapologetic and inconsiderate! All three time, the agent purposely ended the chat, which I felt was EXTREMELY rude! I would NEVER shop on ASOS again. The worst online shopping experience ever!"
"January 28, 2017",4,Sweat oversize grey,"Nice quality, delay was respected, very cheap ! I love ASOS !"
"January 28, 2017",5,Excellent!,This site is solid. They have great stuff and the customer service is excellent. Very happy about this website!
"January 28, 2017",3,"Acceptable, but not good...","ASOS has some good brands to offer, but when it comes to prices I think you may find cheeper out there. However, they often offer discounts. So, if you are really interested in purchasing a certain item and cannot find it elsewhere, it is a place to consider. I like saving things in my preferences and waiting for some discounts; but unfortunately I never manage to get disounts for the items I would like to purchase. Or, they get discounted when there are no sizes available. I don't get it...why discount an item that is out of stock? It makes no sense... Anyway, I did manage to make a few purchases by now, and overall I am pretty much happy with them."
"January 27, 2017",1,Wait years for the refund,"Sent the return parcel on 13 Dec and got an email saying the parcel reached their office on 3 Jan - and no refund.I contacted them on Facebook message, they are saying my name shown on account is different from the delivery name, so they requested me to update my name online before they could help. I don't get the point at all as I already provide all kinds of personal information to verify my identity. Even I'm not that person, the refund would only go to the card I paid, what's the matter? Is it a lame excuse for pending the process?I would never buy from this company again."
"January 27, 2017",1,AVOID! !!!,Still waiting for my refund . Returned more than a month ago. Absolute joke. AVOID! !!!
"January 27, 2017",1,The Worst Customer Service,"Their customer service is a joke. Every query you email them gets a copied and pasted response. I have a feeling they're not using actual human beings anymore. Even when you reply to them, it will be the exact same copied and pasted message. Good luck getting a response on Twitter. I had to wait six days for a response once. Seems the only way to get their attention is to shame them publicly on Twitter to respond back to you."
"January 26, 2017",2,Understaffed,"Very bad customer service. The staff are limited in what they are ""allowed"" to do, there phone line is GROSSLY understaffed! 10 minutes waiting for it to be answered, AND it's not freephone, so that costs the customer! Then when I comment on the length of time it took for my call to be answered I'm told they are not really set up to take high volumes of calls, there's only a few of them there . We'll surely common sense tells you that you should employ more staff to answer the phones! Your phones always got calls queueing, so get more staff for gods sake! For a company your size, get your bloody act together, think this is definitely a case of a company getting too big too fast, they just can't deal with it so the service end goes downhill!"
"January 26, 2017",1,Worst Online Experience ever,Dont pay for expedited shipping or hope that your clothes will ever come.
"January 25, 2017",1,Avoid buying from ASOS,"Avoid buying from ASOS. Worst customer service ever, I feel I've been wasting my time. After my debit card was stolen, and checking 2 fraudulent transactions on my bank statement, I immediately contacted them giving all the information they requested in order to cancel the fraudulent order. They just don't care, after a couple of days replying my messages and showing some interest, they've been ignoring me for a week now."
"January 25, 2017",5,Love this website.,Never had any problems with this website at all.
"January 24, 2017",2,Appalling,"I ordered an electronic voucher for my nephew to be delivered on a specific December date. Nothing arrived. If you want an impossible task to try your patience, find out how to call Asos - if you do, let me know. Try finding a way of complaining, just as difficult. I wrote 8 or 9 times in an attempt to get some action and nothing happened. 8 or 9 names replied but nobody owned the problem. Eventually when I threatened some poor PR, the voucher was sent, 14 days late. Appalling service from a company with no human face that doesn't care. Never will I use them again."
"January 21, 2017",5,Asos ıs the best!  İtems were excellent And shıppıng unbelıeveble fast! Great costumer service,Asos ıs best shoppıng website! Items were excellent And shıppıng was so fast 😊Plus great costumer service I love shoppıng wıth you guys
"January 20, 2017",4,Great!!!,"I really enjoyed shopping there..... they have a lot of nice clothes at accesible prices.The shipping was really ok, my order arrived two days later than it was supposed to, but the quality of the clothes was really good. I will surely buy from this site again."
"January 20, 2017",1,STAY AWAY!!!,This a horrible company. I ordered a few bridesmaids dresses from here one bridesmaid's dress smelled like smoke and the other had her belt missing. They would not just exchange the dress or send her a new belt. They had to be inconvenienced and return the dresses with a slip and then re-purchase other dresses while waiting 5 to 10 days for their money to be returned to their account from the first purchase.
"January 20, 2017",5,Excellent service! Love ASOS!,"ASOS seem to be the only online retailer who provide decent clothes for tall ladies like me. The prices are reasonable, delivery and returns quick and simple, and the only time I've had a problem it was sorted quickly and efficiently by their customer services team."
"January 18, 2017",1,When things go wrong.. They don't care!,"The first time Asos messed up my order by sending me a damaged customer return as 'new' goods, I let it slide.I even brushed it off when their customer service refused to give me any form of credit for the week that it took to get the goods replaced, despite the fact it was down to their poor quality control.Now one of the orders I placed from them has been lost. Okay, not their fault I hear you say. True.But what is their fault is their blasé attitude about it, the fact that they take days to reply to an email when I send a reply immediately after they send me an email. What is also their fault is that they do not prioritise customers when their orders are messed up. I understand that they're a student-focused brand, therefore I would expect them to employ students. But the way their customer service treat the customers, with their all year round slow communication (don't let them fool you that it's just a 'busy' period, their website says that 99% of the time - maybe hire some more staff if you're that busy guys) and their pre-typed 'I'm sorry your order was messed up but have a generic reply which doesn't apply to you emails' which do absolutely nothing to solve the situation, is just ridiculous.And yes, if they don't like your email then they will ignore you guys.Just about the only good thing about Asos is their free returns. Expect everything else to be a disaster!"
"January 18, 2017",1,First time and last time !!!,"I ordered from asos for over 1 week ago, and i dont have my package yet!I should get it for 2 days ago, and now  they tell me to Wait 1 week more!!!!I Would give Them 0 Star if i could!Poor Company.They are so poor, i Will never, never buy something from Asos again!! Poor Company Zalando is much better."
"January 18, 2017",5,"Great Return procedure, good prices on sale, great items","The return procedure is the easiest ever. Many options to choose from: click and collect, toyou.com (Asda stores), Royal mail, myhermes at home collection. The bag is resealable so you don't need to find tools to reseal everything!The items are the most original and pretty you can find out there, suitable for any style.The chat customer service is very helpful and efficient.Thanks !"
"January 18, 2017",1,"First time, last time","I ordered a good amount of items to try out from ASOS as a first-time shopper. They appealed to me because of the wide plus-size selection, reasonable shipping times, and the fact that they pay for my country's VAT and import fees. So I place my order, a week goes by...the expected delivery date comes, so I check my tracking number and nothing had been updated for 6 days (red flag #1). So I wait a bit for the Post to come by my building and maybe ring me to alert me of a package...instead I received an email that ASOS received my return package and will process my requested refund (red flag #2). Note that I never even received the package! How could I possibly request a refund for items I haven't tried yet? So I used their Chat system and while the representative was kind, it was a waste of time. They said something went wrong during shipping and the package came back so they issued a refund right away instead of alerting the customer of a problem (red flag #3). They also said that if I still want the items I can just place a new order. Mind you, when most stores encounter my negative customer experiences, they offer compensation for the difficulties: free shipping, or a coupon code, or a discount on one or two items. A small something to ease the frustration of my purchase going south. But do they seriously think I'm going to give them more money when they did nothing to ease that frustration, especially as a first-time buyer? Nice try."
"January 18, 2017",5,Amazing,"I have been shopping on ASOS for over 5 years! Refunds are easy to process, payment comes back into account on time, items are packed well and delivery updates are sent to your phone instantly. Amazing clothes and bags. Love ASOS!"
"January 17, 2017",1,BEWARE: I would give them 0 stars if I could!,"This company is built on lies and avoiding contact with its customers.  When you purchase items from them with 4 day shipping they'll assure you that they will have your order delivered by a certain date. It won't arrive, it won't arrive a week late, but more like 2 to 3 weeks late.  The company will do absolutely nothing about this except send you emails stating ""I see your package is on its way, sorry for the delay!"". And then when you call the shipping facility after 2 weeks of no delivery, the shipping facility will tell you the package wasn't sent yet and in fact all that was done was electronic shipping information was created.  It is not and will never be worth ordering anything from this company!"
"January 17, 2017",1,Bade sizeguides,"Bad service, bad selection of brands, bad slow delivery and a terrible size guide."
"January 17, 2017",5,Great service as always,Ordered my daughter some clothes last minute in preparation for Xmas.Without exception each parcel arrived the next day and apart from a couple of items all the clothes were true to their photos on the website.My daughter was thrilled with the jeans and other clothes I bought her and returning unwanted items was simple and I received a full refund very quickly.I find Asos has something for everyone and their service is quick and efficient. Their sales are great and I've never had an issue with the quality with any products.
"January 17, 2017",1,Horrible,"First time ordering..first off it took them 7-8 days just to put my order in the mail. Second I receive the package and it looks like someone was playing football with it. It is torn on both sides, taped together, huge tears in it. I open up the package to see 2 of my 3 items missing from it PLUS the one item that was still there (a pair of adidas) shoes looked worn and box was torn. Worst packaging I have ever seen. I was so upset and coincidentally there is no number or CONTACT US area on their website. How convenient! Every company has a way to contact. When I click on my order there is no place that says ""PROBLEM WITH ORDER"" like other websites have. They do this for a reason people. I will never order from them again. I called and called and have not been helped or even apologized to. This was a xmas gift and now it has only left me without the gift after waiting weeks and with extra stress  and an issue to spend hours trying to resolve. So far, horrible customer service! I know they have cute products but please please SHOP ELSEWHERE! you will thank me later"
"January 17, 2017",1,"Unhelpful customer service, terrible policies","ASOS would not let me cancel an order I made less than two hours prior, that had not been processed. It was the incorrect item, and it would have been very easy to cancel the order and keep me as a customer. Instead, due to their arbitrary customer policies and unhelpful service, I will not be shopping with them again. It's a shame they have so little concern and respect for customers."
"January 16, 2017",5,The best,ASOS is my favourite online shop. Never had problems with their customer service as they are really quick at answering and solving the issue. I'm using twitter's customer service.
"January 16, 2017",1,ASOS IS THE WORST ONLINE RETAILER,"I advise anyone not to shop online at ASOS. Simply stay away from them, don't waste your time and most importantly don't waste your money."
"January 15, 2017",5,Always happy!,"I've used ASOS for years, and never had a problem at all. Returns quick and easy and always receive a refund quickly, always get a proof of postage just in case though. I've had experience with their customer service and no complaints there either!"
"January 15, 2017",1,Sold broken earrings,"I do not suggest ordering jewelry from this website. I got a pair of earrings that were packed to look normal, when in truth they were broken.  And it was factory packaging, not transportation one. As a solution for this problem, I go 10% discount. Are you kidding me?"
"January 14, 2017",1,"Can't believe how rude the customer service staff was... (Seeing the low score on social media and trustpilot, I don't feel too surprised now)","I have ordered a lipstick and I have received the wrong color for 3 consecutive times. At first I thought it's just a random error, but upon I received the wrong item again I started to suspect there is probably something wrong with product SKU. So I chatted with the CS,  sked whether there would be someone manually check whether it's a correct item before they posted it again, they just tried to avoid that question and  insist what I ordered should be what I received. OK...so the third time, I still got the wrong item, thanks. And I chatted with the CS again, and you know what, she immediately asked me to return the item and not order this again. I said I need this in urgent actually it's unacceptable that you need to ask your customer to go through all the hassles again communicating and returning, and never be able to get the correct item !  ASOS do need  to compensate customers' loss with this. And unbelievably the CS asked ""Can you please tell me what loss you've incurred as a result of the incorrect item being sent to you?"" which sounds so unfriendly and rude - do they think the time i used on all the hassles wasn't a loss? I need that for an important event and now I didn't manage to have it on time. It spent me 2 weeks trying to sort things out. And then ridiculously she said she had to end the chat."
"January 13, 2017",1,Shockingly bad customer service.,"I placed an order and paid for next day delivery...They lost the parcel and really didn't care. If it wasn't an £80 pair of trainers for my son's 16th birthday I would probably have told them to stick it! You can only get hold of them via email, Facebook or Twitter...They have no phone line they will give out the number for...They take 48 hours to answer emails and the replies you get all contradict each other....NEVER again will I order from them! Everyone makes mistakes but when they can't be bothered to sort out their mistakes I think it says a lot about a company...And I certainly won't be giving them another penny of my money!"
"January 13, 2017",1,"A shockingly bad ASOS movie- Cue lost package, robotic, untrustworthy, strange service","Situation: Sitting in a hotel out of town when I see package has been delivered to my building and I signed for it. Arrive at home days later to see note saying package is in the bin outside of my building, but don't find package.Rising Action: Explain to Asos customer service that I was out of town, my signature was forged, neighbours didn't sign for package, received DPD note saying that package was in the bin outside, and I could't find the package. Asos customer service say they will thoroughly investigate in 48 hours. I patiently wait for someone to contact me asking for evidence that I was away, and my signature was forged by driver, and my package was left in a bin.Climax: Asos get back to me about 2 weeks later saying that the drivers GPS shows that the package was delivered and I signed for it. Shocked and outraged, I explain that no one contacted me to ask for the hotel invoice or images of my actual signature that show that I was out of town and my signature was forged. Even stranger, why did the driver leave a note saying that my package was in the bin if I signed for it?Falling action: Skynet takes over asos customer service, they disregard the actual evidence, and respond to all my questions by saying ""We are unable to process this further, the investigation was thorough, the case is closed""Catastrophe: DPD says asos is responsible and I should raise a claim with them. Bank says they can't refund me because I paid by debit card. Asos ""skynet"" says their investigation was ""thorough"" and the case is closed. My bank account is a few hundred pounds lighter.Conclusion: At asos, the customer comes last, skynet has taken over asos's customer service, once a case is closed it has completely vanished from all existence, and Never shop with ASOS !!P.S. Chat transcripts available, trust pilot really needs a 0 star rating."
"January 12, 2017",1,Awful experience,"I would not even give one star for this company.  Parcel did not arrive. No follow up, no feedback, if I had not have made at least 6 calls I would not have received a refund. Do not bother trying to correspond via facebook or the chat line they do not care. The chat box online has no communication with their call centre!  Each call promised a response within 48 hours and a week later I am still waiting!  I even wrote to the CEO of asos and did not receive the courtesy of any response."
"January 12, 2017",5,Love this site,"I have ordered stuff from asos many times and they have never failed me. I don'y understand how most of the reviews are so bad? For me, the orders arrive in just a few days even though I don't even live in the UK. You can always track your order and the clothes are always in perfect condition."
"January 10, 2017",5,Always use them,Use asos all the time products are always good quality and delivery's good only had one issue (which was down to royal mail losing the parcel) but asos sent me a replacement and refunded me once I'd returned the items because i no longer needed them have ordered from there since and had no problems :) They also stock really nice lingerie for dd+!!
"January 10, 2017",2,Shoe size not correct,Ordered some shoes. When received the shoe size on the box was what I had ordered but the actual size on the shoe was a lot different (smaller). Their imperial to metric sizes need reviewing. I'll think twice before ordering anything again!
"January 10, 2017",1,Delivery and Customer service a joke,"They have taken my money, promised me online shopping and shipping to my delivery address. 2 weeks later no one at customer service has responded, they have my money and goods, they are thieves.  They are no longer the company I have supported and shopped from in the last 10 years. Asos your have stolen my money by not getting back in touch by not delivering my goods to me. I want my money back. Thieves"
"January 09, 2017",5,Frequent asos user,"I am a regular asos user, at least once a month usually more! I have never had a problem. Ordering is easy, delivery fast and refund prompt without hassle. I would recommend."
"January 09, 2017",5,ASOS is my #1 online shopping option!,"Perhaps most people come to this website to complain about their bad experiences (as I am about to do in regards to Topshop), because I've never had one bad experience with Asos!I've been ordering things from Asos.com regularly since 2012, and I've never been happier with an online retailer's performance. Every one of my orders has arrived, on time 99% of the time, and there has never been an issue with the items, packaging or payment. Asos currently offers free returns from Australia-which is a service I hope they will continue to provide.A couple of weeks ago I made a purchase of about 6 items, and I decided to return 3 of them via 'Parcelpoint', a free returns service offered on the Asos website. All I had to do was put the items back in their original packaging, reseal the bag (with a clever sticker that is already included), book the return with Parcelpoint, print off the label and tape it on, and drop the  parcel off at one of the numerous Parcelpoint locations near me. I received a full refund through Paypal no more than 3 days later. A bra I sent back didn't even have the tag on anymore (I took it off by mistake), and yet Asos accepted the return, no questions asked.I've recommended Asos to all my friends and family, and will continue to shop there in the future! It's surprising and disappointing to see that not everyone has had so many easy experiences with the company as I have."
"January 09, 2017",4,Good delivery options,"I'm fairly rural and don't have a lot of time to go clothes shopping in bigger cities. I like the delivery options from ASOS - one click and I can expect my parcel within a day, and it can even be sent to the corner shop in the village for me to pick up. Makes returns easy too."
"January 08, 2017",5,Excellent!,Brilliant company! Amazing deals!
"January 07, 2017",5,Excellent service!,Excellent service- whether ordering or returning goods always a seamless experience! Had to contact customer service recently and found it to be very efficient
"January 07, 2017",1,The worst customer service ever,"ASOS is great if everything is going ok. However, if something goes wrong then prepare to fall into a deep pit of the darkest despair. They can only be contacted by email, Facebook or live chat. The only people that can deal with complaints are the call handlers meaning that they just tell you what they can't do, there's no way of getting anything but the most basic problems resolved and worse of all, no one takes ownership of a query. I've spoken to countless people over several weeks, none of whom read the whole thread before responding and meaning that someone will ask a question, you reply instantly, then need to wait another 48hours (at least) for SOMEONE ELSE to pick it up and ask something totally unrelated as they have not bothered seeing what went before. Their Facebook page is full of people complaining as it's the only way to get a response and it sounds like a lot of them have it a lot worse than me, but I can assure you it will be the last time I ever use the site."
"January 07, 2017",1,Fraud fraud fraud!!! :(,"I ordered a pair of $100 adidas shoes for my mother in law at the beginning of December as a Christmas gift. Here we are, January 7, and I still do not have the shoes, asos has not provided me with tracking or a refund. I have sent multiple emails asking where my package is and all they can respond with is ""our team is looking into it and will get back to you within 48 hours. Guess what- I've been asking where my order is for weeks now. My mom ordered two pairs of shoes from them and both arrived with such battered and beaten shoe boxes that you would have thought they came from goodwill and have been there since 1970. AND they were both the wrong sizes she ordered.I am so upset that asos has made no effort to refund me or AT THE VERY LEAST figure out where my package is. It has been a month since I placed the order and they charged me."
"January 06, 2017",1,AVOID ASOS! - worst online store ever,Ordered a few items on Dec 12th. It is now Jan 6th and have not received it. THEY LOST IT! I emailed and chatted with their customer service and they kept telling me to wait and wait. I had enough and told them to give me a refund. Now they are telling me to wait 5-10 days for the refund..... It has been 4 days now... Let's see how long it takes for them to give my refund.
"January 06, 2017",2,Delivery service sucks...,"I ordered a dress December 2016, I paid for the two day delivery service so I was suppose to receive the package in 2016. When I contact them about it the lady I spoke with said that the package is in America but and is delayed at the ups office. She said I would receive the package no later than January 3rd 2016. I didn't receive the package so I reached out to them again, this time I spoke to Robert, he said the package is still at the ups sorting office in Kentucky, and I should give them a day to see what's the hold up. So I took the initiative to call the ups headquarters to see why was there a delay. Someone at the ups headquarters said that the package did not leave GB. So ASOS this is for you. I'VE BEEN A LOYAL CUSTOMER FOR 3 YEARS AND, BUT YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PACKAGE AND I WOULD LIKE A FULL REFUND SINCE I DIDN'T RECEIVE MY PACKAGE AS YET AND IF I DONT GET MY BACK BY THE 1/9/2017. TRUST ME I AM GOING TO SUE YOU GUYS."
"January 06, 2017",1,ASOS Voucher Debacle....AVOID!!!,"Bought an ASOS gift voucher for a family member as a gift, for delivery via email on Christmas day (2016). ASOS took the money promptly from my bank account mid December on the day I ordered the voucher (funny how this always works without a ""glitch""). When I ordered the voucher online using ASOS website I scheduled an email delivery of the voucher on Christmas day...it was a gift after all. At the point of order, no indication of any problems or that delivery of an email would be a problem. Come Christmas day, no sign of the voucher email, same on Boxing day. So I contacted ASOS customer support and was told emails can arrive up to 24 hours after the day they were supposed to be delivered......uuummm..... I thought traditional mail can be delayed, wasn't aware that email can take 24hours, maybe the internet was taking a holiday!! Anyway ASOS then contacted me again on the 27th telling me a different story, this time they announced they had a ""glitch"" that affected their email service. In other words their IT system didn't work. I'm sure i'm not the only one affected by the ASOS email ""glitch"".My advice to anyone considering buying an email voucher is DONT BOTHER.....ASOS service is a joke, they couldn't even manage to deliver an email on time....they mess up a Christmas gift and offer up nothing more that a pathetic excuse for a sorry."
"January 06, 2017",5,All time favourite.,"I love Asos. I ordered some things at 9:30pm last night, and they arrived by 12:46pm today. I paid £9.95 for the next day delivery for a year (in itself, amazing). It was just so fast, I felt like I needed to praise them as my clothes arrived on the same day as something I had ordered from amazon 3 whole weeks ago. They've also introduced points/vouchers which I think is ace, I order the majority of my wardrobe from ASOS as I'm so busy I rarely have the time to shop, meaning I earn myself vouchers for money off my orders! They also have such a wide range, petite and tall brands, and their marketplace. I don't have a bad word to say about Asos. So much so, my friend needed to do a presentation about a website for a job interview, and I was helping her with it and told her to do Asos because I had endless things to say about the website (yes, she got the job!)."
"January 05, 2017",1,Rude poor,This company is a low company manager is a liar its a small company only few ppl work there but they lie a lot if you don't get a item you order they will not refund and if you want  to return the the item you will not able to even though it says on the website remember asos is only an online company and also they sell fake stuff because my mate compered some clothes from there do not order you will regret specially the stuff acts like there dealing with you but reality they aren't you will not be able to get refund or return the item they will twist things and at the end no return or no refund
"January 05, 2017",1,Awful experience,"Still waiting for refunds after the parcels were collected by mid December last year.Their chat is a joke, and a very bad, not funny one: they connect you through and then they leave you hanging in there, no one ever replies (still running now, over 46 minutes with 'Amber').This is the last time I'll ever use this company, going to open a formal complaint with the bank and credit card.Avoid at all costs."
"January 05, 2017",5,Excellent,I think ASOS are truly brilliant company.  Delivery & returns are excellent and the quality of the products are always spot on.  The website is clear and easy to use and i especially like to see a video of the item being modelled.  The only  down side is that I don't go to the shops anymore and its too easy to buy something fantastic.
"January 05, 2017",2,Delayed Delivery,"The last two orders I have had from ASOS which were meant to be delivered the Next Day have both been delayed over 5 days. I'm actually still waiting for the last one. They're not been able to cope with the Christmas rush at all, Really disappointing."
"January 05, 2017",1,Delivery,"You make one typo in the delivery address and guess what? You can't edit it, asos can't amend it for you, they won't even contact Hermes ( the delivery company that can only be contacted by the retailer and not the customer according to hermes) to change the address. I sent them a query right after i made the order, and they still couldn't help me. Told me that the parcel will probably be sent back and get refunded, then you can reorder the product again if it was still in stock. I contacted Hermes and they said that only the retailer can fix this problem. Umm? This is ridiculous? I felt like Asos ""customer care"" made little effort to help me and didnt really ""care"" about the situation. I'm pretty sure that there is a lot they can do to help me but they obviously couldn't care less about customer experience. I don't think I will ever order from Asos again which is disappointing because I'm a regular."
"January 05, 2017",1,The page said that my item was deli …,The page said that my item was delivered but I never receive it was 130 dollars.. such a bad service also they told me they would give me news about my order in 24h is been a week and haven't receive any news.
"January 04, 2017",1,"Terrible - missing orders, dismissive staff, charged for cancelled orders","I ordered a voucher for my sister's xmas present to be delivered by email on the 25th, however she did not get the voucher until the 29th. Why is a mystery - it was literally just a voucher to be sent to her email address. The response I received from ASOS customer service (eventually after chasing for 4 days) was 'she has the voucher now' - kind of takes something away from a xmas present when it's delivered 4 days late! And I have never received an apology or a response to any email since then. I do not know why they offer the option of sending the email on a certain date if they are unable to do so. Beware if you are sending someone a voucher as a present!At the same time I made and cancelled another order (within 5 minutes) of actual clothes for someone else. 5 minutes is well within the hour turnaround for cancelling orders - yet my bank account has been charged. When I tried to find out why some 'customer service' adviser on their webchat told me I would get my money back within 5 days and then cancelled the chat. Unbelievable.I've been a loyal customer for years - but this is the last straw. AVOID this website - it's not worth it!"
"January 04, 2017",2,Can they be trusted?,"I had ordered a jacket which was great style and condition but too large so I returned it by booking with Hermes courier service. They claim the item was not received and no refund has been issued! Beware when making online returns, as a customer all trust is with the company. Can they be trusted... Seems not."
"January 04, 2017",5,Excellent,"Everything is excellent! Products are in very good quality, delivery is always extremely fast and their customer service is perfect. I'm sooo happy with my new delivery today *****"
"January 04, 2017",1,They are scamming people!!,"I ordered items for almost 100 euros today. To hours later I wanted to buy an additional item (and therefor spend even more money). But because this item was only 25 euros, I'd have to pay delivery fee.So I contact their so-called customer service, and ask them to treat it as one order, so I can save the delivery fee, because I just placed an order for 100 euros.But according to Nabinul, who had a hard time understanding me and answering my questions, that was just too bad for me. It was two orders, and even though he/she could see that I actually have placed an order way over the minimum, I now had to pay the extra fee. And then he/she advised me to think twice before placing an order next time and just closed the chatting window down.WHAT THE F***? I've never experienced such an small way of thinking and I feel scammed. I've been a customer for so long and spend a huge amount of money, and now, they won't even do the effort and help a customer. It's rude and totally stupid that you have to pay extra money when you actually just want to buy more stuff. It's scamming people!Maybe the online customer ""service""is people from India or an isolated island in the middle of no where. Because I've never seen such a poor customer service.Never again!"
"January 04, 2017",1,asos should be investigated for fraud,"Placed an order was told it would be with me on or before the 30th of december , Nothing! Got in touch via email as I cannot find a contact number was told my order had disappeared from the face of the earth even though it has a tracker.And now silence....... Never will I trust online shopping from an unknown source again."
"January 04, 2017",4,Amazing site but poor refund/return times.,Been a shopper on here for 10 years now and probably spent thousands on there. Their clothing selections are amazing and I cannot fault the site at all in terms of products and the free postage and return service.Only downside to asos is when sending a package back it can take anywhere from 2-4 weeks to get refunded.If they were able to improve on the refund/return rate they would be second to none as the best all round clothing site on the net.
"January 04, 2017",1,SCAM WEBSITE,It's surprising they're even in business from a legal stand point. 1 star is way more than they deserve. a. they lie about shipping dates if you ever even get your packageb. their products are usually faulty c. customer service is basically non-existentVery disappointed that a UK store could be so unethical.
"January 04, 2017",5,I love them,"I've never had a negative experience with them, ever! Free shipping and returns on any item, amazing and fast customer service, and a 30 min cancellation window. I've loved every single piece I've ordered, apart from this one pair of jeans that fit me strangely but, I sent it back and got a full refund. LOVE IT!"
"January 03, 2017",1,worst company ever,"Instead of a trench coat, they sent me a skirt! What a disaster! I won't  be buying anything else from this company again!"

"January 03, 2017",1,THE WORST COMPANY - DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM.,"This company is a JOKE. Not only do they scam you and charge your account more than once, mess up your orders, they also refuse to admit such faulty orders and therefore do not refund you your money. I purchased ONE coat from them, was charged THREE times and refunded TWICE. They are now refusing to refund me the faulty third charge. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. IT ISN'T WORTH IT AND IT'S SUCH A HEADACHE. THEY STOLE $100 FROM ME."
"January 03, 2017",1,Long but thorough anecdote of poor asos cust. svc.,"I just sent the following message to asos. I don't expect to hear anything useful back:I am shocked and disturbed by the rude and unhelpful customer service I have received from asos, both in the non-delivery of my Christmas gift items with no notification, and in the below chat, which the asos customer service rep suddenly ended when I requested to speak with an asos employee with more authority to compensate for the inconvenience caused. Please see the chat in full below (For clarification, the representative did not believe me regarding notifications I did/didn't receive until I sent him a screenshot showing that indeed, I was telling the truth--""Michael.docx""):Hi, you're through to ASOS!

I finally gave up.ReceivedWe sent you a notification once it got back to us letting you know we received your order.Between 21 December and 23 December, I received absolutely no notification via text or email to advise that my order was returned to senderReceivedIf I had received such, I would've made other arrangements.ReceivedOkay sorry you didn't get the email, the tracking however had this information available to youThe first communication I received of any kind regarding this order occurred on 28 December (last Wednesday), from Collect+, stating that my parcel had arrivedReceivedUnfortunately, a belated apology and acknowledgment that I received no notification that my item was returned to sender does not really help with the fact that I went home to my family empty-handed for ChristmasReceivedCan asos offer any sort of voucher for this poor service and inconvenience?ReceivedI have been an extremely loyal customer of asos for the past 6+ yearsReceivedFYI, I believe the parcel, is still waiting at the collect+ location I selectedReceivedSadly I'm not able to give you a promo code.

"January 02, 2017",1,9 weeks later and still no refund for an item I did not receive.,"I placed an order on 29/10/2016 for an item and selected next day delivery. The item was not delivered to my home, neither was it left with a neighbour or in a safe place. It was signed for by someone I do not know. I contacted asos immediately on 30/10/2016 and was told they would look into this with the courier. I have contacted asos multiple times since and receive the same generic email stating they are still chasing up things with the courier, even NINE WEEKS LATER. I was a loyal asos customer who would place orders at least fortnightly and have received appalling and disgraceful customer service. I informed them that I will now be seeking legal advice and received the same generic email, yet again. Do not order from this company, or you risk paying for an item you will never receive."
"January 02, 2017",1,Defective item,"I bought a pair Pieces brand of ankle boots couple of months ago as I needed them so urgently I put them on straight away without even looking at the quality. So basically, shoes are really my type, my design, however, they paint my socks, all different colour sock now are either black or dark blue! also there are accessories on both shoes, one on the left leg is looking outside and on the right - inside, not in the same position as on the right one it should be outside as well. horrible horrible shoes. I couldnt return it as already wore them a number of times because I needed them really badly..and most disappointing thing is I paid £70!!! so sad..."

And in the meantime I kissed my money goodbye.The worst? because this is not a parcel that I did not receive, but that THEY did not receive, I can't even claim the money with the credit card.Avoid at all costs, make yourself a favour.

"mber 28, 2016",1,Dpd dreadful,"I'm writing to you because I'm so upset about my parcel from Asos not being delivered as promised on Christmas Eve.  I was told in an email to wait in began 6am and 10pm and to expect the delivery during that time. So I did.  At 5pm I noticed I had an email from yourselves to say that the driver couldn't find my house and so the parcel would not be delivered.  I phoned your team to ask what on earth had happened and why I hadn't been phoned for instructions.  A member of your team said that the driver had finished work and was not available.  This was at 5pm so why was I being expected to wait till 10pm? I know that my parcel number was linked to my phone number so why no phone call?  The woman in your help desk then asked me for further instructions to get to my house. I said that I didn't want the parcel delivered any more.  The parcel obviously contained Xmas presents and it would be too late by the time she'd rescheduled the delivery.  I had bought them only because they could be delivered on Xmas day otherwise I would have gone to the shops.  The woman on the phone said she would be able to help me of I gave her further instructions, so I did.  I continued to wait for the parcel and it never arrived.  I checked my email and it said that my parcel had been re-scheduled for 28th January. So the woman in your offices completely ignored my request to not have it delivered and re-scheduled it! So due to the complete incompetence of your driver I don't have Christmas presents for my son's on Xmas day. And due to the deceitfulness of your office worker I am expected to receive the parcel and send it back to Asos myself! !!!I want to make it really clear.  I DO NOT WANT THE PARCEL any more.  The deal was I had it on Xmas eve.  YOUR company failed to do this.  It is your company's responsibility to take it back to Asos, not mine.  You need to sort this out.  Not me.  Your company has already ruined my Christmas.  Here I am on Xmas morning writing this email.  I work so hard all year and I don't deserve this.  I would never have done what your driver did.  I would have kept to my promise and delivered the parcel come what may.  I would have considered that inside was someone's Christmas present."
"mber 28, 2016",5,Great service!,"I really don't understand all of the bad reviews. I must of ordered from this site over 25 times and I have never had a problem. Next day delivery is always next day, their customer service is excellent and there is constant communication of your order/return status. Fab company!"
"mber 27, 2016",1,Shameful service from an international company,"It has now become clear from social media reports that this company is having a major problem with electronic delivery of the ASOS vouchers. The high seasonal demand seems to have caused their IT system to melt down. I ordered vouchers for two of my nephews at the beginning of December for email delivery on Christmas day. The money was debited from my account immediately. It is now 27 Dec and neither of the vouchers have arrived. The Customer Services Centre has been worse than useless in providing information as to what is happening. I sent them an on-line enquiry on Boxing Day and other than an automated response I have heard nothing. The website does not provide any information on the fault, nor does it provide a telephone number to contact to Customer Services directly. Social media fairs no better in getting information as to when the vouchers will be delivered. There seems to be no back up plan to deal with this eventuality and for a major on-line retailer this is totally unacceptable."
"mber 27, 2016",1,Are they scammers?,Ordered and paid for voucher on 11th December to be delivered Christmas Day. Evening of 27th December - still not delivered - 6 calls later! They say please wait another 24 hours. Beginning to lose confidence in the company - luckily I paid by credit card!
"mber 27, 2016",1,Such an unbelievablely bad service over the Christmas..never again..,So  I am out of the country at the moment and have no access to a computer  or keyboard so am having to use my phone to get this Asos review up online as I feel it is very important. SO here I am once again waiting on a reply from Asos...this time to last nights late but ultimately pointless correspondance...in which they said they wouls sort out my 3 day wait for a voucher to be delivered to my partner on Christmas day...it is now the 27th and nothingStill  No response or resolution to the previous emails. I had sent either...this is day three now. I know its a bank holiday.. and expect a similar bad  treatment.And If that is the case then why bother to have repied at all to any emails last night.. it has not given me any piece of mind whatsoever and here I am back at square one.. Monday December 27th 2016. I Have come to the end of the rope with the length they will go to give you the run around..with very little in way of excuses or apologies...its beyond me as to why they think they have a right to treat loyal customers so badly. This is not good enough..and giving everyone the run around 3 days straight is beyond bad customer service...Asos are a multinational  company and using a glitch as an excuse really doesnt cut it not in this day and age...especially over christmas .. I work for a multinational media company that deals with technology on a day to day basis If you cannot fulfil your promises..because of a system that cannot cope with the strain then do not offer the service...at all. ....its just totally inexcusable and inept laziness..here with an utter contempt for the customer. If I could give Asos a zero or a minus I would..and from what I am reading about their lack of compensation I am disgusted..there needs to be some sort of review through off com or trading standards and would recommend everyone here complain to a Sophie Winchester through the resolver website..... and all this because of Gift vouchers...it shows Asos lack of compassion for their own customers... and a lack of loyalty themselves to their own customers. .they are happy to take money but not to resolve issues..
"mber 27, 2016",1,Terrible,"The ASOS online chat customer service is terrible. I spoke to HAILIE in regards to my delivery coming late. She messaged a response saying that it will turn up tomorrow and then messaged ""I'm going to have to end the chat now"" and then proceeded to end the chat. I understand its Christmas time and there will be an influx in sales and deliveries but that is why 99% of other companies employ additional staff for the Christmas period so they can manage the load. I'm not happy with ASOS."
"mber 27, 2016",1,Shocking disregard for customers,I ordered a gift voucher for my son in law for Christmas. He got no email on the 25th which disappointed both of us. I emailed ASOS mid afternoon on 25th and got an auto response saying I would get a reply soon and no need to contact them again. It is the 27th and still no reply to that email nor an email with the gift voucher.I have just been in contact via chat to be told they have a technical problem and they hope to send the voucher within 48 hours!!! That will be 4 days late.  I asked for compensation for this delay but they said they don't give compensation. What sort of customer service is that? The delay is their fault - they should offer compensation for the inconvenience and disappointment. I will never order ASOS gift vouchers again.
"mber 26, 2016",1,Contempt for customers,"Shocking contempt for customers during their Christmas voucher saga. Vouchers weren't delivered on Christmas day as expected. Told to wait up to 24 hours, with no specific time given. Then told apologies for the 'confusion' and to wait up to 48 hours, again with no time or reason given other than an 'glitch'. I think they're just making up numbers at this point. So many people left disappointed or embarrassed receiving / giving an ASOS e-voucher for Christmas. Retailers love vouchers as it's immediate cash in their pockets, however, their contempt for customers when fixing the problem is disgusting. ASOS are forgetting (or don't seem to care) that the people who have asked for ASOS vouchers are likely to be some of their most loyal customers, who were looking forward to shopping the sale online. It's now almost the 27th December and most of the best sale items are sold out - meaning anyone receiving vouchers has missed out. However, they're refusing to acknowledge or respond to demands for compensation. They seem determined to make every PR mistake in the book. They should offer all affected a 50% off code so that they can enjoy the perks of the sale when their voucher eventually comes through. You'd think I'd asked them for their first born child, all I'd asked is for them to recreate the same situation I would have been in if I'd received if my voucher on time! They don't seem to understand that this mistake should be rectified at their loss, and not that of their customers.They need to put their hands up, apologise and go beyond just trying to shut up their customers. We're talking about people's Christmas presents, they need to delight their customers at this point!"
"mber 26, 2016",2,So frustrating,I've been a customer of asos for probably 8 years. Tried to place 4 orders over the past few months and not one of them went through. Doubt and triple checked it wasn't my card or my bank (used different cards and banks for two of the times) and it WASNT. Tried very very hard to contact customer service and they do not have a customer service number which is honestly crazy. If you want a problem resolved you just have to wait DAYS until all of your Facebook messages are answered. THEN they tell you over and over again that it was a problem with the card. The problem is with their website and customer service. So disappointing. Get it together ASOS.
"mber 24, 2016",4,Great,"Easy purchasing, fast delivery and easy returns Thanks ASOS"
"mber 24, 2016",1,"Love Asos, but change your courier from DPD as they let you down","I have never experienced a bigger failure of a business in all of my life. I can honestly say the staff do not know what they are doing, the  management cannot tell the truth nor can you hope to ever receive the goods you have paid for ina timely fashion or wihout an argument.I have made two purchases this week, one via ASOS, the other Andertons. Both deliveries being my sons Christmas presents which I sadly needed to buy online as I was too poorly to go out to the shops. On the 22nd December I had confirmation my parcels would arrive between 1-2pm on the 23rd December. I waited in. No delivery, no call from DPD. I checked the online status of my orders, it read not able to deliver today, driver could not locate, update to follow, or words to that effect! So, frustrated my son's presents would not arrive in time for Christmas I call DPD. I was on hold for some 45 minutes but spoke with Brad. I explained the sitation. After some discussion, I was told he would upgrade me (how this is an upgrade I do not know given they had failed already to deliver my items) and that my items would be delivered between 8:30AM and 10:30AM on the 24th of December Chistmas Eve. To ensure that this would happen I asked to speak to a manager. I was told a call back from the manager would be received within 4 hours. At approximately 6PM I received a call from Anne. She apologised, agreed that somebody should have contacted me to ask for directions, and apologised for the lack of communication. She also confirmed the ""upgrade"" and that my items would be with me the following morning. At this point I accepted there was nothing else I can do but to wait as the only alternative Brad suggested was to travel from Doncaster to Lincoln to collect the parcels myself. 10:30AM Christmas Eve, no deliveries. I called DPD once again and was on hold for 45 minutes, the call in total took 1 hour and 15 minutes. On this occasion I spoke with Craig, he told me that my items were still actually in Lincoln and that they had not left as promised.I asked to speak to the manager once again.Craig told me that it was a 4 hour wait for a manager call back, I did not accept this and after a few words I was reconnected to the manager Anne who I spoke with the night before.She also confirmed that my item was still in Lincoln. She related to the Asos parcel. I explained once again that there was two parcels one from Asos the other from Andertons and that they fully aware of this as I had received updated email confirmation for both parcels this morning. Anne said she would authorise a third party courier at their expense, CitySprint. However this would only relate to the Asos parcel, the Andertons parcel was now locked in a trailer and Human Resources would only be able to access this on Wednesday the 28th of December. Clearly at this stage I was very unhappy and angry knowing my son would not receive his main present at Christmas. Anne said that she would contact Andertons as would I, Anne rang me back about half an hour later and told me that CitySprint would deliver my Asos parcel within two hours.By my calculations this would be 2PM. She also told me that she could not speak to Andertons as they were only open on a week day but that she had left a voicemail message. I explained that this was odd as I had already spoken to them myself, I spoke with a very helpful person named Matt Beasley. Matt also contacted DPD to help me, surprisingly he was told that both parcels were actually together and that CitySprint did not have any available drivers to deliver anything to me today. He spoke with somebody at the Lincoln depo and passed on details of all the contacts that I had spoken with. Lincoln depo told Matt that I was able to drive there and collect them myself but like me, Matt was not confident that the depot would be open, had I driven across to Lincolnshire. Matt had tried to speak with Anne himself but was told that she had gone home, nobody else at DPD was able to give consistent information to him.At 4:20PM CitySprint arrived with both of the parcels. Whilst this is the result that I wanted, arguing on the phone with 3 people at DPD, poor communication, poor customer service, and at least 2 and a half hours on the telephone, not to mention my anxiety levels that my son would not have his christmas present I can honestly say that this has been a very poor start to Christmas, and I would strongly recommend that businesses use alternative courier services as they cannot be relied upon and in turn reflects badly upon ther own business practice."
"mber 24, 2016",1,ASOS = SCAM,"I put two orders from ASOS on the same day, a dress and a pair of high heels.  What are the odds that they both came wrong.  They sent me an non-matching pair of shoes (two very different shoes in one box!) and a dress that has been obviously used before!!  The dress came with a strong smell of perfume and deodorant/sweat, wrinkles that form in the waist after you have been wearing something for a while and the lining had all the seams in the waist stretched.    Costumer service runs on a script as it's managed online.  They offered me a 10% discount which is obviously not at par with the conditions of the dress I received and their non-existant quality control mistake, and even more, based on the price of this dress ($178).I will be returning the shoes and the dress and hope they don't resell them and try to scam someone else.  Avoid the hassle!!!!"
"mber 23, 2016",1,Crooks!!!,This company took my money and NEVER sent anything. I get daily emails stating that the orders are on their way and this is the tracking information but it NEVER has any tracking information. After a few weeks I requested a refund and was advised I could not receive a refund until I returned the items. I HAVE NO ITEMS TO RETURN!!! THIS COMPANY RUINED MY CHRISTMAS. NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THEM!!! THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL AT RIPPING HARD WORKING PEOPLE OFF!!!
"mber 22, 2016",5,AMAZING SERVICE AND QUALITY,I honest to god have never been more relieved in my life than when I received my ASOS package. I don't know who is writing bad reviews but it sounds to me like competition sites may be writing dishonest reviews about asos. I live in the United States and my order got here no lie within 3 days. The quality of the clothes is absolutely gorgeous- comparable to lucky brand. SUCH A HAPPY CUSTOMER I will always love ASOS and continue to shop with them!!
"mber 22, 2016",1,Lost Christmas present,Ordered a huf x thrasher hoodie as a Christmas present. The purchase was made back in November and still has not been received. Very poor service considering it cost £80!!
"mber 22, 2016",1,Omg unbelievable,"I just have this word unbelievable in my mind, second time that they don't deliver on time, first was my sister's birthday presente and now four of my Christmas gifts, I bought it on December 8th knowing that they take a little longer than other companies to deliver but today is december 22th, I have been trying to conctat them for 8 days since I didn't get my stuff, they don't get back with a answer, this is a nightmare! If you want to have a really bad experience, buy from them! I order some stuff from Macys three days ago and I already have it! They are disrespecting me by not getting back ever! I feel so bad!"
"mber 22, 2016",1,"Waste of time, and money","Purchased two pairs of shorts from this company for a short notice holiday,  to be safe I ordered a 32 "" waist and a 34"" waist. When I eventually received these shorts one pair were way too small and the others way to large. Total Waste of time.  I wanted to contact  asos and give them my complaint I spoke to someone through live chat because there website gives no complaint address. After asking for a complaint email address for 15 mins I just to got  a response of just return them... Will not be using these cowboys again."
"mber 22, 2016",1,Dishonest company!,"This company ripped me off! I bought  a pair of boots for about £220 which arrived damaged. They had to be returned and I was refunded and given a voucher off my next purchase! I then purchased again using the voucher but was charged delivery which was supposed to be free as I was spending over £100. I called customer service and the adviser agreed I should be refunded the delivery cost, but I was told the manager would not allow this too happen. So my voucher ended up covering my delivery cost which was supposed to be free. I was clearly ripped off and this company is not too be trusted!"
"mber 21, 2016",1,I didn't received my refund. Disappointed and angry,"I returned a few items from my order, but then I got refunded for the wrong (cheaper) items. So I receives 8 euro's less than I should receive. I have e-mailed the costemar service about 10 times, but they kept telling me that they were sorry they made a mistake but the couldn't give rest of my refund back. They weren't willing to find a other solution or a discount code as an apologise. Nothing. I still didn't receive anything, still very angry."
"mber 21, 2016",1,Disappointing,"I ordered from asos a ""pink oversized puma sweater"" and a ""corset belt"" and it said the delivery date was the 24th of November and it is now December 21st. I called the post office because it said the package was coming from the U.K. When I called and gave them the tracking number they said that the tracking number seems to not exist and the package was lost now there is an open investigation with the package. I tried emailing them no email back, I contacted them on fb they responded but then after I responded no response today I am going to try to call them. Very disappointed and irritated because I spent $90 on this package."
"mber 21, 2016",1,"PATHETIC SERVICE , CUSTOMER SERVICE IS PAIN","Instead of human beings , they have robots as customer care agents who have mugged up lines like'WE WILL REVERT IN 48 HRS , WILL EMAIL YOU , NO MANAGER ON FLOOR 'Irrespective of mode, be it - call , Facebook , twitter - same reply.and best part is NO BODY CALLS OR EMAILS.I have been ordering stuff from them for almost 2 years now. but from past 5-6 months , there service is nothing but UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT. Trust me , I am not one of those who easily log on to computer and write bad review .I always give benefit of doubt and moreover can't take off time to curse a company..lol..But they actually tested my patience with there service. Till date I am waiting for my parcel to be delivered and it is 7 days past delivery date already."
"mber 20, 2016",2,Terrible.,"I made an order and was very happy with the speed of delivery because it came as soon as it said it would. Although I opened the package to find a broken item (money box) which was wrapped in bubble wrap, I didn't open it further as I didn't want to cut myself. I got onto ASOS straight away and submitted a complaint about my item. I received a confirmation email explaining that they will contact me asap, although a week passed and I heard nothing. I emailed them again and they emailed back the day after saying that nothing could be done except a refund because the item sold out, and they had yet another unhappy customer pushed aside.No promotional codes or anything were given (usually retailers would do anything they can to resolve the situation and if they cannot, a promotional discount is given for the future).Never again, DO NOT SHOP HERE!!"
"mber 19, 2016",1,Unbelievable and unacceptable,"Made an order which didn't arrive on time, therefore I cancelled the order. About 3 weeks after the order arrived so I sent it right away back to ASOS. Have been waiting for over 2 months for a refund. It's like they are just messing up with me, keep asking for my details over n over again but nothing gets sorted. I started accepting I won't get my money back... So I have basically lost lots of time and money! fck asos!!"
"mber 19, 2016",1,Incorrect Item,"I ordered flat pink sandals in UK size 8, what I got was orange heels in UK size 7.Delivery time was quick, but since I needed the sandals for a trip that week, the whole order was a total waste of time as I did not have the time to wait for return/exchange to take place.Everything was wrong about the item - the style, the color, even the size!!!If you need your items quickly, I do not suggest this place as you can never know what you will receive!"
"mber 19, 2016",1,Their Mistake - My Loss,"Did the usual, placed an order for it to not arrived when planned. Instead, recieve a notification from HERMES that is it being returned due to Incorrect address. It had not come to my Default listed address (no clue why they even have this if its ignored) but instead it had gone to an address I have not lived at for 2-3 years! Rang the help service, told that it would not be possible for them to reschedule the delivery or even supply me the parcel at all. That the order was now going to be returned back to sender (ASOS) via email notification to HERMES which takes 24-48 hours and then if i do want the parcel i will have to reorder. Explained that the Item is out of stock and that i will not be able to place the order, and they should just replace the order with my permission and CORRECT address.... But that isnt possible either, nothing but empty apologies given. Requested to speak to Manager or supervisor but told there is a 24 hour waiting list. Rang Headoffice directly, told again there is a 24 hour waiting but before i gave my details they hung up.NOT the first time i have been let down by this incompentant company which seems to only aim at displeasing its customers. If you are only a online shopping site, at least aim to do it correctly."
"mber 19, 2016",1,Most disgusting Customer Service ever rec'd by any company,"If I could rate at minus stars I would.Please, please, please avoid using this shambles of a company!!!!I was supposed to receive my order last week, it said it had been delivered and signed for by me, however I was at work so not possible.I try to get in touch with call centre but to no avail, I then speak to the chat service to be adv I would receive a copy of the signature to see if I recognise the hand writing!??.  after 4 attempts I finally get the signature which I didnt recognise so contact again and given no help whatsoever apart from would be raised as a dpd notification.I then called and asked to speak to a Manager and get told it would be 24hrs as there wasn't a manager in that night?? Really what sort of business doesn't have manager cover??........Guess what, unsurprisingly didnt receive it.  so I call again and get told it should have been adv 48 hrs so I wait another 24hrs........Guess what, unsurprisingly didnt receive it. So I called again and was advised it would be another 48hrs........Guess what, unsurprisingly didnt receive it.I then receive an email from dpd advising that the courier has delivered to another address so I called ASOS head office and was advised that dpd will collect the item from the other address and once scanned I would receive my refund back but could take a week.My point to ASOS is that my parcel has not been rec'd so why should I wait futher,  surely sort out the issue with dpd and in the meantime refund my money!!..........Guess what......they cant do that depsite it not being my issue! So I ask to speak to a Manager whilst also requesting where my original manager call is.  I then get advised that a Manager hadnt called me 2 days ago but a manager (Daisy) had entered my account to send an internal email somewhere to obtain further information but had decided not to courtesy call me to let me know this...... And then I get delibrately cut off.   Here I am 5 days later no parcel, no refund, no manager call and none the wiser what is actually happening and if I ever will get my refund which had frauduantly been signed for I suspect by the courier.....As I said.......Be warned avoid this shambles of a company at all costs."
"mber 19, 2016",5,In my good books,"So far, and i have been shopping with Asos for good few years, they failed me only once and it wasn't even really their fault. The website is good to navigate (like the recent filtering additions), delivery is quick, they offer student discount rarely seen these days, products are generally good quality and free, hassle free refunds are a joy! (considering you can't just try the clothes before you buy them).Overall great job!"
"mber 19, 2016",1,Fck ASOS Customer Service.,"I never spoke to anyone over the phone, only through live chats and emails. Terrible and rude is the best way to describe them. Always saying they'll look into the issue and email you within 48 hrs just for the same automated answer as the last 4-5 asos rep sent. Fck you ASOS."
"mber 19, 2016",5,Excellent,Quick and effective. I can recommend it.
"mber 19, 2016",1,No Refund after cancelation of my order,"When I Paid online my order, the order was cancelled. But payment was fulfilled.after 60 days i still don't have my money back.The helpdesk is terrible. They are friendly, but they won't help you. Or take you seriously. They asked for my complete bank statement of two months. Is send it over. But still the don't wat to help. You get every time the exact same standard e-mail.I will never order with them again.When something goes wrong, you lost all your money."
"mber 19, 2016",1,BEWARE! BEWARE! - GIFT CARDS,"I need to pass on my experience when I ordered a gift voucher - which is sent as an email with code .  I accidentally left out an underscored from the email address the voucher was to be sent to. I contacted them the next day (by live chat)  and explained and was told it would be sorted. After a week I re contacted them - had to go the same info and was told it would be sorted.  Still nothing! I tried to reach out to the email address I had wrongly entered and it would not accept an email - making me believe the voucher was never delivered.   Long story short - I finally received my refund after 9 weeks and many, many, forms of contact - email, live chat and customer service - which I was charged a rate per minute.  So please be aware."
"mber 18, 2016",5,Fantastic company,"I have shopped with asos for years and ive never had a problem thats not to say others havent. The choice of clothes, sizes, range and price is amazing. I find their deliver very quick and it has free returns."
"mber 18, 2016",1,Horrible,"I ordered a watch on December 1 thinking it would be here in time for Christmas well here it is December 18 and still no watch. I have been tracking my package and for over two weeks it has said shipping. I decide to talk to someone over live chat and she was no help and ended the chat before I was done talking to her. She was not helpful at all. I understand it is a busy and stressful time but if you can not get orders done and ready in a month then there is something wrong. My order is not big at all just one watch my boyfriend asked me to get him, but you better believe I'm not ordering off this website anymore!!"
"mber 17, 2016",5,I love love ASOS!,"I've always had great shopping experiences with asos. I have bought all sort of things from them like clothes, shoes, bags and accessories. Fast shipping and returns."

"mber 17, 2016",1,Poor customer service - then ignores your complaint,"I purchased the ASOS Premier Delivery subscription which allows customers to have free next day delivery. When my item took 3 days to arrive, I sent an email showing my dissatisfaction that I was not receiving the service I paid for. ASOS then tried to fob me off with a 10% off code (I already receive 10% with my NUS card) which can only be used on full priced items. I then replied stating I already receive 10% off and that the code isn't of any benefit (I haven't heard back since). I won't be using ASOS again as I have lost complete trust whilst showing they don't care about their customers."
"mber 16, 2016",2,Sadly disappointed :(:(,"I use ASOS all of the time and usually I cannot fault their service! The quality & price is fantastic and their delivery service is amazing!HOWEVER I ordered a bag from them and the clasp broke within 1 week so I messaged them on Facebook. I had already sent my returns back for the order and so wondered what could be done. I got a response the next day asking for my name, DOB & email address. I replied straight away & have heard nothing since! This was last Wednesday and still nothing!Please can you help as I have a faulty product!"
"mber 16, 2016",4,No worries!!,I got my package 5 days before the date stated which was an awesome surprise! Tracking my order was so easy. All items are true to the picture. Plastic hanger that came with my item is broken which is a shame but all else I'm satisfied!
"mber 15, 2016",3,Problems with returns,I love the stuff but the returnpolicy went wrong
"mber 15, 2016",1,This company is a joke,"Place a order 26th November, received a email from asos saying the items would be 24 hours late on 6th December then on the 9th asos refunded me my money back with a email saying for items have been returned and your payment is back in more account! Well that's poor business. I've shopped with this company for 10 years but twice this year I've had shocking service from them, I will not buy anything from this company ever again!"
"mber 15, 2016",1,Worst customer service ever!,"As other people have written before me. I gave my order the 28th of November and was guaranteed a 4 day shipping. After a week I got an email that my order would arrive in more than one parcel. After my order didn't arrive for another few days I contacted the customer service. The answer was yes the plane was delayed your package should arrive within the next 48 hours. Of course it didn't, and I contacted again the customer service of asos. So now, my shipping is supposed to arrive the 19th of December. However, since I'm traveling I won't be back within the time frame of 28 days to return my shipping. The support chat ""felt bad about that but couldn't change anything"". Thank you asos for not delivering my package within 3 weeks and additionally now forcing me to keep all the articles. I have never been taken less seriously in my complaints and not offered any help with my requests. Never again!!!"
"mber 15, 2016",1,Crap,"Sent me the wrong item, sent it back asking for the right one, refunded instead dispite it still being available to order on the website. Customer Care take 4-5 days to respond."
"mber 15, 2016",1,Too little too late,"I placed  an order on 11/29/16 and was given a delivery  date of 12/12/16. The  items they i oreded didn't show , so I used the chat feature on the site to inquire  about my package. I was informed that there had been an error with my package and that I would receive  an email within 48 hrs with an update on my order. I never received  an email and my package just showed up on my step today .The items that I ordered are of very poor quality and was totally not worth the wait."
"mber 15, 2016",1,Absolutely rubbish,Ive purchased  products from this site it is rubish quality and doesnt even look the same on as it would on the pictures on site considering its so expensive having to pay for returns and postage without receiving it back. Very disappointed  considering i spent 50 pounds on two flimsy items that arent appealing at all. Complete waste of time!!!
"mber 15, 2016",1,Delivery,"Ordered my item on November 28 and was said will be deliver in 4 days. I emailed them to see where my package is at and they say it should be delivered by the December  15, and now it is saying December 19th! Like if i knew that i was not going to get the package on the date before i leave i wouldn't even order feom here! My first and last time! Can i give them no star?"
"mber 15, 2016",1,Horrible Delivery,"I have placed two orders with asos. One November 29 and another dec 2. I was supposed to get them two weeks ago and have no idea where my packages are. I contacted asos, trakmypak and jerseypost and nobody responds. Asos had specific order times for Christmas so customers can get products by then and none of it is true! They shouldn't ruin people's Christmas and give people a date when they can't follow through it will arrive by then. One more week till Christmas and I'm hoping it will arrive sometime next week. Fingers crossed. If I do order from asos again I will use express shipping because standard is a joke. I will be extremely upset if I don't receive my products by Christmas and will contact my credit card company."
"mber 15, 2016",1,Customer service,Shocking  customer service  ..never reply to emails ..calls are charged at 13p per minute  plus network  charge and no one answer the calls ..I would never recommend  Asos  to  anyone
"mber 15, 2016",3,Asos is not the problem.... HERMES is!!!!,"Order some items from Asos a few weeks ago for an outfit for my Christmas party! Got an email on the Saturday from hermes to state my item will be delivered today, so I put a note on my post box to re deliver on the Sunday, was left a (sorry I missed you) card with ""I don't work Sundays"" on it! So Monday came around and I was at work and so was my partner, when I got an email stating my parcel had successfully been delivered!? When I arrived home I had assumed it had either been stuffed in my letter box or left with a neighbour!? It was neither of these things the parcel was simply not there! I reviewed the email again for any clues but noticed it said it had been signed for by me?!!!!!!!! I HAD NOT signed for this, so I did a live web chat which came back with nothing! I asked who had signed for my package and they couldn't tell me because apparently that can't see who signed for it!!!! I bit the bullet and decided to pay 13ppm and call Asos on 08701752638 spoke to a nice man on the phone and explained the situation! He was very apologetic and couldn't have helped me more! Because the item I required was for that evening there was no point me asking for them to send it again so I asked for a refund! He said they will be getting back to me within 48 hours with what will happen next! (I am still waiting as not 48 hours yet) He also described the signature to me which look like some letters and numbers? My signature doesn't have numbers!! This is crazy to me that a delivery driver would just sign it off as delivered and make me lose the money I've paid for their own benefit! The thing I will say is that I shall not be using Asos for anything else until the decide to change delivery companies! It tells you something when the man in the customer services says this is a very big problem for them! Change to dpd they are amazing!"
"mber 15, 2016",5,All great,I have never experienced any issues shopping at ASOS - they have great products with good prices and the shipping arrangement is so great too. I'll definitely shop here again and again and again!!
"mber 15, 2016",5,Excellent!,"So far I've only received top service from ASOS. I paid £9.95 for premier deliver and it was worth every penny! All my items have been delivered next day by DPD who give you an hour slot and they've never been late. The premier service also includes returns labels, I sent a return through Royal Mail on Monday and I've received an email 3 days later to say the refund has been returned. So far I've not been able to fault the service or the quality of the goods."
"mber 14, 2016",1,Never again !!,Ordered my package on the November 28th. It's now December 14th and my package hasn't moved in 2 weeks. Every time I email them or get in contact with them they tell me they will get back to me and when they do they just claim my package will be here in 48 hours and tell me my tracker (which is stuck in new york) will keep me updated. Package still isn't here. Leaving for a month in 2 days and I was hoping I'd have my package by then since it's the reason I bought it. Never ordering from here again
"mber 14, 2016",5,My favourite place to shop online!,"Asos has a huge selection and you can always seem to find exactly what your looking for! Products have always arrived on time or as soon as possible, great email responses! Includes many great features such as student discounts and free delivery if you spend over a certain amount. Would recommend and will definitely be using this site many times again in the near future!"
"mber 14, 2016",1,Sheer incompetence at its best,"I'm a nutshell, Hermes attempted the delivery of my parcel to my work address on a Sunday when no one was there. I expected it to be redelivered within next couple of days. Nothing arrived. I contacted ASOS via Messenger foolishly expecting a prompt reply. Nothing. I then emailed, had a reply two days later saying I would hear within 48 hours. Nothing. The response I eventually received via messenger was so patronising it was untrue. I replied but again no response. I resorted to phoning - after being on hold for over 15 minutes I got through to someone who offered me either a refund or replacement. I said surely it was easier to just their courier to redeliver. They said it was not. I asked for a replacement order & guess what?  The item now out of stock. I asked for a full refund and was promptly cut off. Absolutely dire service from ASOS. I expected better."
"mber 14, 2016",1,Absolutely useless 23754340,"Made an order on 25th November 2016 and was informed delivery would be by Friday 2nd December. Was taken in hospital on 30th November suddenly and released after an operation on 2nd December. Forgot about the parcel until the Sunday and looked at the tracking which said it had been delivered? I asked my neighbours who knew nothing so emailed Asos on 6th December but received no response. Emailed again on 10th December and received a reply saying it had been left in a safe place...... my green recycle bin!!! Actually my bins are emptied on a Wednesdays I am wondering who decided my recycle bin was a safe place! I again emailed asking for a refund but still waiting for a response so will have to contact my credit card company. I am seriously concerned about the quality of the service from Asos. I have not signed for this delivery and did not suggest a safe place.  The response I eventually received told me to look in bins and sheds etc, have done this but not allowed to lift more than a kettle for 6 weeks but Asos are so patronising they suggest the obvious ignoring the information the customer has provided. This is the first time I have shopped with them and it will be the last. Really don't know how they stay in business!"
"mber 14, 2016",1,"Useless customer service, waiting over four weeks for a Hermes collection - they've lost my business","I've spent well over £1000 with Asos in the last year, but recently had a couple of large orders where I needed to return items. I've had an operation so was unable to take the parcels, so was reliant on their Hermes pickup service. Over four weeks later and I am still waiting for them to collect. Pickups have requested by myself or Asos six or seven times, but each time the status just gets changed to delayed, or just stays open with no update. I managed to find a phone number for Asos Customer Care - not on their website, btw, I had to find it via Google (0207 756 1000 if you want to try) and have spent hours on the phone. On each occasion I have been told that they cannot contact Hermes but will email through another request. I don't understand how Asos can have a partner company such as Hermes but they have no way of contacting them. Utterly useless. I sent an official complaint via email over two weeks ago, but that has been completely ignored. I spoke to a guy on the phone last week and asked to speak to a manager. He said they have no managers there (?!) and he'd have to escalate it via email to one which would take 24 to 48 hours. Fine I said. A week later and still no call back. I then phoned again today and was told that because the items were delivered Asos had fulfilled their obligation, and because I want to return to Hermes I need to speak to them as I am now a Hermes customer. Yet Hermes say, both on their website and on their live chat fob off thing to contact Asos. It's bizarre. Asos use DPD for deliveries, who are fantastic, yet they use Hermes who are shockingly useless for their returns. Whilst they may be cheap, they still reflect on Asos, and Asos should think twice about who they partner with. As a long term customer of Asos I have had enough. I Should have been recovering from an operation, not getting stressed out about returning Asos parcels, and have had absolutely no support from Asos' staff, and have just been fobbed off. Their Facebook staff only seem to read the last message and just give me the same stupid reply, I've been repeatedly cut off when asked to speak to a manager or put through to someone in particular,and the fact that my official complaint has been completely ignored just tops it off. If anyone senior at Asos reads this, please contact me, as I can give you full details of the shocking support from your staff and names of people who need some serious training."
"mber 14, 2016",2,Terrible Customer Service - Poor!!,"I have been a huge fan of Asos for the past few years, annually signing up for the Premier Delivery service (which is worth the money - most of the time) however the past few months I have had nothing but issues with the company. The worst part of it, is that when you have a problem all you can do is Email or send them a message on Twitter, which then takes days to get a response!Most recent problem being that I order a size XL mens grey jacket and in response receive a medium grey jumper (that looks nothing similar to what I ordered) - Of course I contacted them by Twitter only to be told that it was a 'warehouse error' and that I needed to return the item. I did this reluctantly and requested a refund - to which I have not received yet after almost two weeks. Instead I chose to re-order the jacket myself in case it went out of stock, only to now have received the jacket again by ASOS after not even asking for it to be replaced!!This now means that I have TWO unnecessary trips to the post office through no fault of my own before I am able to get a refund, therefore my Premier Delivery is completely useless and unbeneficial, similarly to the customer service provided by Asos!!Its difficult because with the delivery service and vast range of products/brands, the website is a very convenient place to shop however lately the customer service and constant errors are making me re-think my choice to use them!"
"mber 14, 2016",1,Horrible service,"Absolutely terrible! Ordered Dec.1 having in mind that I would get my package in 5-8 days... WRONG! It is now Dec. 13 with my package somewhere in California. Support team is awful and it takes days to get in contact with someone. Buyer beware, these clowns don't know how to conduct business!"
"mber 14, 2016",1,NEVER ORDER FROM THIS SITE,CUSTOMER SERVICE MAKES ME SICK. TEHY DO NOT HAVE A PHONE NUMBER AND DO NOT RESPOND TO ANYTHING. PACKAGE IS 2 WEEKS LATE AND TRACKING IS AT A STANDSTILL. STAY AWAY!
"mber 13, 2016",1,As most of the reviews here: DO NOT USE,"order placed 2 weeks ago, have been told that will be delivered within 4 days - 2 weeks later - I didn't get my order, updates - nothing at all.  I phoned costumers service for 3 days in a row but the phone gets disconnected after half hour of ringing without anyone answering.I just want my money back now!!! DO NOT USE!!"
"mber 13, 2016",3,Puma Creepers by Rihanna,I want to buy some of Rihanna's Fenty creepers. Everywhere I look it's sold out. I wonder if it are the real ones on asos. Can somebody tell me if they are real or fake if you bought them at asos?
"mber 13, 2016",5,Great service,Free delivery and returns.  Quick delivery.
"mber 13, 2016",1,Worst shipping ever.....,"I ordered a jacket for my son on Black Friday - 2 day shipping - It's December 12th and the Jacket is in UK, I ordered from the U.S. Totally do not recommend. Worst online shopping experience ever."
"mber 13, 2016",1,Horrible service and don't know What they are doing,Right now I live abroad and work and I needed some new work shoes and thought it would be a good idea to order from Asos. Worst decision ever. The first problem was that I needed the shoes ASAP so I ordered it on express delivery but the time limit was not kept - might have taken 4-5 days more which was a shame since I was supposed to wear some of the clothing in that weekend. But they were actually kind enough to refund the extra I had payed for the express since it was not right. Then I opened the package (which I had payed 37 € to get from customs) and then it turns out that it is not my order. I had ordered a pair of shoes and some clothing but instead I got a completely different evening dress. I tell Asos this and instead of asking me how we could solve the problem they just tell me that they have resend my package but now it is only containing 2/5 of what I ordered. It will now contain some of the clothing that I was supposed to wear some weeks ago and not the shoes that I actually needed. I told them that I no longer needed the items but they said it was to late now since they had just decided to resend things I do not need. Now I have to pay customs again for something I do not need. I do not live near a post office and it is great trouble and expensive to return the things from the Caribbean to the UK.... But they didn't really seem to care about their screwup. I spend several hours trying to chat with them but was disconnected several times so I had to explain over and over again. I tried Facebook and email but they really don't seem to care. Worst service ever received. Will never buy from them again. Now I am sitting with different clothing items I do not need and without a way to get a refund for it even though it was all their fault.
"mber 13, 2016",1,Terrible Terrible service,"Ordered overalls on Asos and was supposed to get it in 4 days. instead, I'm anxiously waiting for my shipment 10 days later. The tracking number says that it is invalid and the customer service won't get back to me. Possibly a shame? Possibly a fraudulent company? Either way I hope no one shops here or else they will have to bear the burden of terrible customer service and a bag of lies! Still waiting to hear back from them - wish there was some sort of policing service to shut them down."
"mber 12, 2016",5,Excellent service- every time!,"Asos is a great place to shop, delivery is lightening speed & refunds are just as fast. I have shopped with this company for years and recommend them to everyone! Keep up the good work asos!"
"mber 12, 2016",1,Absolutely diabolical,Absolutely disgusting paid for twenty four hour delivery for my daughters prom dress the poor girl waited as instructed until ten o clock in the evening nothing.  Nil customer service from the company or the carrier Hermes the worst service ever now they have my money and no delivery no update no contact I have told them my daughter so let down I willPost reviews of their disgusting service everywhere there not bothered    Keep well away lots of good companies out there need our money not this shower
"mber 12, 2016",1,No item and can't contact the company??,"I made an order, a few Christmas presents, about a week ago. Asos hired Hermes to deliver it. Hermes, as everyone knows, are absolutely awful. living up to their reputation, they stopped tracking my order and I still haven't received it. Asos are not responding to any emails. If you write a comment on Facebook, they'll respond to a PM asking for your date of birth and order number. This does not lead onto anything, and is just there to make you think something will happen. So now I'm stuck with absolutely nothing that I can do. Do not shop with Asos at Christmas time. They want to maximise their profits and deliver next to no service."
"mber 11, 2016",1,Facebook messaged customer service is abysmal,"They were helpless , and didn't apologies once for their unsatisfactory service they took up to 24 hours to respond and would then only respond when I asked them to on their main page . They had taken my money via PayPal which was taken out of my bank account , when I went on to my Asia account there were no purchases in my history . Obviously I was scared about this and they didn't help at all . Also said I would get my money back until Christmas which is ridiculous and meant that I had to spend double the money on this dress - that in the time it had been attempting to sort out had gone out of stock in my size - deciding on another size I ordered it and it was then estimated to arrive the day after my event . To say I'm annoyed is an understatement."
"mber 10, 2016",1,Awful Customer service,"I had an issue with an order where they took my payment, then told me the items were dispatched, and then before they even arrived with me I had another email thanking me for the return, then they refunded my payment. I wanted the  item so I sent quite a few emails to chase them up and tried to call them as well which cut me off after waiting on hold for the customer service team for 15 minutes each time. Their deals are good, but their customer service is very very very poor indeed!"
"mber 10, 2016",5,PERFECT!,I recieved my order in 3 days to Denmark with the standard delivery. The product was in good quality and like the pictures. Thank you :)
"mber 10, 2016",1,Generate postage tracking but don't post AWFUL,"Hi Every time I place an order with asos they generate a tracking number which  says order placed on carriers webpage, but then remains that way.until you phone complain and get a refund .absolute shambles of a company Bored of ridiculous customer serviceYours,sincerely ex asos customer"
"mber 10, 2016",4,Good,It was good I don't know basically hahahahaha fukkk I hope it's not fake
"mber 10, 2016",1,"Poor customer care, rubbish delivery times, dont use!!",Very poor in every department.
"mber 10, 2016",3,Sometimes good sometimes less,"Sometimes deliveries are fast and perfect, sometimes late and missing"
"mber 10, 2016",4,Good customer service,I ordered a backpack in september and it tool longer to arrive. Customer service replied quickly and i got tracking code and finally got the bag
"mber 09, 2016",1,the shopping experience and customer services is the worst ever in my opinion.,DON'T BUY FROM THE WEBSITE
"mber 09, 2016",1,Terrible Service,Will not be ordering from this crappy site again. Terrible delays in delivery.
"mber 09, 2016",1,Item Never Delivered - Been Over a Week - No Reponse,"I have used ASOS for years and the last month they have just absolutely ruined it for me - I've had wrong items delivered, or items not deliveredLast week I ordered something on a Next Day - The tracking said I had signed for it and it was delivered.  This was far from true, I didn't even have a card left to say the courier had been.I tried to live chat ASOS after three failed attempts I got through to someone who said they couldn't help until it had been investigated with the courier she asked me to contact again in 48 hours so I did.  The girl I was speaking with on Live Chat responded once and left me waiting for 30 minutes!! So I cancelled it and now it's not letting me chat again, they won't respond to emails so I have absolutely no way of contacting them to get my money back or even have the product sent out to meThe courier will not help me and neither will the retailer, no product, no refund and not even a response to say they are looking into itI've spent loads with ASOS over the years - The customer service is absolutely poor and I think for such a large company they need to open a telephone customer service team"
"mber 09, 2016",1,SOB!!!!,Is all I can say about this company! I won't get into details because it's too much to write. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!! Is all you need to know. TRUST ME!!!!
"mber 08, 2016",1,no customer service,"My order is being shipped to an old address across the country that I have no way of retrieving because of a glitch in their website (they even said it was a glitch.) The same thing happened to my friend. I was told I may not be able to be refunded or change the address, even though I contacted them before it went out for shipment. They told me they only thing I could do was contact them again after it's been dispatched and they cant try to have it returned. I have emailed them 3 times, messaged them on facebook, and tweeted at them and they are completely unreachable. I was able to call UPS and they told me the information that ASOS gave me was wrong and they could have changed the address the whole time, but now since I can't get in contact with them I will have to wait for my tracking number and then pay a fee to redirect the package. ASOS has been my favorite store for years but this experience and complete lack of customer service has discouraged me from ever ordering with them again."
"mber 08, 2016",4,Best online shop,"Best online shopping site! Quick delivery, wonderfull clothes, great concept and clothing in every price range. The reason why it wasnt 5 stars is their slow costumer service - but you have to remember that they are very buisy."
"mber 08, 2016",1,Worst customer service ever,"I bought some Jeffrey West boots, they arrived damaged and unwearable. They had gone to a fat footed person who opted to send them back with no box. I was the lucky person to recieve them next. I explained that I would like them replaced but due to our fat footed friend, in a smaller size. They advised this was against policy and would not replace them. After talking for 1 hour, it was agreed they would replace as per my request. They picked up the boots yesterday via Hermes. Today I find that in the chat they refuse the agreed replacement. No manager to talk to. If you have no issues, then they work.. The communication breaks down when you need their help. I would avoid if you like me cannot see much sense in these false promises. Even when they logged it all down, and i have it in writing. Thanks ASOS. BTW...they tell you in the online chat and twitter that there is not telephone number to call. Google does indicate a number and i do get through to people who apparently work at ASOS."
"mber 08, 2016",1,got worse,"used to love the company but their customer service is so poor now, you cant speak to anyone now all you get is silly messages with smiley faces and the like. I wish they read your message rather than give you a stock answer, worse than no answer at all! wont be renewing my membership"
"mber 08, 2016",2,Bad Customer Service,"I previously loved ASOS and ordered from there constantly. But recently I have received incorrect items and most recently my order was lost and I had to speak to 4 different people to finally get my refund back. They say wait 48 hours for a response but then you never receive one, so you have to keep messaging them hoping someone will help!"
"mber 08, 2016",1,Awful company to deal with when things go wrong!!!,Ordered an item on the 17th november and was told i would receive it on or before 22nd november. Its now the 8th december and it's still not here. I have phoned asos several times and they keep telling me they will look into it and get back to me within 48 hours. I never hear back from anyone. I have phoned again today and again told it can take 48 hours to process. I wonder if i'll get anywhere this time......5th time lucky?
"mber 08, 2016",1,Bad customer service+ website isn't updated,"Ordered 2 items. one that i wanted the most, the other just for free shipment.few days after- I get an email that the main item is out of stock.so they add extra shipment fee + send the extra item to me in full price.after contacting customer service all i got is ""this is our policy, no returns and no cancellation"".They can't tell if they have item in stock or not, they know it only after you pay..Asos isn't worth your time... not professional and bad customer service."
"mber 08, 2016",4,Good but not great,"So many lovely products. Huge variety of items even for plus size girls.Costumer service on the chat is helpful. BUT - returning items are quite difficult.... Earlier on there was a return label in the parcel.Now you have to pay the return, send them a copy of the receed. Then wait weeks for the proceedings. Was better before."
"mber 07, 2016",1,poor website,Tried to make an order on the website.  It was slow and when I got to the checkout and pressed to checkout it just took me back to my order.  Going round in circles.  I gave up in the end.
"mber 07, 2016",1,Appalling service,Appalling customer service.
"mber 07, 2016",1,Appalling service,"Have been charged for 2 dresses, supposed to arrive 2 Dec. Tracking order says address issue ! ( Hermes)Called ASOS 3 X  waiting for 30 mins for expensive connection, said they will send a request To Hermes and email, 2 days later nothing, don't respond to email from web site and asked manager to call me - nothing Poor service asked for refund  can't do anything until I get parcel !!!!Tomorrow is my call to their HQ and then legal route what a joke"
"mber 07, 2016",1,"Don't shop with them, EVER go to NET a PORTER","Worst company on the planet.First order with them they sent me the wrong item with side pipping sticking out that was painful. returned it without any consideration of their mess up to let me want to come back.A year later, now, I try them out again on black Friday. I entered my new address saved it and made sure it was listed as I hit place order...it was. However my confirmation email stated the wrong address. Mind you I shopped for 1 hour or more....so I instantly go to someone on live chat to change the address...this is within 4 minutes of placing my order my only option was to cancel and re order everything. That's ridiculous so I asked to speak to a supervisor...they said there is no number for us to call into (big red flag there) and than he just left the chat with no resolution or confirming that at least my shipment will be expedited like I also asked.So I email in.... again no help no acknowledgement of wanting to talk to a manager and have my shipment expedited.Finally after 3 days of back and forth someone calls me with attitude and totally disregards all my requests...still. I finally have someone get my package for me from my old address and what do you know.... I get an item with a hole in it...Seriously just go to The OUTNET or NET A PORTER asos shouldn't be a company they suck."
"mber 07, 2016",1,Don't even deserve one star.,Don't even deserve one star. They ignored my cancellation and send me the items anyway! appalling customer service when i contacted them about this
"mber 07, 2016",5,Really good website,"Used ASOS for years, always incredibly impressed with the service, it's fast and reliable."
"mber 07, 2016",1,Sucks inaccurate shipping and deliver details,Horrible dispatch and tracking info. Late on delivery and bad tracking number that did not work.
"mber 06, 2016",1,woeful delivery and even worse customer service,"I ordered 5 items. Had a delivery notification from Hermes for 13.00 to 17.00. Stayed in, no delivery. Then a notification saying a failed drlivery 3 hrs later but there was no card left.Contacted chat and spent more ghan 20 mins to be told that it never was a delivery snd anyway my delivery date was a day later so it didn't matter. I queried why it didn't matter that I had wasted a day off for no reason. When i asked for a transcript of the conversation was told it would be emailed to me as I was logged in and they had my details. One hour later no email so I contacted chat again (same name, probably same person). She told me I needed a reference number from the last conversation. I was never offered one and ehen I queried why as they knew who I was and the time they must have a log of the communication. Was told their system wasn't working so they can't trace the conversation!Apparently it's okay to keep me in all day vecause the item wasn't meant to be delivered until the next day even though the courier sent a tracking link saying it would be delivered. Incidentally, Asos delivery time is 7 days and they consider that reasonable. Certainly will not be using them again."
"mber 06, 2016",2,Love products HATE customer care,"I have been ordering from asos for so long! And the experience has been good until now. My order had to ve delivered on 5th of december. Well it didn't and i contacted customer care via chat. It took them forever to get back at me, they have no idea where is my order or when it's gonna be delivered. They said they would get back at me in 1-2 days! This is outrageous! They didn't even apologize for the delay! Is it so hard to say sorry??? I am so infuriated right now!!!!"
"mber 06, 2016",4,Wish they had a number to call,Asos is a great company i like how easy it is to make returns or exchanges if needed. The only reason i gave them 4 stars is because they don't have a customer care phone number to call here in the U.S. but other than that my experience was good.
"mber 06, 2016",4,Great company,I've been dealing with Asos for 4 years now and they've rarely disappointed me so far. Sometimes there's an issue of quality especially with the Asos brand but it's what to be expected for such cheap prices. Shipments have always been on time and refunds very smooth.
"mber 06, 2016",1,rubbish customer care,Customer care never replies your email or sth.. It always takes them ages to get back to me. This time I ordered 12 items and I only received 6 of them. totally disappointed. Never come back again.
"mber 06, 2016",2,Poor quality,"For the price, you'd expect better prices. Two of the zippers of dresses I have purchased were broken before zipping them on me. I had to cut myself out of one dress because the zipper broke on me. Very disappointed"
"mber 05, 2016",1,Dont count on the delivery date.,"So I ordered these jeans off Asos. When the order was placed, it was originally estimated to be delivered on Dec 5. Even on the first email they sent. But then I tracked it said estimated to be delivered on Dec 8 on there shipping site. The day I reviewed this was Dec 5 and the package inst here like originally promised. It's already 11 pm the shipping company had already closed."
"mber 05, 2016",5,Very good,Used a number of times always had a good service from Asos. Quick delivery and good returns process although only had to return something once before.
"mber 05, 2016",1,Terrible customer service and mishandling of orders,"I have ordered several things from ASOS and this is the second time they mess up my order. I moved months ago and they sent my last order to my previous address even though my default address is my current address. When I received an email update from UPS with the destination, I contacted immediately. The first person ended my chat conversation abruptly after I told them that I was talking to them though my phone screen and couldn't change the browser to provide the order number. The second person also stopped responding after they told me that there was nothing they could do and I would only be refunded if the package is returned to them from the address they incorrectly sent it to. Since ASOS can't handle their mistakes, I contacted my credit card company and they disputed the charge. That's the last time I order anything on ASOS."
"mber 05, 2016",3,Good Service - Quality Low,I do like the range of products ASOS offer and their app makes it easier for me to shop BUT I'm constantly let down with the quality of the items I receive once I've ordered. Either the pictures are doctored to make the products look more appealing or i'm missing a trick but i'm consistently getting sub par items for lesser known or ASOS branded clothing. Other main stream brands are as you'd expect.
"mber 05, 2016",2,Ordering and Shipping are Always a Problem,"I really love the variety of choices and great deals available as well as the aesthetics of the website and the simplicity of the app. However, ordering and shipping is where the problem starts. My very first time ordering from Asos, it took forever for the order to process and ship and I still received the wrong item. By that time, the item that I wanted had sold out. Customer service was not very helpful. I recently ordered from Asos during their CyberMonday sale. One week later, and the order is still processing. I have already received all the items from the other online stores that I ordered from during CyberMonday. Ordering and Shipping has been a problem everytime I have tried to use this website. Its very frustrating."
"mber 05, 2016",5,Never any problems,Been using Asos for about 3+ years now and I have never had any problem at all with them! Great quality service
"mber 04, 2016",5,Brilliant company with lovely staff,"I've always shopped on ASOS, however the past year or so I have been blown away by how amazing they really are.Firstly, in 2015 my mother was diagnosed with Meningitis. This affected me a lot, so I started to fundraise for the charity Meningitis Now. I wrote to many companies, ASOS being one of them, asking for donations. ASOS sent me a lovely (huge) parcel with items they donated along with a lovely note. It's not normal that a company would trust a 17 year old girl at the time with that, but they were so wonderful and encouraging which was brilliant and helped with my fundraising massively. Also, in terms of customer service, they respond to problems really well. Recently, my Cyber Monday order failed to process and I didn't get notified until the next day, meaning the 20% off code was no longer valid. This meant if I ordered again I would have to pay full price. I e-mailed ASOS straight away and they responded immediately and were very polite, passing me onto the correct person. They kept me updated with the process of my issue and then gave me another 20% off code to use.I would highly reccomend ASOS and trust them 100% as a brand."
"mber 04, 2016",1,Awful customer service experiences,"I usually love asos, unfortunately customer service is awful and needs major work. i frequently experience, unfriendly, rude, professional and unhelpful staff who are meant to be helping me and reassuring me with things like missing parcels, order issues etc. I work in customer service industry and from my perspective it is terrible.... ASOS staff are not trained in basic skills and it's a massive turn off for customers.I won't be shopping with ASOS again as a result of a series of bad experiences with rude ASOS staff. FYI it really isn't hard to be friendly and at least pretend to enjoy your job. Shocking."
"mber 04, 2016",5,I love ASOS!,"I see a lot of negative reviews on here for things like customer service or deliveries but not a lot on the one thing that truly matters when people are looking for reviews, the products. I've ordered from ASOS a bunch of times and I've also returned items and never had an issue with either. The 3-5 day standard shipping is exactly what it says, 3-5 business days for them to SHIP the product but that doesn't mean you will receive it in 3-5 days. I live in the US and it usually takes about a week for my to receive my orders. I've never had to deal with their customer service so I can't speak on that. The quality of the products I've gotten is really good but I'm sure it varies depending on what you get since they carry different brands. Don't believe the negative reviews this is a legit site with lots of cute options. A friend recommended asos to me a few years ago and I've been shopping here ever since."
"mber 04, 2016",2,Awful customer service,"Reasonably priced clothes and good delivery service but major issues when you need to return, exchange or have to speak to customer service. Budget fashion = budget service."
"mber 03, 2016",1,WAIT! DO NOT ORDER.,"As a regular customer, I was astounded by their digraceful service in my most recent order. As my ASOS premier delivery had expired, I opted for the standard delivery which takes between 3-5 days at maximum however after 3 days my order had yet to be dispatched and was stated as ""Processing"" in the order status. I believed this to be a system error and continue to hope that the item was on it's way and would arrive latest within the 5 day period as promised. This was not the case, since after 7 days, I was notified that my item was finally dispatched, this was utterly disappointing since there was no message on the website to state that the item would take a week to dispatch. I believe the company clearly did not have the item in stock yet continued to present this item as available to customers. Furthermore, what really frustrates me, is that I was not sent an e-mail at any stage within the 7 days to apologise for this delay. They simply believe it is acceptable to leave their customers bewildered. I am now in a state of disappointment and sharing my experience on multiple review website, so that others are aware of there service, and what they are likely to encounter, when purchasing from ASOS especially with Christmas upcoming."
"mber 03, 2016",1,Worst customer service,"I ordered an item on next day delivery. The item got lost. When I contacted ASOS they advised I would wait another 48 hours before they could advise where my product is. Who knows how long I would have to wait to actually receive the product after the 48 hours! I suggested they send me oit another product and take up the issue of the missing item with the their delivery supplier- but no, ASOS couldn't possibly do that. They would rather penalise the customer for the inefficiencies in their service. At no point was I offered any sort of compensation - not even for paying extra for next day delivery. Also, could only chat to somebody online - no actual phone number. Online chat is basically like chatting to a computer or robot - no concept of customer service at all and certainly not willing to try to keep the customer happy even though the error was completely on their side."
"mber 03, 2016",1,High hopes on parcel being delivered,FCuking asos wasted my Fcuking time
"mber 02, 2016",2,Good products but terrible service,"Actually shopping on ASOS is brilliant- there are lots of products and they are good value. Problem is the TERRIBLE service. I have received several damaged items due to them being packed in a thin plastic bag with no protection- this included a £80 bracelet that I was told would only be replaced if they deemed it a manufacturing error, which meant I could have sent it off and them tell me ""no you did it so we will not refund."" Their customer service is constantly slow and ask irrelevant questions (why do you need my date of birth???) and they do not even read what you have written half the time. I have also had to return TWO faulty items in the last few months, one of which was lost in the post for 2 weeks before they would look at it. Sort out your packing/shipping/quality control departments! They are really letting you down!"
"mber 02, 2016",1,So angry!!!,Ive always ordered with asos and everything went well. Now the last 4 times everything went wrong! Now i ordered and paid extra for it to came thursday and now it says it will be there monday! I try to get in touch with them but its impossible im so angry and i want the money back that i paid extra. How can i get in touch with you guys ????? So dissapointed
"mber 02, 2016",1,Parcel never arrived,"I ordered a top for my son and was informed by Hermes that it would be delivered to my home address last Friday ( a week ago today) The parcel never arrived but according to Hermes the parcel was signed for by customer (who was me but I wasn't even home but my husband was) and no parcel arrived. I contacted ASOS on Sunday when I returned home after a weekend away and I was informed that it would take 48 hours for Hermes to do signature check. 48 hours passed and I heard nothing so I recontacted ASOS and was told it could take up to 5 days. ...........I have still heard nothing. ASOS messenger just asks me the same questions, tells me to check with neighbours, look behind bins etc, which is totally frustrating as I have done all that (and its not my job to go to neighbours houses when Hermes says I signed for it). I have since been in touch with Paypal and I am hoping that they can resolve my problem. I will not shop with ASOS again, they have left me feeling like a cheat and a thief. I am now poorer for the experience and have to find the money to buy my sons Christmas present. If I could give them - stars I would !!!"
"mber 02, 2016",4,"Both good and bad, but overall good!","I agree with people who might say that their service ain't the best. I think their chat-function on their website is truly worthless. However when I've spoken with their support on Facebook they've been quite great. Since they switch people who answer it might be difficult for them to keep up what the topic is about, but they still keep the good service and they are polite and helpful. They helped me when I wanted to send back a pair of jeans which were faulty. I didn't have the bag I got the jeans in nor the paper for return, but helped me well. The shipping might be +1 day other than said but otherwise really good. Unfortunately some things (don't know why) can't be shipped to my country (Sweden) such as NYX Setting Spray, which is unfortunate, and they don't say until I try to check out."
"mber 02, 2016",3,Petite Items,"The items I ordered arrived as promised (4day shipping)  which was impressive considering this was holiday week and I live in Seattle, WA. A little disappointed with the sizing of the item I ordered.  I'm 5 1"", athletic/  curvy build. I was excited that the petite shop had such variety to offer.  I ordered a high neck,  velvet bodycon dress,  it looked as promised,  but when I tried it on it was a good 5 inches too long!  And it didn't do my curves any favors,  either.  Surprising,  since I ordered the smallest size available: 2.  Kind of just straight up and down. Not sure if I'll keep out to have it altered length-  wise, as I really do need it for an event. Wanted to avoid all that bother by ordering petite to begin with!!  Shoes could have been packed better,  too,  box wasn't dented but shoes (velvet block heels)  arrived needing to be bent back into shape."
"mber 02, 2016",1,Took too long to ship,Take more than a week to only prepared for shipment after purchasing and also some technical problems going on low stock product got notification for one of my order out of stock when they just created the label which is 9 days later.:(
"mber 01, 2016",1,Disgusted with level of service,Ordered something for my daughter for Xmas.  Reduced over black Friday weekend. Money taken from account but no confirmation email or trace of order. Tried to contact customer services via FB..no answer. Got through to the online chat room.  They could find no evidence of my order and laid the blame for the missing money at the door of my bank!!!!got to wait for 10 days to see if it gets paid back in! ...oh and no longer able to order goodsome at the sale price.  Moral of the story? Shop elsewhere...cheeky f###ers
"mber 01, 2016",1,Very poor service after a several mistakes from their end,"Hello Asos, In my life I have never publicly posted complaints about anything, anyone or anywhere. But as I'm feeling pretty desperate right now about the poor service Asos has provided me within the last few days, I've decided to do so. For my birthday coming up next week, my boyfriend let me pick out a jacket on asos.com. I had my eye on a suede biker jacket for a while, and was so happy when Asos announced the Black Friday 20% Discount weekender. On Thursday the 24th of Nov. I placed the order using the Black Friday promocode. Happy as kid!On Tuesday the package arrived. It turned out to be the wrong jacket. Instead of the 207 (incl discount) biker jacket, it was a 50 euro New Look jacket. Nice, but not my thing. I went online as fast as I could and turned to the chat for help. Chat was busy. I tried PM on Facebook. After a few questions asked on the other end and I replied, nobody answered. I turned to the chat again. This time somebody was there. The guy told me to sent pictures of the wrongfully delivered item as proof, so I did. He said I have to sent back the jacket as fast as I can, and that he wasn't able to sent me the right item until the wrong jacket was back with Asos. I live in the Netherlands, so I knew that it would take days. I noticed my biker jacket was low in stock. But what if it's sold out bij then? He said, no worries, I'll make sure the jacket will be well on it's way. I'll pre pack it for you. Ok, I'm reassured now. I drop everything I'm doing and deliver the jacket to PostNL. The next morning (!!) the person that ignored me all day on Facebook decided to reply. ""Can you please sent me pictures of the PostNL receipt as proof? Then I'll make the order ready for you"". So I did, I sent pictures of the receipt. Then the following evening (!!) the Facebook person replies. ""Sorry the item you requested is out of stock. Remember it's your responsibility that the wrongfully delivered item get's back to us in time. Only then can we refund the 207 euro's"". So your mistake is now my responsibility??It's not until now that I'm starting to get mad. I go home, and start another chat. With Conner this time. After a 65 min chat, he apologizes on behalf of his colleague. ""Pre packaging an item is not possible he says. You've been mislead by my colleague, I'm terribly sorry"". He promises to speed up the process of getting back the 207,- back to me. Since next week is my birthday and I now have no present and no refund back in time. It's going to take 5 to 10 working days he says. Still to late I say. He then gives me 20% discount promocode for my next order to compensate. I accept, thank politely and close the chat. Next morning, still so disappointed about that jacket I so desperately want. I go online, and to my surprise. Jacket is back in stock! I decide to take my chances and order the jacket again, using the 20% discount promocode dear Conner of customer care gave me. The promocode works. I go to check out. I try to pay. Oops, not enough money on my account. In my rush to score this jacket I forgot to put the cash from my savings to my paying account. I cancel the order and start over again. This time with enough balance on my account. So I go to check out. Insert the promocode again. It works. I pay. And all is good. Another 207,- euro's lighter, but at least I'm happy again. A few moments later I receive 2 emails. The first one says: The promocode you're using is invalid. Order cancelled. Second email says: Problem with bank. Order cancelled. I now check my bankaccount and see that 207 euro's in fact have been written of my account. With a big sigh I turn to that dreadful chat again. I explain the whole situation. That I have now paid 414 euro's for a jacket that I don't have. The girl on the chat is saying they have received no money from me and that the bank probably has it on hold. I ask the girl to hang on as I call the bank. Bank says, ""No the money has been wired to Asos. We're not holding it"". So I sent the girl a print screen of my bankaccount, with the full details of the transaction. Proving that I paid the damn jacket after all. She refuses to help me any further and offers me a discount of 10% the next time I order. She keeps on saying that another team needs to look into this. She even ends the chat while I'm still asking things. Now Asos, I need to know where that 414,- euro's went and if I'm ever going to get it back. And why are you doing so little to correct the mistakes that started with the wrongly delivered item, misleading a customer and now not looking into that strangely cancelled order. I have done everything you've asked me to do. So now it's time to correctly handle this complaint and show that you are a professional, adequate webshop that cares about their customers."
"mber 01, 2016",5,Always reliable - awesome clothes!,I have ordered there over 10 times. I have never had any problems. The products always arrive on time and my returns have always been refunded. A lot of people are complaining about postage but.. thats not Asos fault? That your postage system that sucks haha
"mber 01, 2016",5,Best online store!,"I have been shopping online at asos for a few years now and I couldn't say one bad word about the company. I can rely on them for orders to be delivered on time and customer service is very helpful for any problems. Now they have included plus size clothing, I feel much better in myself for being able to wear more fashionable clothes that are available in my size, that isn't available elsewhere. I always get compliments on any item I wear from asos!"
"November 30, 2016",4,One very helpful person made up for a fashion fiasco!,"i ordered a black full length dress on Tuesday evening for a black tie charity dinner on thursday night. i paid for next day delivery and received it very happy at 2pm the next day! however once trying it on i noticed there was a tear in the material on the side! not ideal for an event the next day!! so i hoped online to chat to one of the staff. Micheal took my order number then for a further 10 minutes didn't reply to me. he then proceeded to tell me my order didn't exist and then ended the conversation. as you can imagine i'm getting very stressed because at this stage ill be going stark naked to an event, i thought id try my luck again an hour later.. this time i spoke to Georgina! i explained my situation and then forwarded a photo of my previous conversation with the infamous Micheal. honestly Georgina could not have been more helpful she ordered my new dress straight away so it would be here (hopefully) in time for my event tomorrow night. whilst i wasnt that annoyed about the dress micheals attitude made it a whole lot worse- more people like georgina who were friendly, helpful and polite would be ideal! GEORGINA YOU ARE A STAR"
"November 30, 2016",5,Wish I had found this company sooner!,"I don't know about their other products, but I purchased bomber jackets and I love them! They look really nice and aren't expensive, I only payed $12 for 2 day shipping and I think that's awesome! Companies like Hollister would charge a little more for standard shipping. I'm definitely gonna buy a lot more jackets here now!"
"November 29, 2016",4,Great website.,"I just don't understand all those negative reviews. If you are not satisfied : Call or send an email to Asos Service! I am 100% satisfied by Asos' services & items. I have been ordering on their website for 5 years now. And I have never had an order lost or a long shipping. (It only lasts one week & I live in Belgium btw)   Or an item with deffect. I saw all the changement of this website : it gets better year by year. This year (for the first time) they forgot to put one little bandana choker in my order, I told them directly & they sent me my necklace. They resolved my problem quickly with a lot of kindness. And when I decide to return an item, I receive my money in 9 or 10 days only ! They always sell trendy clothes from their own brand (which is great quality) & from other brands. I love that now the return is free for Belgium. The last thing that they should improve : let people review & note items. They will certainly have less return if customers can help each other to buy an item. This is why I put 4 stars because I think that it's very important.  That's all. :) And I don't know why,  I'm skeptical by all those negative comments. Be careful, the concurrence is also here to destroy their image."
"November 28, 2016",2,CANADIAN customers - don't trust the promised on the website,I ordered a dress for a special occasion - I paid an additional $15 for express shipping with the understanding that there would not be any shipping or duty charges - based on what the website said.I received my order - on time - but was charged $35 COD for duty.  The dress didn't fit - again can't trust the website for sizing - now I have to pay $30 to ship the dress back.I've literally paid for the dress - twice - and can't wear it.  I won't order from them again.
"November 28, 2016",5,Love this site!,I love ASOS always quick shipping plus student discounts are the best! Customer service is also very helpful!
"November 28, 2016",5,Great online shop,"Asos always has a great selection of clothes for all body types, prices are reasonable and they often have sales or offers. The best thing is they have a simple returns policy (and free) which takes away the worry if you are unsure about sizing. Always promptly refunded too."
"November 28, 2016",1,Won't replace faulty item,"Be very careful, I ordered 4 vests for ASOS, 3 were fine and one had a 4 inch gap down one seam where it had clearly missed the sowing machine during manufacturing. Contacted customer services, a few days later got an email asking for photos which I sent. Got another email saying they can't ope the images  (they were jpg the most widely used and readable images which means they could open them). I resent them and have had no response. A completely useless company who try to find any reason not to replace / refund items supplied not fit for purpose. Thankfully I pad with PayPal and will now contact them to get my money back. ASOS fine unless they send you faulty goods because you'll be stuck with them."
"November 28, 2016",1,"Customer service like the items, neither available!","Ordered some items. Delivery date came and went, no warning or apology it would be late. Email sent, no reply to ask when it may arrive....Follow up with online chat, agent left chat without answering the questions, as probably knew nothing would be happening and may be wanted to get her nails done or something productive! Follow up online chat, gave a ""way"" to complain, no reply! Follow up online chat, helpful agent realized after more than a month, we are not getting our product, even though asked me to check behind the bins one more time... But, at least they sent the refund...Refund arrives, not the right amount, back to online chat, another useless member of staff who cannot handle the simple request and then finished the chat, although they cleverly added some text to say if we do not need anything they will close the chat, hitting end instantly!! Crafty and useless, the staff and the company! Back to the online chat, requesting a complaint email, still not getting anywhere, told to follow the process already tried and then asked when did I last email... Not sure, but am sure you have a track of all this in customer data?!!? Now, the amount of money we didn't receive is small, yet why should we lose out for their inability to deliver goods? Why should they profit from not delivering goods? Customer service is suppose to appease a customer, to fix the issue, to leave the customer feeling the situation has been addressed and will be handled, not leaving you angry, annoyed and frustrated! To then not be able to speak to anyone but the account holder, even though they do not respond to that person... How on earth does that work? Long story short, take your business somewhere that cares and doesn't take you for granted!"
"November 26, 2016",1,Dreadful customer service,"I have used ASOS for several years happily with no problems until recently. I ordered 2 items which I received the next day as I have premier delivery. Neither were any good, one I requested a refund the other I requested a replacement size. I returned the parcel via royal mail the same day I received the parcel. I never heard anything until I got a message from DPD stating I had a delivery due. I presumed it was my replacement size coat even tho I had had no email from ASOS stating they had received my return. The following day I got the coat. It was no good so I duly returned   it via royal mail. Meanwhile I had started chasing up my refund for the other item in the parcel. ASOS asked me for proof of my return! I stated it was in the parcel which they had already received with the coat in. It took 5 emails and 1 live chat to and 2 weeks to get my refund. In the meantime I never had an email regarding the returned replacement coat either. So I emailed them and attached a copy of the Post Office receipt. I was told I had to wait 21 days for them to receive the return. I emailed them back and said I live in the UK not abroad. They then said they would hand it over to their investigation team. That was weeks ago. I have heard nothing so as it is £85 I have asked my Credit card company to investigate for me and hopefully compensate. No longer will I use ASOS. Their customer service are incompetent, unable to read emails properly, make excuses saying your emails end up in spam boxes. I feel they have dodgy staff working for them in their returns department. Thorough checks need to be made - something needs to be done - sooner rather than later."
"November 24, 2016",5,I've literally never had any problems with Asos <3,"Asos is the place where dreams are made, I have never had a problem with Asos, the clothes are amazing and I am always surprised how quick the deliveries turn up. Keep doing what you're doing Asos! xx"
"November 24, 2016",1,Almost every order has an issue,"I've ordered from ASOS 8 times, 7 orders have had some issue requiring me to contact their customer service. Often this means that an item purchased for next day delivery realistically takes 7 days to arrive, and their customer support is poor."
"November 24, 2016",1,"Computer automated ""Customer care""","Ordered a package and got left a creepy little computer automated message in my inbox. For customer service they had ineffective communication and kind of an inconcern for anything other than telling you to go look at their other items and order more of their apparel. Have read tons upon tons of one star reviews and am convinced the 5 star ratings are just one of the many many members of their terrible communication sector using their ""language degrees"" to deceive those reading reviews."
"November 23, 2016",1,Absolutely horrible.,"I have ordered from Asos a couple of times before to the Netherlands and Slovakia without any issues however, since I have been in France it has been an absolute shi* show. My first order was sent back because I placed the house number at the end of the street name instead before it and the delivery man was  too much of an idiot to look. I have accepted this as my mistake although it took them 2 seconds to take my money and 3 weeks to return it. My second order was placed begining of October and I still dont have the package or my money back. The tracking said it  was delivered to my house while no one called me or brought the package. Asos told me to go looking behind bins or some other area the delivery boy could have left the package  or to try the post office. At the post office they told me the package was sent back however Asos did not have it. All I've gotten past month and a half is a bunch of sorrys but nothing done.. Horrifying service!"
"November 23, 2016",1,DID NOT RESPOND - received a faulty item,"I received a faulty item and sent numerous emails with no response. Finally went through PayPal and was told to return the item to be able to receive a refund, but wouldn't cover the cost. The return postage cost me $52!!!!!  it is ridiculous i am left out of pocket! NOT HAPPY AT ALL horrible communication."
"November 23, 2016",1,BEWARE!,"I have had to stop buy-in on ASOS they are just awful to deal with. International customers beware as they refuse to do international exchanges, so if you buy something during a sale or with a promo code and want to change it for a different size, you have to go and repurchase it at full price! It's just not on and it's just bad business, to only offer exchanges to UK customers because it is more 'convenient' they told me - essentially they can't be bothered to put the time and money into making sure international customers have a good experience. They were so rude and just awful to deal with, frankly their words were just abhorrent."
"November 23, 2016",1,Haven't received my money back,"So I returned 3 items back. $170 dollars. It's been over a month and I haven't received my money back. I've contacted asos through email, chat, facebook and they all tell me to wait. How much more do I need to wait to get my money back? I feel very upset and stressed because idk what else to do to get my money back.  It's a lot of money we're talking about.  I need that money."
"November 22, 2016",5,No issues at all.,"I've had the occasional order hiccup - site's gone down mid-order, discount hasn't applied correctly, courier has gone rogue and lost my order - but ASOS' customer service have been phenomenal through it. They've helped chase down a runaway courier and have him redeliver at 8PM on a weekday (hell yeah!), they've fixed dodgy discounts, and they've been at hand through their chat and Twitter support to help sort out faulty and ripped garments days after the return window has expired and have been all around a pleasure to deal with.On top of it all, their website is constantly being improved upon making ASOS a great service from browsing, to checkout, and everything that comes after. I can never recommend them enough."
"November 22, 2016",5,Totally satisfied. Thanks for ASOS excellent support!,"I would like to say that ASOS customer service is excellent. Two days ago (20th Nov 2016) I bought two watches online. However, because of my carelessness, I didn't realize that I chose my old delivery address. When I knew this problem, my parcel was already dispatched and I would receive them the day later. I chatted with two guys, Dean and Calvin and they supported me so much. My problem is solved now and I entirely satisfied with all they did for me. Thank you so much. Sinh"
"November 22, 2016",1,Delivery,"I've ordered numerous times from ASOS and all was fine until wndirect happened. I usually receive my ASOS packages earlier than the expected arrival date, but this time on the date of my arrival, there are no news of my package so I am getting quite anxious about it. The wnDirect's tracking service is really not helpful at all. The tracking rarely updates itself and even on the expected delivery date, which is today, it still says that my package is 'In Transit'. It doesn't even give me any location of where my package is at the moment, now how is that any good for a tracking service? The whole wnDirect website is very confusing to deal with, especially with how they do any 'tracking'. I sent emails to ASOS but after a whole day and half, no replies.I contacted ASOS on their live chat to enquire on the whereabouts of my package and the ASOS advisor ""Charles"" informed me, on the date of my expected arrival, that my package would be with me within 48 hours, again on the date of my expected arrival. I don't know whats up with ASOS but did Charles really expected me to wait 2 whole days, just sitting at home to wait for my package? So I asked Charles if he could give me the exact location of my package and exactly when would it come and he told me he cannot give me the location at the moment but he would ""get in touch with the courier to get an update and will e-mail me with the results within 48 hours"". Within 48 hours. What's the point Charles? What's the point in emailing me the results within 48 hours when you told me that my package would be with me within the next 48 hours. I want to know where is it now exactly!"
"November 22, 2016",1,The worst,It is the worst company in the whole world. I ordered for a product and cancelled it the next day. Now 45 days later I am still waiting for my refund. They have stopped replying to my emails and I don't know what to do. I advice everyone to never shop from ASOS. This is my first review and I warn everybody about how fraud ASOS is.
"November 21, 2016",5,Excellent online company,"I love asos. Being a lover of online retail this is as good as it gets, great offers, great ideas for promotions, and an excellent members scheme. Where else can you get unlimited next day delivery and returns for 19.99. The returns process has been made very simple and I have never had any issues with them regarding delivery or returns. Fantastic"
"November 21, 2016",5,Great always a positive experience,Asos are fab on one occasion I had lipstick missing they sent it out the next day .ive recently had chain snap on a pair of boots a replacement was out by the next day .fab choice loads of different brands .delivery is always reliable .
"November 20, 2016",2,Untrustworthy and bad customer service,"I brought some over £150 , the package came and was wrong and also empty so someone stollen my item I contacted customer service and she told me to sent the package back so I did so , it had been 5 days and heard nothing then I contacted again and they had no record of my conversation with the first person . Then I got an email saying they were sending me the correct watch next day delivery I got home to find the wrong one again !!! And when I contacted the they gave me no kind of sympathy or gesture of good will for my trouble I am never shopping with asos again . They used to be really good but I have had two people close to me have a parcel go missing and an empty box arrive no thank you"
"November 20, 2016",5,Great Asos,I have only one thing to say. Fast shipping and excellent service. Thank you
"November 20, 2016",1,Dreadful-won't spend another penny on asos again!,"3 weeks ago I received an email from asos informing me there was suspicious activity on my account so it was temporarily blocked until I changed my password. A week later and several calls and emails to asos with no one seemingly able to help me reset my password (wouldn't allow me as my account was blocked) or unblock my account. 3 weeks later I've changed my password, account still blocked and nobody at asos can help! Asos customer care do not reply via email, the chat does not work and I've just given up! I've spent thousands of £s on Asos, won't be spending a penny more. Awful!"
"November 19, 2016",1,worst online experience,"I ordered a dress on the website, and when it came it was the wrong dress.it was the wrong size, different designer not even remotely similar. I go on Facebook and they were seemingly polite saying they had my size even though the website didn't show it and i was told it was be sent immediately out. A few days later i receive an email that the dress was out of stock and I could not receive the dress i ordered. hearing conflicting information, was the most annoying part. this was my first time shopping here and i will never buy anything else from them.  don't buy from them!"
"November 19, 2016",1,Worst service ever!!!,"My parcel was due before or on the 18th November, had an email on the 16th to advise had been dispatched, parcel never arrived, from the evening of the 18th I wad no longer able to track the parcel online and said parcel not found, so I knew it was ""missing"" most likely stolen.Got cut off Web chat, no response from customer care email address or Facebook message, was cut off after 10 minute phone call. If they don't know the answer to your question they cut you off.After another 30 minute phone call they said it will be with me today.it's not here! Couldn't explain why is was no untraceable and why it had been dispatched 3 days ago but how now disappeared. The worst of it is they will not refund your money until they complete their investigation, so whilst they investigate into their thieving delivery drivers they keep your money!They said they had to make sure I don't have it, my parcel was being delivered to a click and collect point and not my home address so there was no way I could have it.Rude customer service operator who just interupt you and clearly have a script to follow Will never use again, still no refund, and head office un contactable Would strongly discourage people from ordering, if you do good luck with getting any issues resolved"
"November 19, 2016",1,AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I ordered a pair of shoes a month ago. I didn't receive them! (although their tracking service says that it was delivered) I have been trying to reach them for the last one month, no one ever follows up with an email. latest response I got was ""have you checked the doorway?"". Seriously? How stupid can I be, to not check the doorway, before writing a complaint? I just sent my fifth email. Will keep sending, don't know when I'll get a proper response, or will basically understand that I wasted my money with this terrible company."
"November 18, 2016",1,Horrible customer service,"It is known that Asos products are really low quality, but their customer service is even worse. If you have the slightest problem with your order, well good luck to you.Edit: 3 weeks after I received a faulty item, I still haven't got my money back. Worst service ever.Edit2: 2 months after receiving a faulty item, still no refund..."
"November 18, 2016",1,Beware of ridiculous customer policy!,"My family & i, have been happy customers of Asos for many years now, no complaints at all.   Until now.   I spent a lot of time placing an order for 14 Tops for my husband, took a lot of time going through them all with him, he doesn't like shopping, so he makes it quite a chore for me!  Anyways, i came back from my holidays in Uk to find i have received someone else's order.  It is a pair of white tennis shoes & a credit card holder the person's order number is 233508164 (just incase you are looking for your order).     Now this is not a problem  soi thought & i called customer service, that is..... after searching the internet for the number as it is not clearly written anywhere on the Asos website.  I spoke to a lovely customer service lady in Glasgow by the name of Chelsea who was very sweet , i know just doing her job.  She politely told me, nothing she can do, but refund me & all those tops now that i ordered weeks ago are out of stock!  I asked but what about the person who has my order or if my order gets sent back to you, she informed me there is nothing she can do about it.  How ridiculous is that?  You can't put a note in your system for when a wrong order turns up to hold it & send it on the rightful customer who spent her valuable time placing the order.   We purposely didn't buy my husband any clothes on our trip to London as we has placed this order online, now to no avail?    What kinda customer service is that?   I spent my valuable time placing an order & calling you to return some one else's order that i have received & yet you can't even spend the time to just make sure my orders gets to me?   The orders are tracked aren't they & delivered by courier?  It is more than likely then that the person who's order i have has mine right?   So why can't someone just pop the order number in the system & call the person who's order i have to see if they have mine & get it sent back to me, how is that so difficult?   By the way, nothing was mentioned to me either about what to do with this poor person's order that i have here too?   That's not very nice is it, i don't want someone else's order!!!!!!   Well i can't bothered dealing with this again , you have lost mine & my family's custom.  Why bother ordering with you when you can't even make sure it gets to me?  I understand accidents happen & people get sent wrong orders but at least do the right thing Asos & get the order eventually to the customer, it's not that hard."
"November 17, 2016",4,good price,good prices. slow delivery but it is ok.
"November 17, 2016",4,Great,"I have ordered many times from asos, it is always fine and the delivery time is fine."
"November 17, 2016",1,Terrible customer service!!,"I'm not one to write a review on anything but ASOS customer service is so appalling I really had to warn others. If ever you encounter an issue when shopping with ASOS, do not expect it to be resolved quickly, politely, or at all. I have had several issues lately, from parcels not turning up yet being recorded as delivered when they are still sat in the hub, to student codes being rejected. I usually opt for 'chat with us' as a point of contact because if you email them a query you're growing old and grey before you get a response. But you just can't win, if you ask them something they can't answer they simply close down the chat without responding to your query. I have recently logged an issue about my student code not being accepted and had 3 chats closed down as they refuse to help. ASOS are just not worth the hassle anymore."
"November 17, 2016",1,CRAP customer service,"They don't care about you. I paid premiership just to get express delivery. 2 of my orders were still processing after 4 days when it should have arrived. The customer service REP name FRANKIE is hopeless. His responses are all automated and not helping at all. Very disappointed with this service team. 1 of my orders never made it out of U.K., he didn't even check for me, I had to call DHL to find out instead."
"November 17, 2016",5,Great customer service!,"I had a item that arrived faultyI wrote to customer service (they were a bit slow in replying but never the less) the replied that they were sorry the hear about the faulty item and had already arranged for a new item to be sent to me. They also wrote that i shouldn't worry about returning the faulty item, i should just ""dispose of it in the most environmentally friendly way possible""So very helpful, friendly and environmentally aware, I LOVE it!Thank you so much Francesca from Customer Care :D"
"November 16, 2016",4,Their Customer Service is Slow Via Email (Use Chat),"ASOS is pretty good. They dispatch things really fast (usually within 1 day) and the items are lightning quick delivery considering that it usually comes from the UK. They also offer expedited shipping for free over a certain amount. Sometimes stuff arrives quicker than when I buy from Australia.The quality of ASOS branded stuff is decent-- but it is very hit and miss. Some of it can be bad, but the same goes for a lot of places, like Target, etc. That said, occasionally there are bargains to be had, and they also carry branded stuff, and the quality is pretty great for that. They also sometimes carry hard to find items, and they often have good outlet sales. You have to be quick though, people pounce on their sales a lot.One thing that is bad is their exchange rate for Australia is pretty useless. You pay 20-70 dollars more on the Australian site for certain items, compared to GBP. They really need to fix this; other UK/Overseas retailers do not struggle with the exchange rate so much. Also, customer service (emails) can be really slow: It does take 3 days for them to reply. It used to be better, but I think that it is inundated now. They lost an order of mine recently, and I emailed them and it was taking so long for them to reply, that I went online and used their Chat service instead. On the plus side, their chat service is fantastic, I only waited about 10 minutes for a customer service rep, they looked into it immediately, fixed everything and re-sent my order within 1 day, and everything was sorted. In the meantime, the email inquiry actually received a reply 3 days later even though my order had been fixed up and re-sent. The dude was confused and told me that my order was fine and due to arrive the next day-- yes of course it was fine, now-- the chat rep had it re-shipped two days earlier for me because it had been lost.So I mean, I wasn't upset, but they really really need a ticketing system, whereby your query generates a ticket and when it is resolved, they close the ticket. There was no way for me to 'cancel' my email inquiry, and them responding to it was literally double handling and wasting time they could have used to help someone else. That said, they were very nice, but they need a better system.That said, their free returns are fantastic and are the main reason why I have been using them more, and I think they are pretty great. Not many places offer free returns-- especially not on change of mind returns-- and these are hassle free and fast. They do take a while to go back into your account, though, but that's understandable.All in all, don't be dissuaded from bad reviews and give it a try. If you are super impatient then perhaps don't bother, but in my experience they do try their best to fix any issues that occur, even if it takes them a long while."
"November 15, 2016",1,They dont care about you,"Look, things happen when it comes to online shopping. Shipping can get messed up and deliveries can go missing. But this is something any online business must prepare for, and how they handle it after the fact is what separates good customer service from bad. ASOS is on the very bad side of that spectrum. They claim to be a 24 hours a day 7 days a week customer service. I sent an email, and did not get a response for 80 hours. Thats 3+ days. On top of that, the email gave me non helpful advice. Check the post office, check your neighbors, search your driveway all over. I think 3 days was enough time for me to do that. But ok, youre covering the bases and its holiday season, so ill let it go. I respond within an hour of their email telling them ive done everything they suggested and that i want to know what the next steps are. 8 hours later, no response. So i get on an online live chat and the guy helps me get a re order, says it will take up to 24 hours to process. 25 hours later, no email, no notice of my order update. So i connect yet again on messenger only to be told that my order was refunded because they were out of stock. I checked my spam/junk email. No notice of this even happening. So i was just supposed to guess, i guess? Very disappointing, because this was a gift that my S/O and i were excited about. Now we will never buy from ASOS again. A worker there may say good riddance, but what happened to the business practice, that it is unacceptable to lose a customer for something within your control as a business. Ill reiterate. Im fine that the product didnt arrive and that the process had a mixup. Im not fine with how it was handled after the fact, and the amount of effort I had to go through to get answers/compensation.Jake Balderama"
"November 15, 2016",1,Didn't even get my item,They didn't deliver my parcel but were quick to take the money. Customer service has been disgraceful. No one has to even tried to help. No one to ring. Never ordering with them. It's a shame because I really did this like company.
"November 15, 2016",3,"Great, until something goes wrong","I've been a loyal customer for years; wide range of clothing styles, from a range of brands, all in one place which offers free UK delivery and free returns - what's not to love? Only recently they've been slipping on quality and customer service. I've had a number of their own brand items arrive with faulty seams or wonky zips, which doesn't usually bother me as they're normally only cheap any way and the kind of fault half an hour with a sewing kit will fix. However, I just recently bought a dress for a funeral for £42 where the zip totally jammed while I was trying it on, and the only way to get out was to break the zip. I messaged asos through Facebook to look into their policy for exchange/refund of the item in this condition and after 3 messages back I'm still none the wiser! Each person manning their Facebook says something different! One says I can exchange (even though I explained this was not possible in the time frame), another says I might get a refund, and the last says simply to return it and see what happens. Only because I need the dress relatively soon am I ordering a replacement, very interested to see how they eventually do handle the broken dress though."
"November 15, 2016",5,"ASOS, oh ASOS how I love thee","ASOS, if you were a man I would be your wifey!!! Your selection of clothing, shoes etc is AMAZING! As for your prices - they are the cream on the cupcake! I adore being an ASOS A-lister! I get money off vouchers, early sneak peaks and extra bonuses to make me feel better every time I get older at that special time of the year! You really know how to make a chick feel good! Thank you for your easy return service and your excellent customer service! Please don't make it so easy for me to spend so much money on your fab products!! Love alwaysMichelle xxxxx"
"November 14, 2016",1,Yikes,"I've been having a poor customer service experience that's dragged on for a couple days. Money was taken from my bank account (via PayPal) for items that I attempted to purchase. Then I received an email saying ""We're really sorry, but we were unable to complete your order as your Paypal payment failed."" Only.... you do actually have my $75.50, and I have no merchandise. Your terrible ""Chat with us"" feature on your site connects me to individuals who clearly do not have access to your bank records. Then, when I explain everything fully, they reply with the same stock answers. I've spoken to 4 different chat specialists, all of whom were unhelpful. I'm at a loss. This was a terrible experience. Then, after messaging with 3 or 4 employees on ASOS's facebook response team... I wound up getting an offer for 10% off my next order... which would be 5% MORE than I was paying in the first place, as the items had returned to full price. the 2 pack now cost $52 and the joggers are now $43seriously. ASOS knows how to run a scam on it's clients.I'd have to pay $95 (which is $85.50 with your measly discount) vs the $75.50 I would paid 2 days ago.You expect me to pay $10 more.... after the crummy service experience?"
"November 14, 2016",1,Appalling customer service - won't trust them again,"Won't be shopping on Asos again! Ordered a pair of trainers and they came as odd shoes, when I contacted them after being ignored for ages they said there is nothing they can do as they've ran out of stock! Unbelievable service and not a happy customer!!!Lost a customer and their trust..."
"November 14, 2016",5,Surprised to see bad reviews,"I was about to order a playsuit from a different company and went in here to see all the reviews. Which were really bad. So as a curiosity, I have typed ASOS as most of my clothing actually from this company, just to compare... I was very chocked to see all these bad reviews. So I though I would write about my experience with the online shopping. I LOVE ASOS, I will say 80% of my cloths are from there. *** COMMUNICATIONGreat communications. Any problems I ever had, I always had someone at the other end getting back to me promptly. Don't get me wrong I have experienced some problems, but nothing too major. Put it that way, I had far more good experiences than bad ones.*** REFUNDSuper easy to send back. You can either drop it off at the post office or at a collect + point. And I usually got the money within the time frame said on the website. Never had a single problem with that. Once I bough a pair of hearings, which broke within few days. They send me a new pair, no questions asked.*** Problems or delayObviously there are no perfect companies, and mistake happens. When it does happen (late delivery, wrong items) I am awarded with apology and have a 10% discount straight away.In 7 years, a late delivery happened once. Wrong item happened once too.I got to know my body quite well pretty much thanks for shopping at ASOS so many times that I know what would fit me or not. But usually what you see is what you get.I love shopping with ASOS. They are quite prompt to answer, GREAT products. The only bad thing is the cloth are not the cheapest. However, you get the occasional discount.  But because I am addicted, I can't look away. Few years ago, around christmas they had 40% on everything, I had a field day.I am a very happy customers since 2009. Don't be put off by all the bad reviews. I am sure they are valid, but if I never had dealt with ASOS and I went in here to find out more I would have walked away, that is why I though writing a genuine review would set the record straight. Any way happy shopping !!"
"November 14, 2016",1,"Awful, won't use ASOS again.","I ordered in good faith of receiving my item on time. Almost 2 weeks later and after various emails and twitter DM's, often repeating what I had said already, no help was actually given apart from what I already knew. One advisor even said that it had been delayed because my address has changed - I've lived at the same address my whole life. It eventually turns up, on my door step!!! Not happy, and ASOS don't seem to care - yes, they refunded my delivery charge, but only after I asked for it back! Not even a discount offered for such a shambles of a service. This was the second time out of three orders that didn't arrive on time. Never again."
"November 13, 2016",1,"No delivery, shocking customer service!!!!!","I placed an order online which I extended to over £100 to get free next day delivery. I was later informed that my order had been delayed. As I am away and need it for this week I asked if it can be sent to another collection point instead of my address. The customer advisor supposedly assisting was awful, made no attempt to find out what's going on and could not cancel the order either. I've also checked with dpd tracking and it states the order has not been received yet I'm being told to contact dpd myself therefore the parcel is still with ASOS. I was also suggested to wait at home incase they do deliver...however the messages state my order will not be delivered today and the 'advisor' states it may be delivered today?! Get your story straight!!!! Stop wasting my time!!! The advisor also was very rude and unhelpful and was very keen to end the chat stating that s/he has answered my questions. I asked for his/her name so I can make a complaint to the head of the department but I was repeatedly told 'I am the complaints department'. The attitude alone says a lot about your staff and company.ASOS do something about it! Look at the ratings and majority of reviews, you may be an online business but if you don't understand what customer service is then why are you in this business???!!!!"
"November 12, 2016",1,Poor Transparency,"I've ordered from Asos numerous times but this latest time was a disaster. Firstly I will say that under normal circumstances I fully understand that once orders are processed that they can't offer refunds. However, considering the huge email confirmation and order history errors over this weekend (12/11) I would have expected there would be some leniency. As others have done after viewing their Twitter feed, I placed an order but didn't receive any confirmation via email or on site so I placed it again. This was a large one off order of over £200 so to be charged twice at nearly £450 is going to have an impact on my bank account. Asos live chat informed me that banners were displayed all over the site but over the tablet and mobile site there was not one mention of any technical errors they were experiencing. It was only after placing my order I went to the help section that I spotted these ""banners all over the site"". As someone who works with ecommerce sites I was quite surprised to learn that the 'help' section was ""all over the site"". Their live chat service, customer rep Zoya was adamant that this was all over the site however."
"November 12, 2016",1,Rubbish,I didn't realise asos was a online charity shop . My daughter ordered a dress for a wedding cost £70 when it arrived it had been worn was dirty and torn they are now saying that dress is no longer available and the best they can offer is 10% discount off her next order . Point 1 is she is a student so gets 10% discount anyway point 2 she won't be ordering from this tatty expensive online charity shop again
"November 12, 2016",1,Terrible,"About half the things that i've ever ordered have looked somewhat like they do on the website and haven't been of bad quality. This is not great news since the delivery and returns are atrocious. Decided to only ever buy accessories and items that aren't clothing so i wouldn't risk it not fitting me and having to send it back and never get any money back. But now i've received a double order and have been billed twice so have to send things back anyway. Customer service claims i ordered the same things twice, but i wasn't shopping whilst drunk so i don't see how that could have happened without me noticing. Never asos again."
"November 12, 2016",1,Delivery,"Delivery service is very very poor.Its only works with pick up but when customers pay extra money for next day delivery it's not worth it.I order coat day before for next day delivery,paid extra 5.95 but delivery service couldn't find my address.But they have contact details and they even didn't call.Now I need to go and collect my self from closest pickup point."
"November 11, 2016",5,I didnt have a problem,I saw a pair of rare timberland boots i had been looking for for a few months i saw them on this website i looked up the reviews first and they weren't to positive from what i read the customer service was bad and shipping took forever so i was nervous but i had to have these boots so I gave it a try i recieved a confirmation number and a tracking number not even a day later i placed my order october 31 and received my order november 7th and i am gassed im love my boots im in virgina usa so i advise when you order just keep in mind there uk sizes but mine fit perfect normally i dont write reviews but by my experience i felt like this site  was getting a bad rap so i wanted to show them some love so before you read reviews and decide not to order from this site remember only mostly dissatisfied customers write reviews people who are happy dont usually write so i decided this site needed someone to break that trend😊 im not saying their perfect im just saying I didnt have a problem and there definitely worth a try.
"November 10, 2016",1,Worst customer service,"ASOS make it so difficult to get in contact if you have any problems with ordering / their website / delivery etc. When you do finally get through to the online chat they are really slow to reply, extremely unhelpful and just leave the chat if they can't help. Really unacceptable service. I love the clothes on asos but the customer service and Hermes delivery service puts me right off of ordering again!"
"November 10, 2016",1,Worst website in this world!,"Asos have no idea what good service is. When you complain in the chat function on the website, they just close the chat if the dont want to answer. They send me a wrong size first, then they send a replacement, but didn't put the correct adress on it, so it was returned to sender. Then when i contact them about it, they say they will send me the refund once the parcel has arrived back and from there it will take 7-10 days for me to get the money back. How is it that i am the one getting punished when the mistake was made be Them? Twice even!! And then they try an put on me by saying that they have put the adress i have on my profile, but my local postal service that had to return it to sender, have proof that they in fact didn't put that adress on it. They just tell you sorry and that i can purchase a new one. Like i am going to do that when they have both my money and my item! The least they could do was to give some sort of discount as a way to say sorry for everything. Everyone i know who had been shopping on ASOS has had trouble with them, and they keep on saying that they can assure me that this doesn't happen often. Stop lying and get better people to run the customer care team!"
"November 10, 2016",1,I would give 0 stars if possible,"I made an order with ASOS, ended up purchasing a couple bathing suits. I am beyond disappointed with my purchase. My order was suppose to arrive on November 2nd, and by November 4 it still wasn't here so I emailed the company asking where it was. They told me to wait until November 19. I was very upset with this because I only ordered with them because customer service said it would arrive before I leave for my vacation. And if it arrived on the 19 that was after I left. I expressed my problem with this and the woman basically told me that it's unfortunate but nothing she can do. So I requested a refund. She told me to KEEP the bathing suits for my next vacation, and before I had a chance to respond she ended the chat. I was very upset but decided to let it go because there was still a chance it would get here before my vacation. Today, November 10th I finally received my package. My package had 47$ worth of duty fees. I understand that this isn't entirely ASOS fault, however the delivery company based their % of duty on the weight of the package. The package had a couple light bathing suits in it. But somehow the package weighed a hefty amount due to unneccessary wrapping. I will never be ordering from their company again and have already advised all my friends to steer clear as well."
"November 09, 2016",1,Disgusting!!!,"Not long ago I reviewed Asos after they cancelled my order but still took payment. It took me 14 days and several calls and messages to get my money back. I today am reviewing after they did the exact same thing!! But not only have they taken payment twice, they have taken it a third time!! And similar to the last time, I'm told to wait up to 10 days for it to be refunded again. Customer Service refuse to put you through to a manager to discuss further, refuse to provide you with Head Offices details (despite them being freely available online!?), refuse to guarantee a call back from any manager and have less empathy than a peanut! Disgusting service and absolutely shocked this can happen again."
"November 09, 2016",1,"Terribly poor service, they dont care about anything","Asos fail to deliver items, they even fail to collect refunds working with Hermes and DPD, theyre approach to customer service is nonchalant and dissmissive and they dont deserve my money or time. Their products come up small i'm a size 10 woman things dont fitand quality is terrible. I work too hard for my money to spend it on such poor everything."
"November 08, 2016",1,Unreliable and Unscrupulous,"I returned 5 items in the same bag using Collect Plus.  I emailed to enquire why I had not been refunded the correct amount giving the order number, payment details, copy return receipt and copy delivery note but didn't realise that the original order had been placed from my daughters email address.  Customer Services would not communicate with me at all unless I emailed from the same email address from which I placed the order.  This I did again providing all the above and have been advised that I should have used an insured return method even though the Asos website advises Collect Plus as an option.  However, the method of return and whether it is insured should make no difference as the bag was obviously received by Asos as I received a partial refund which they advise me is for 2 of the items.  I am getting the impression that they will try any method to avoid having to make a refund regardless of fault or responsibility.  Do not use this company.  They have no integrity."
"November 07, 2016",1,Great until there's a problem.,"I've been ordering from ASOS for about 3 years and regularly too (I'd say at least an order every 2 weeks) and have never had any problems until now.I ordered on there Halloween 20% off day all was going great until a few hours later I got an email from ASOS to say my PayPal transaction was  unsuccessful. I checked my bank account and all was well so thought it must be just a glitch and my money wouldn't leave the account, I was wrong. A few days later the money left my account and I immediately contacted ASOS who said that my funds were just pending I repeatedly reassured them they weren't pending they had left my account and I did this via email via instant chat and via twitter and got the same (word for word same) reply each time, my funds were pending and PayPal would release them in 5 days. They would not believe my money had been taken and instead said I was 'mistaken' so I opened a dispute on PayPal who investigated it and I got a full refund. If it wasn't for PayPal I would've never got my money back as they would not believe they even took it, when I sent bank statements to them they still refused to accept they had taken the money and had had it for over a week. Awful service, will never again be using ASOS."
"November 07, 2016",1,Still no items after 3 week. Is ASOS still in business or is it a scam?,"Made an order of 280e in total, was suppose to arrive 22nd october still haven't and todays 7th nov. contacted them and still no answer. I might've lost 280e. Does anyone know if asos is still in business today or is it a scam site???"
"November 07, 2016",2,BEWARE CUSTOMER CARE,"ASOS was having its 20% off sale so I decided to splurge on a new winter coat. BAD IDEA. It arrived suspiciously early and when I came back from my work trip to find the package, it looked way too small to have a jacket inside. It was a thin, hooded sweatshirt in a completely wrong size. I immediately sent ASOS a incorrect item email only to not hear from them for several days. I sent them another email a few days later and contacted customer care through their chat service. The company finally responded but had waited until my item was out of stock when they tried to make the replacement. So now they won't make the replacement at all. I'm getting refunded but if I want to buy the jacket again, it'll have to be in a size too big with no discount. I'm very disappointed in their service and will only buy cheap items, if anything at all, from now on."
"November 05, 2016",1,customer service,"Called regarding a parcel that should have arrived yesterday before 6 pm...I had received a msg to say someone had tried to deliver at 7:25 -- LIE! Customer service can only email Hermes which can take 48 hours,  and Hermes have 3 more delivery attempts. Gobshite on the phone was flapping and "" terminated "" the call. Quick enough to take money though."
"November 05, 2016",5,Favourite place to shop!,The Premier package is so worth it - free courier returns and express delivery for the whole year is absolutely so good for me :)Being in Australia you still have to wait 3 days for it to arrive but the quality and price is always really good.Love shopping here.
"November 04, 2016",1,Worst experience ever,"I made an order,payed tax., but got a totally wrong order. Did not accept the order and contacted customer service straight away. They sent it again, with a different carrier.., and asked me to pay taxes and fees... Asos refused to carry the taxes coused by their mistake!! I refused the delivery..and am tired of corresponding with them ever since with no one to talk to. It's been over a month and they have yet to refund me!!! Thank"
"November 03, 2016",5,Good service,I have ordered so many times and have received the best service for all my orders yet..
"November 03, 2016",1,Bad customer service,"I shop here a lot and it really bothers me that their customer service is so horrible. They wont honor price adjustments, even when an order was placed a day before and now everything I ordered is on sale 20%. They want me to order another order and return the old order. Isnt that more work for you? Just honor the adjustment and you will have less work, and you will have angered me WAY less. They remove all discounts on the whole order if you return just a part of the order. When you pressure them by saying that this is bad business practice as every other competitor of theirs honors price adjustments, and doesnt just screw their customers out of discounts - they just say ""sorry"". I mean, take some hints from amazon - they have amazing customer service and sometimes take the financial fall for customers, but in return, you have incredible customer loyalty. It is hard to be loyal to ASOS when they plainly take your money and run."
"November 03, 2016",1,Items never turned up,Brought a few items with standard delivery 2 weeks before I needed them. Tracked my order 5 days later and was told it had been delivered safely to my address? ASOS passed it over the their investigations team but i am still waiting to hear back. As it has taken so long I no longer need the items and had to find alternatives last minute. Won't be buying from them again. I wonder where my package actually ended up..
"November 03, 2016",1,Worst costumerservice ever!,"A free days ago I placed an order and paid it with iDeal (i'm Dutch). It was 204 euro. Untill this day I have not recieved a conformation email. I start to chat with asos costumer service. They asked my order number, but I don't have one because I'm still waiting for my conformation email. My order doesn't exist. So I asked my money back. She said there were IT problems and I had to talk to my bank because my bank was holding back my money. Later in the conversation she said there weren't any IT of tech problems. Than she closed the conversation.I contacted my bank, they say ASOS is holding back my money, so it's up to ASOS to give me my money back.With this outcome I started an other chat. She said again there were IT problems. And it will take 5 to 10 workdays to give me my money back. So I'm still waiting....This was my first and last time I will ever buy something from ASOS. I don't reccommend it at all!!!"
"November 03, 2016",1,"Worst customer service, lost parcels, refund refusal!","I have purchased with ASOS for years. I have never really had an issue until this past week. 2 orders of mine to be exact problems arose. Their customer service team on the chat is absolutely hopeless and just downright rude. They don't deserve the title of customer service. Watch out if you get someone called Sinead on the chat! Lost an item of mine, no tracking details they said to wait another week for delivery. Sent another item for a refund the tracking shows they received it and still haven't given me my refund. Have now had to make a Paypal claim because they don't care about their customers."
"November 03, 2016",5,Loved my dress!!,"I have a ""dress to impress"" event to go to for work, I found a beautiful dress on Asos. I read several negative reviews online beforehand, so I had my reservations on whether to trust the site; I'm glad I did. The dress looks absolutely amazing on, and my order showed up at my doorstep within two days. I'm super happy with my purchase."
"November 02, 2016",1,Terrible experience and inexistent customer service,"Living in Asia, I placed an order expecting long delivery lead time. Indeed, ASOS emailed me on despatch date and estimated delivery lead time to 20 days or less. For 29 days, I received absolutely no notification, neither by email nor by phone, until I got an automated email stating my home address was incorrect (although it wasn't). It was impossible to track my order from ASOS website. It's been more than a month, and I still have no idea  where my order is or whether I can get a refund. After days of looking for a direct customer services phone number or email address, I sent an message yesterday through ASOS website and still haven't heard from them. Such incompetency is appalling!"
"November 02, 2016",1,Worst experience ever,"When making an order I have applied a promo code of 17% discount, some items didn't fit so I shipped them back. ASOS received the items but then deducted the amount of the discount applied to the full order from the single items! So not only did I pay for the shipping, Asos got back the items and I received only 10-20 % of thir price that didn't even cover the shipping! Unfair! Will never recommend to anyone!"
"November 02, 2016",1,Poor customer service,"This company literally couldn't care less about you as a customer.I placed 4 orders within 5 days of each other, 3 of them didn't turn up next day even though I pay yearly for this. Whenever I contacted them they just told me to wait and promised me that they would contact me within 48 hours which never happened. Whilst using live chat I told them I was fed up and just wanted a refund for the amount I paid for the next day delivery, and they literally said no and then ended the chat within a second, not leaving me any chance to reply. This is the equivalent of hanging the phone up on a customer in my opinion which we would get fired for at my place of work.Absolutely appalled and left with no choices here. Looking at the rest of the Trustpilot feedback they clearly don't care and probably won't even read this."
"November 01, 2016",1,"Refuses to inform about customer rights, fishy","Been having some issues regarding a refund. None of the three people I've tried to contact in the chat has given me answer, in spite of the fact that I've rephrased the question several times - they are completely vague, and in the end, they simply close the chat. Pretty unacceptable, especially since my issue is mainly their own lack of clarity.Backstory: I bought a bag and a blouse well over a month ago. I soon realised that the item was sent to the wrong address, so I wrote to ASOS that I wanted the item returned and a refund - then I'd buy the same items again immediately. ASOS told me: no can do. I'd have to wait 'till they received the item from DPD again, and then I'd wait up to 14 days for a refund. I pressed on, but the guy in the chat told me that those were the rules. So I accepted. Yet I later read that this is wrong! According to what I have read,(it was on the Internet, so I'd take it with a grain of salt) ASOS is supposed to give me a refund within 7 working days as soon as they order the item back from the courier - they shouldn't demand to receive the item at first. Unfortunately I lost the query number for this interaction.Current issue:Well, I ordered the items yet again and waited patiently for a refund. And I got one, though only for one of the two items(the bag; the blouse was not even listed as received in their confirmation mail, even though they were sent in the same bag). I reported this, and an investigation was apparently started around oct. 4th, yet I never heard from them. When I wrote again, they simply told me they needed to 'start fresh' on ANOTHER investigation.They told me that I needed to wait 48 hours yet again, then they'd report back on what the courier had to say. I asked them ""Well, what if the courier doesn't know what happened to the item, and the issue cannot be resolved? Will I get my money back, then?"". And they simply refuse to answer. Twice now they've closed the chat, and just flat-out ignore me on Facebook. I don't know exactly what to do, as I have no idea what my rights regarding this is. ASOS apparently can't inform me on this simple issue, so it's one star from me."
"November 01, 2016",1,Bad customer service,"I have placed an order and bought the next day delivery subscription. The next day when I am supposed to receive my order, I have noticed that in my ASOS account the status was unsuccessful. Contacted the customer service to get more information, they said that the payment didn't go through and the amount will be hold from my card for few days!I didn't receive any notification about the order status and it doesn't make sens that the amount will be hold from my card if the payment wasnt authorized.All what I got in exchange was a sorry and order again !"
"November 01, 2016",5,Super!,order n: 233096789delivery and goods = excellent!!!
"October 31, 2016",1,Unapologetic and unsatisfactory,"Order over £100 worth of goods with express delivery for a wedding, 1 week later I haven't recieved delivery, on phoning dpd the delivery company I'm told asos have sent it to my old address even after I typed in my new address! Dpd can't change delivery address they tell me asos have to, I phone asos explain I'm nearly2 weeks in after waiting on a delivery I need it by Friday I selected express delivery but they have made an error with the delivery address. I was told they would not be changing the delivery address and the best that could happen was a refund which could take 12days to process! The wedding is this Saturday and to be completely honest even though I find it a bit of a nuisance that they won't just change the delivery address after confirming who you are (and dpd telling me they have done it previously for customers) I probably would not have left a negative review if the customer service hadn't been so poor! The women was clearly irritated at dealing with me and my questioning why they don't change delivery addresses. I was spoken to rudely and she clearly had no sympathy I genuinely won't shop here again and I used to love asos (even got my maternity wear from them) but it feels like a kick in the teeth to be spoken to like that as a loyal customer."
"October 31, 2016",1,Horrible customer service,"ASOS has the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my entire life. I was guaranteed 4-day delivery and I have yet to receive my package after 3 weeks. I have engaged in online chat with them twice, one of which was ended by their representative after 20 minutes of making me wait for a response. I also emailed their customer care who took four days to respond and did not provide me with any helpful information. I cannot locate my package because they did not and will not provide me with a tracking number."
"October 31, 2016",1,Bad Customer Service,I will definitely not order again from asos! I have been promised to receive the package in 2 weeks. I received HALF of the package after 3 weeks. it has been a month now and I still did not receive my second half. I talked to them in the online chat at least 4 times. Every time they keep telling me to wait for an email in 2 days and I still did not get any email. I should have gotten 3 emails from them by now and I did not even get 1. I just talked to them and they said the same thing. I am positive that when I talk to them after 2 days the same thing will be said to me. Very Bad customer service! They can't give you a date and then not stick to their word!
"October 31, 2016",1,Abysmal customer service,"WORST EVER!!!Never in my life have I experienced such horrible and evasive customer service. Unless you enjoy wasting your time arguing, complaining  or returning faulty items - steer clear at all costs!! The way Asos treat their customers is completely unacceptable and a very frustrating experience. They simply seem to stall - wasting your time - until you give up. NOT EVEN CLOSE TO SATISFACTORY."
"October 31, 2016",1,Very bad service,"Doesn't deliver on time, unhelpful customer service team"
"October 30, 2016",1,Terrible customer service,"Son received gift card for his birthday, was much on website for him but found some things, ordered them.When they arrived the jeans didn't fit so returned them, twelve days later after hearing nothing we contacted the help advisors as we'd asked for an exchange but hadn't received anything.Went through three advisors before finally getting answers.Turns out they'd decided to refund not exchange, no email was ever received to say this. Advisor said that we could reorder now refunded the money to his gift card however we would now have to pay delivery even though with exchanges it's free delivery.They also told him that as he was under 18 he should open another account under his parents name and DOB!!! How this would help the matter I don't know!One advisor told him to turn off cookies so they could access his account!!Rubbish service and rubbish site. Now can't replace what we sent back and have a credit we'll probably never use!"
"October 29, 2016",1,Extremely slow shipping and straight-up lies about arrival time.,"Item didn't show until a week after it was supposed to. By then, it was too late for me to use."
"October 29, 2016",1,no show of  delivery no customer service what so ever,"diabolical will never use again,absolutely terrible"
"October 28, 2016",1,terrible,"Item did not arrive, and customer service is the worse! DONT buy from them!"
"October 28, 2016",1,DO NOTTTTTTTTT,"The moment my item was delivered to me I contacted asos twitter team via DM to let them know that my jacket had a hole in it along with beads falling off. I let them know that they needed to send me a replacement IMMEDIATELY SINCE ITS MY BDAY WEEKEND and I was suppose to wear it saturday. They insisted that it would take 1-2 business days to arrive and rest assured that they will send one out. Moments later they then changed their minds and said, We have to wait to receive the faullty one before we ship out replacement. I then let them know thats not fair and that they sent me faulty items. They then agreed that once I drop it off to usps, I would get a replacement sent out that moment. I dropped it off and messaged them letting them know and they lied to me again. They then say ""we have to wait 10 days before replacement is sent"" I am being lied to constantly and I keep getting the run around. I will never do business AGAIN ORDER NUMBER 232591647"
"October 27, 2016",1,Tricky awful,Worst customer care I have recieved. My complaint has been on going for 4 months and it is still not resolved. The item I bought as a gift was faulty.  I'd never buy from this company again .
"October 25, 2016",5,Great,Everything was just good!
"October 25, 2016",2,Worst of the worst,"Placed an order. No confirmation mail. No actual help, just the following response: bare with us and wait 10 days. If you don't get a confirmation on the order or your money, contact us again............... What the actual ^&*#. That is no customer service. That is ignoring the problem and not caring for the customer.I just lost 330 euro's for about a month, if not longer. This is the second time this has happend! The last time I spend more then a month emailing back and forward before something happend. I don't want to spend the time or energy convincing someone I placed an order and feeling like an idiot. Because that's how you get treated if there is a problem."
"October 25, 2016",2,"Quality, Quality, Quality (needs work)","I love the idea of ASOS, but I nearly always forget every time just how poor the item quality is until it arrives.  Top marks for your styling & photography departments for making these clothes look great on the website.  Once arrived, a sea of badly finished, badly fitting viscose/poly materials awaits.  Crushing disappointment for product quality, which is a shame because your service is on the whole pretty good. :("
"October 24, 2016",1,Asos use child slave labour!!!,Never buy from Asos as they use child slave labour to make their clothes!!!!
"October 24, 2016",1,"Bad customer support, worst purchase experience ever",I can't recommend trading with this company. They don't seem to have any understanding for complaints regarding their products.
"October 24, 2016",1,no customer service,"I've only marked them so high because you cant go lower than 1 star!!The lesson I have learnt is to never trust a company that wont let you talk to them. When a delivery didn't arrive i used their chat to find out what had happened. They said there had been a problem and i would get it a couple of days late. When it still didn't arrive they said the delivery team would contact me. When no one contacted me i went on-line again. they apologised and said the delivery team would contact me. i said no i wanted a refund, and wanted to speak to someone. They refused to give a number, but promised someone would call back. Still heard nothing so i contacted them again - this time they said the refund was being processed and would be in my bank within 5 days (I can transfer money to someone in 5 seconds!)8 days later - still no money in my bank and no-one contacted me. I contacted them again - they have no record of requests for a call back , or promise of a refund, someone will be in touch in 2 days. i have screenshots of the chats. it is no wonder that they wont let you speak to them."
"October 22, 2016",1,Worst Customer Service ever!,"I just would like the customer service representative to do a simple check if the dress had a plain bottom brief under the skirt, just like its bodice version. The customer representative simply replied, ""order it and return after you dislike it."" Come on! There are people who live in countries which has no free returns and have to pay the shipping of an item. Wouldn't it be better that the customer representative do the check and I buy it and done? Whats the point of a customer sales representative then? As an online store, customers aren't able to physically see and know the product as well as in-store purchases. Obviously, as an customer sales representative for an online store, there are more duties to be done. What is the point of a customer/sales representative if they are of no help to the customers!?!Just so to be clear, I gave 1 star solely for its customer service. The 1 star does not reflect any other qualities like clothing quality, shipping quality etc."
"October 22, 2016",3,What is customer service?,"I've bought from ASOS in the past, and never had a problem. This time however, I only bought one item, and I never received it. When I inquired as to where it was, they were incredibly unhelpful telling me to wait a month to see if it would arrive, or that I could just order a new one, and return the other when (or if) it arrives. Like, what? No. Working in retail, customer service is very important to me. They eventually gave me a refund, but their shipping company is obviously in need of a reprimanding."
"October 22, 2016",5,Excellent,Always fast delivery. Never had problems with anything I ordered from ASOS.
"October 21, 2016",5,Excellent,"I had to come leave this review because i just think that Asos is absolutely one of the most reliable online store. shipping is excellent, everything about them is excellent. i ordered something recently and i needed it urgently. i got my package so fast i was so surprised. very happy and content with this store."
"October 21, 2016",5,First choice for online shopping,"I've been a loyal customer of ASOS for at least five years now, and I usually place an order at least once a month if not more. Their delivery and returns service is unlike any other I've came across, it's so quick and truly unbeaten by any other retailers in my opinion. They always have ample choice and something for every price range. I was really surprised to see the amount of negative reviews on here. The few times I've ever had an issue with my order, it was promptly taken care of to my satisfaction by the customer care team. I would highly recommend ASOS, and it will continue to be my first choice for online shopping!"
"October 20, 2016",1,"Worst Service, Excellent Liars","I received wrong item and was offered exchange or refund after shipping back - 14 usd and shipping costs, that was conirmed to be the amount after price adjustment because i used promo code. I prefer refund since the original order was delayed and I didn't want to wait for additional order,so I sent the wrong item. When they got the item they refund me for 1 DOLLAR , although admitted they told me different!!Such a liars! And no one to speak with!"
"October 20, 2016",1,I have been rip off don't buy,They the worst customer service ever I don't think they even exist I get the same email every day with no answere to my problem  THEY charged me twice for my order I have email every day for two weeks have got no were they are rude and don't care I think they just want you give up I have bank statement I have sent them I am going back to the bank to investigate  warning to others do not use this company ASOS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"October 19, 2016",5,Consistently Great,"ASOS has a huge range of clothes at varying prices and I'm in love with their dress section. I ordered dress with a gorgeous sequin embroidery and it looks beautiful in person, I received compliments all night. Website is easy to navigate, and delivery is quick and timely. A free returns form comes in the package, but thankfully after two bulk orders I've yet to return a single thing."
"October 19, 2016",5,Never had any issues.,"Never had a problem with this site, and I've bought plenty of stuff here."
"October 19, 2016",1,TRASH YOUR TIME IN CUSTOMER SERVICES,"The conversation with them in chat is helpless , waste my time like trash !!! too bad in talking to them !!!"
"October 19, 2016",4,Loyal Shopper at ASOS,"I'm looking at all these negative comments about ASOS and their customer service but I've never had any issue with them. Well, except that I can't track most of my orders. I've probably ordered from ASOS 20+ times already. Always quite happy with my shopping experience with them. One time they shipped a shirt that was mislabelled as a pair of gloves. I'm not sure how that mistake occurred but ASOS took care of it right away. They expedited my gloves to me and took full responsibility for the mistake. If you communicate with their customer service via Twitter, they're always more than willing to help you out and communicate quite quickly. I will continue to shop at ASOS. I have been for the last four or so years."
"October 19, 2016",1,Dont buy from Asos,"Ordered an item from Asos and they didn't send it, no money refunded so far. Customer service is rude and seem more interested in keeping to their time limits so they hurry you along with no resolution to the problem.Avoid, nothing but problems"
"October 19, 2016",1,Trash,"they lied about charging my card on a ""canceled order that didn't go through"" and charged 97 bucks still haven't gotten my money back f**king crooks!"
"October 19, 2016",1,Worst Customer Service!,"I've been online shopping for years, and I have officially encountered the worst customer service--with ASOS. I ordered a dress and they delivered the WRONG dress. When I communicated with them via online chat, I agreed in getting a replacement instead of a refund. I was told that I would receive the correct dress in 3 days. Now, over a week later, I still have not received the dress! When I communicated them via online chat, they told me they JUST placed the order. Over a week after they told me it would arrive, they had barely placed the order! And they said all they could do was apologize. They NEVER made up for their mistake in ANY WAY. Not for sending the wrong dress, and not for lying about the delivery date! I bought this as a bridesmaid dress, and now I'm afraid I won't get the dress on time for the wedding, but everyone else has already gotten the same dress so I have no choice but to wait! And they couldn't even promise fast shipping to atone for THEIR mistake! Stay away from ASOS!"
"October 18, 2016",1,"Bad customer support, bad purchase experience","I had a terrible shopping experience on Asos.com on 10/17 and 10/18.On 10/17 I placed a order for $222.56. I purchased 2-day shipping for a year. I used a promotion code I received which gave me 15% off my order. I did not receive as confirmation email. On 10/18, I logged into my Asos.com account and saw the order was now in status: ""Order Unsuccessful""I used your online chat to speak to an agent named Conor.Conor informed my that the reason my order was unsuccessful was because my card was declined.1. My credit card was not declined. I called my bank and confirmed with them you removed the money form my account and then put it back. 2. You did not notify me that my order was cancelled. I had to reach out to find out what was going on.3. Conor was very rude and not apologetic. He logged out without thanking me for my time or saying goodbye.On 10/18, I attempted to redo my order. I was very sad to see the dress I purchased for my best friends wedding was sold out in my size I ordered it in a different size to see if it would fit. I applied the same promo to my order. My promo code was denied for reason: ""You've already used this promo code""I once again reached out via your online chat.I was told that an advanced specialist would need to look into my issue with the promo code which could take 24-48 hours. They refused to give me a new promo code to use. I don't have 24-48 hours because I'm worried the other dresses will sell out. I placed the order at full price. I did not buy 2-day shipping, this time I used EXPRESSUSA for shipping.I was told that once I purchased it, there will be nothing you can do about the money.The way I see it, I am owed a 15% discount. You also need feedback to improve your buying system. I should not be responsible with tracking down what happened to my order. My credit card was NOT declined so I don't know why it's saying it is in your system. Something is broken or someone is wrong. It shouldn't take 12 hours for me to find out that my card was declined. I lost out on a dress I wanted to wear because of this situation."
"October 18, 2016",1,"Customer service useless, Hermes delivery a joke","I recently ordered some new clothes from ASOS. They were apparently delivered today. Where they were delivered I do not know, the delivery company wont speak to me. After contacting ASOS for assistance, they could not find any trace of my account or order, despite taking my money! They have now just ended a call with me because they could not find my details and told me Technical would email me in due course once they found the details. How long will this take? Where is my order? How can you take my money if you have no trace of my account or order? Useless, never again!"
"October 15, 2016",5,Never had a single issue,"I shop on Asos most months and have literally never had a problem. Fast (and free!) delivery, easiest returns process ever, generally great quality clothes & a really easy to navigate website. Love the 'see it on a catwalk' feature and the fact you can save to a wish list. Only improvement would be having a ratings option like Topshop.com does so that people could give feedback on products, fabrics, fit etc.Also its strange that when you refine your search you can't easily unselect ranges like maternity, tall, plus-size etc from showing up. Unless you actually are pregnant, tall or plus sized you're not ever going to buy those ranges."
"October 15, 2016",1,"Customer service awful, Hermes delivery a joke","After ordering and paying £9.95 for ASOS Premier delivery my item did not arrive the next day. But the day after it should have arrived my tracking suddenly changed to received. Having contacted ASOS over this I was told to 'check my address was correct' and 'see if it has been left with any neighbours' despite there being people in when my order was supposedly delivered and no card out through the door. ASOS customer services promise to get back in touch with you but they do not. I had to messaged them five times over a week just to find out what they are doing about this issue. After messaging them again today a week after I placed the order they once again said they will look into it and get back to me. I then get another email stating that they are sorry but they are unable to locate my order, and that they had refunded the item since it is now out of stock. So I've payed for premier delivery which is beyond pointless since I don't receive my orders because they choose to deliver through Hermes which as most people know is an awful delivery service as drivers often 'lose' packages which is ironic considering they said they had delivered mine."
"October 14, 2016",1,Late delivery,Still waiting for a delivery
"October 12, 2016",1,I regret ordering from them.,"Where do I start? Order not delivered, still waiting. Terrible customer service in that I just don't know how to reach them. Chat doesn't seem to be working. I don't know what to do but wait for something I thought was worth £16. Never again Asos."
"October 12, 2016",1,"Atrocious service, bad quality, constant screw ups","I've shopped with ASOS for years and made the mistake of paying for premier shipping, a product that is *meant* to give me free express shipping and returns. Well, ASOS failed to send a single order via express and when I tried to address the issue, claimed all sorts of nonsense including flat out lying and saying I had received it when I hadn't, and they're refusing to refund me. I guess scamming a customer out of $40 is more important than not screwing them over and having them continue shopping with ASOS for years to come. ASOS customer service are rude incompetent, and refuse to address the numerous problems that come with their products. Avoid like the plague"
"October 12, 2016",2,Overpriced,Some of their stuff is mad overpriced like I bought these tights for £6 and obviously that's my fault but honestly I thought they'd at least be better quality and maybe more than one pair? I ain't rich bih ... also these shoes I ordered came and they had a huge scratch near the heel?? Tf 🤔
"October 12, 2016",1,Crappy customer service,"I was recommended to find my birthday dress on this site. Found the perfect 2, ordered it, paid for expedited shipping so it would make it in time for my flight. The next day at 6pm I received an email saying my order was cancelled, I was blocked from using my app, and they needed my personal info (identification, bank statement with address, and my card number with the last 4 digits showing, etc.) I sent all requested info. The customer service is non existent. I used the customer service chat the rep told me I'd receive a call the next day. Even though I expressed the urgency, I still didn't receive a call. I emailed customer service, expressed urgency and asked how long the process was, they completely ignored my question and basically to me to wait. Still no call. I had to use a friend's account to order!! It has been over a week! Customer service still hasn't contacted me and I'm still blocked out of my app. Who in hell did I send my personal info to?!!It's ironic how ASOS.com can still send me hella emails to buy but I can't place any orders!"
"October 11, 2016",1,Ups sucks and hidden extra costs!!!,"there was an extra cost of 35 dollars even after paying for premium shipping and there is no way for me to claim the package unless I am home and have a cheque ready payable to asos which I only found out after getting the delivery slip. I tried to schedule a delivery time with ups but after putting me on hold for an hour, they said there was nothing they could do about delivery time and gave me a 12 hour window for when it would arrive."
"October 11, 2016",2,trash tracking system,"i ordered stuff a few days ago and they never sent me a tracking number. Instead they emailed me a link to track my order and when i go to said link, it send me to a page that just says, ""Your ASOS order will be with you soon."" Thats it. Thats all it says. its been almost a week and nothing."
"October 10, 2016",1,Mortified and disgusted,"I placed an order with ASOS back in September 2016. My order was for Adidas T-shirt and Adidas leggings.  It is important to note that I have been in an ASOS customer for over five years, with no issues and have always been pleased. Back to this particular order, I received the order and when I opened it,  I was horrified to find that there were bugs inside of my packaging. Now in a state of shock, I disposed of the items  and went straight to Google for a customer service number. It is also important to note that in my five years of being a customer I have never had to call their phone number, so I was unaware that they only resolve issues via email or chat.  When I reached out to a customer service representative, I was assured  that a team member would be responding to me within 48 hours. Within the 48 hours I was notified that my account had been closed and they were not able to disclose the information as to why. I am extremely  disappointed in the lack of customer service I received and the way my item was shipped to me. It was as if they wanted me to take the blame for the issues and my items. Now, I am out of almost $100 because they will not refund me for the item and I can no longer purchase anything from the site for a reason unbenounced to me. I am out of almost $100 because they will not refund me for the item and I can no longer purchase anything from ASOS site for a reasons unbenounced to me.  I never thought this type of humiliation would come from a clothing company, but it has. ASOS, you should be ashamed."

"October 10, 2016",5,Never had a problem - I love Asos,"I order from ASOS at least 2 times every month. For me it is easy to ""Save items for later"", review the items, click them home - and if something doesn't fit/suit me, I can return it for free just by printing a label. I rarely shop in physical shops anymore. I LOVE ASOS :)"
"October 10, 2016",1,Bad experience!,I placed an order on Friday 7th October 2016 and paid for nect day delivery (Saturday) but on Saturday I did not receive the items so I gave customer service a call and they advised me that ASOS do not deliver on a weekend and that I would have the item by Monday 10th of the latest. Today is Monday and I still have not received the items so I called customer service again to only be told that the items have not even left the warehouse yet and that they will have another one sent out to me but it will take up to 48hours! I have explained to the agent that I go away tomorrow hence I placed the order on Friday but it just seems as though no one cares and just expect me to either pay again for the same items to be sent to me or to just leave it as that and wait until later on this week for the original items to be sent to me! I am not a happy customer and I usually leave good reviews but on this occasion I have to be honest and voice my opinion. After reading all of these reviews it just proves that this company continuously mess people about. I now have to prospone my flight until next week Monday as I will be gone for 6 months but because of this mistake I have to wait an extra week. One things for sure I will never be ordering for ASOS again!
"October 08, 2016",5,my account is blocked for no reason . Please help,"I love it !! i love Asos , but they blocked my account for no reason . i am so upset"
"October 06, 2016",1,The other reviews are true...,I have bought from Asos for YEARS and never had any issue until now. My package got lost in the mail so I contacted UPS who told me that it was lost and to get Asos to refund me or resend the items. Upon reaching out to Asos they told me to contact UPS...I was responding back and forth and they accused me of putting the wrong address (which I had gotten packages shipped to before and was stored in their system). Every response said let me check into it and they would take days to get back...all automated messages. I even got the same message twice!!! It's a shame cause they have cute stuff and good brands...something must have happened with the company.
"October 06, 2016",1,ASOS LOST PARCEL Trick beware!!,"International free shipping is non existing they provide no tracking number. You never receive your package and their customer service is terrible and rude Lost over $1000 usd in merchandise that never arrived. They blocked me from twitter and my own account.These people are tricksters!!  please BEWARE do not buy from them. Their twitter page is flooded daily with complaints from ppl not recieving their parcels. Had to claim through PayPal this is a nightmare!Then they will threaten and treat you like an idiot And if you try to speak up through social media they will completely block you from their pages !  This is like living in a dictatorship, it is actually a disgrace ASOS you make online shopping stressful unreliable and unworthy. Your representatives are disrespectful robots that hide behind computer screens and treat people like toilet seats ! The quality is really bad and just not worth the value I wonder how much money they pay bloggers to make their company look cool and reliable? Please do not let ASOS trick you!!!!  there are plenty of honest decent retail websites everywhere You for sure will be told off and insulted"
"October 05, 2016",1,Keep track of your own returns- don't expect a refund,"***WORTH READING: Even if you like the clothes.. have you ever noticed that pretty much every single female model, whether she's 5'7 or 5'10, wears the same size (XS, US 4, 26, EU 8...).  It's just not true and it makes figuring out your own size impossible.  Unless you're clairvoyant, expect to need to return things often.***They say ""free returns"" but somehow they don't know if you return something to them until you remind them that they owe you money.They don't reply to customer care emails unless you threaten to dispute credit charges.They lie and tell you that refunds are coming.You will never speak to the same customer service rep via email because every email they send has a different ridiculous fake name.I've received replies from 4 names (that I can remember) since mid September.  Notice the theme among other reviews of Asos telling you to wait longer and longer for your money.  Not only do I regret my purchase, I regret sending the item back for no reason.  I feel like I just gave them free money.If you try to reach them on social media, they block you, lie, and tell you to message them privately.  They don't answer private messages, they just do that to save face.  They essentially mute you and pretend that they're doing the right thing.The clothing is less than average quality in Europe-  they get by by keeping nice looking items in low supply and presenting them to American consumers at a jacked up price.Save yourself the headache."
"October 05, 2016",1,ASOS IS A SCAM AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NON EXISTENT,"I ordered a top from this website and the was scheduled for delivery in 4 days. Its been 2 whole weeks and i havent received my order and the DUMB! customer services always send me thesame DUMB message. Highly DISAPPOINTED!Thanks for getting in touch about your ASOS order 228007768.I'm really sorry to hear that you're yet to receive your ASOS Muscle Fit Turtle Neck Jumper in Cotton, I can assure you this is not the norm here at ASOS and I'm sorry that we've let you down on this occasion.Please rest assure as I can definitely help! As there isn't a tracking number available for this order, we can't see its current location. However, your local Post Office may be able to look into this if you contact them directly. I've checked and can see your order is being delivered by your local postal service and was due to arrive by 29th September 2016 on order confirmation.In case there are any postal delays in your area please wait until 6th October 2016 for your order to arrive."
"October 04, 2016",1,horrible customer service will never purchase again,"they have no phone number associated with the company where you can call.  second they make it very difficult to return the items.  watch out for the label tracking number.  the tracking number on the label provided is NOT for USPS it is their own tracking system.  the customer service reps are clueless when it comes to returns.  apparently they take 11 days to return a simple merchandise.  I would simply just order from Amazon, it is so much easier.  the customer service reps should at least know when the items were received and they act as if they have no idea when the shipment was returned.  they take apparently 11 days to return the items and then take another few days to process the credit cards."
"October 03, 2016",2,Refunding,"This past summer I ordered a swimsuit for when I go on vacation. It was a really nice swimsuit with a mesh top and high waisted bottoms I was really excited to get it. I had ordered it with standard business shipping, it came on time,but the problem was that the top was the wrong size. I proceeded to contact asos customer service by sending them an e-mail, I waited for 2 days but still no reply. After the 2 days I sent them another e-mail and waited another 2 days still no reply. So I saw online saying that you can contact them through twitter so I did that. Within the next day someone replied,  I told them I would be going on vacation in less than 4 days so I would like get the swim top asap. So the order was processed and I received my swimsuit top and within two days. Unfortunately again they sent me the wrong size as well as the top was a completely different from what I ordered. By that time it was too late to order another top, because I have to go on vacation. After I came back from vacation I sent both tops and bottom back for refund. I was told to wait a 5 to 10 business days for a refund,and I would receive an email from the warehouse thing that a package was received. I returned the products on August 24th and received partial refund on September 1st for the bikini bottoms and not the top. So I contacted Asos and told them the situation about me receiving only partial refund. I was told once again that I would have to wait 7 for returns to process. I was confused as to why I received half every fund if both products were inside the same package. So I contacted them and they said that my they would look into it. They said that my replacement didn't reach your house yet and that I had to wait until September 8th and then contact them again. So I contacted them on September 9th and because I still didn't receive my full refund. They said they would have their Specialist Team look into the problem andvwait another 48 hours. The problem was finally resolved and I finally received my refund 15 days later. I never had a problems with ASOS before, but after this experince I definitely won't be buying any products from them anytime soon."
"October 03, 2016",5,One of My top 5 shops!,"I honesty shop here once a month. I love their sales and codes are brilliant.The wish list is great for keeping stuff you wanna wait for codes for.Their returns are really fast and free!They deliver very fast to Ireland...free over an amount or pay for faster delivery.I just wish they had reviews on items on their website so you knew how the garment was with other buyers, fit, fabric etc. And of course their prices are brilliant for high end fashion which is most important!"
"October 03, 2016",5,Fantastic webshop,"I bought a pair of pants which didn't fit me, and there were no problems when I wanted to return the. Thumbs up!!"
"October 03, 2016",5,Amazing fast shopping,"Asos is a very good place to shop, have almost everything and the shopping is fast. But the pants I buy, didn't fit my as good as the model, so returned them."
"October 03, 2016",5,Loving the clothes!,"Some days ago I brought some clothes from Asos, within very few days my package came. No problem, on time and everything was in the right sizes. I really do not understand these bad reviews on Asos.-Will definitely buy again! x"
"October 02, 2016",2,Blind customer service,"I bought a lovely dress for my prom, received it quickly and in good shape. But I noticed that the top part of my dress and also sleeves (all made of lace) was made of a different kind of lace than the one they showed on their website. The ""edge"" of the sleeves were also ""cut"" differently than on the website pictures. I'm not a picky person and still liked the dress, but it was clear to see the difference between my dress and the pictures on the website. So I took a picture of me in my dress. In a collage, I put my picture next to ASOS' picture, so it was clear to see the difference between what the website was claiming to sell and what I'd actually received. This I sent to the ASOS customer service. I got a message back, about a week later, telling me that they couldn't see any difference. Bull...Sadly trustpilot won't allow me to link the collage I made, but the difference was clear! So watch out for what you order - your product might not look exactly like the one online! Scam."
"September 30, 2016",1,Absolutely Atrocious. Waste of time and money.,"I ordered pajamas and slippers from there and I always track my packages online. I was given a four day delivery, it ended up getting here 5 days late. So, four days passed, no package, 5 days past again, no package. I finally get my items and it's all just wrong. I ordered a tall pajamas and I must've gotten short because they were so incredibly small. I'm not giant enough that I don't fit into normal people's clothing either. Instead of sending me tall specified product they sent me one for not normal height people, but shorter people. I also ordered slippers. The sippers were 5/6 when I ordered 7/8. I was disappointed but not extremely let down because my feet can still fit in 5/6 because i'm size 6-6 1/2 it's just not as comfortable. Well, my little remaining hope of satisfaction was shredded yesterday when my slippers ripped. Not even a month of having them, probably wearing them all of 5 times, the fabric has come apart. The worst part is that this wasn't cheap stuff. It was over 40.00. I have been trying to communicate with customer service but if their customer service operates like their shipping and delivering and quality control I'm probably going to be stuck with wasted money and crappy quality clothes and broken slippers. DO NOT SHOP HERE. Just go to Target."
"September 30, 2016",2,Appalling customer service,"Let me start this review by saying that I have ordered from ASOS countless times in the past and have rarely had a problem. When I have had an issue such as an item missing, they've quickly resolved it.However, recently I have noticed that their ""next day delivery"" service is nothing of the sort. I have placed several orders before the cut-off time and yet they have not been delivered the next day.Most recently, I placed an order on a Tuesday evening and it was not in fact delivered until the Friday, with no explanation. Then, I discovered that 3 of my 6 items were missing from the parcel. The parcel had been clearly opened and resealed with DPD tape, so I was willing to let this go as an issue with the delivery company rather than ASOS.However, my experience trying to resolve the issue with the missing items has been catastrophic. When reporting the missing items via the ASOS website, you can only report one item at a time so I had to send three separate emails and I got three separate replies detailing what to do. I thought the best thing to do would be to copy and paste these responses into one email, explain what had happened and send this to ASOS customer care.Now, one person handling one of the missing items immediately sent the item out, whereas the other two hesitated and asked for more info. By the time I had received a reply saying they were looking into the issue with DPD delivery (and would reply within 48 hours), I knew the two remaining items wouldn't arrive before I moved away for uni, so I clearly requested to be refunded for these two items. In my next reply from ASOS I was told I had been refunded for one of the items, but there was no mention of the other.I politely replied saying I still needed a refund for the final item, and 24 hours later received a reply from ASOS saying they'd have to pass this issue onto the specialist team and they would get back to me within 48 hours, despite the fact that this issue has already been fully investigated. I have now replied detailing this and expressing that I require a refund immediately.It has now been 10 days since I placed my order and a week since I started my complaints and my issues have still not been fully resolved, resulting in a delay in having the money returned to my account.I have now realised that the issue with the customer service is that every time you email them, a different person replies so there isn't one person handling your problem: it's being passed around the department. For a problem as complex as mine has become, this is making it near impossible for it to be solved. In the future I will seriously hesitate before ordering anything from ASOS again. This experience has dragged on for far too long and left me infuriated and around £100 out of pocket."
"September 30, 2016",5,Decent,"Used them a number of times, no problems with service and delivery. Had a slight issue with a faulty pair of hair straighteners but had a free returns label and was refunded very quickly Would recommend."
"September 30, 2016",2,Laughable,"I've generally never had much of an issue with ASOS before, sometimes sizes are a bit bigger than expected but such is life. However I ordered a red military style jacket which arrived baby pink. Upon trying to find some answers from customer service, they told me it was just the lighting in which the jacket was being viewed. Now I don't know what what lighting they use but it must be a miracle to turn baby pink into red. Made to feel like I was an idiot, not impressed ASOS."
"September 28, 2016",1,Was not deliveed on time!,"ASOS sent me an email stating that my package would arrive on or before Wednesday, it has not! and they didn't even notify me or offer compensation when i complained! and before i could even answer her question on live chat....she deleted the conversation as apparently i was finished talking with her!Thanks a lot Tania. and no, to answer an earlier question by her, i am not happy with this service!!!!"
"September 28, 2016",1,HAVE FUN!!!,"Here's the thing about ASOS, even if it is their fault if you don't get the correct order, even if you order something and you NEVER receive it, they DON'T OFFER YOU A COUPON FOR A FUTURE ORDER. Like why should I even have to ask for one? I've had two issues with them within the past year. The first incident I ordered a purse that I never received. When contacting them I got the run around a million times, in the meantime while all this is happening the purse sells out online so I can't even have it replaced. After about 8 email exchanges back and forth, getting no where, being told I would refunded, it was then I contacted asos online to practically BEG them for a coupon code, because nothing had really been resolved and this entire issue was a mistake on their part not mine. They give me a promo for 15 percent off...WOW ALL THIS CRAP AND I GET 15% OFF?! WHAT A DEAL. Not. Anyway I never use it, flash forward almost another year and I order off their website again, clearly haven't learned my own lesson from dealing with them. I order a dress, receive it in about 4 days, and WHAT DO YOU KNOW?! IT'S THE WRONG ITEM. Wrong color, size, BRAND, item code, etc. Like someone just grabbed the first dress they found and shipped it out to me. So I contact Asos telling them how infuriated I am, having another issue with them. I tried to see if I could just order another one, but SURPRISE! In the time it took for me to receive this dress I never asked for, the dress I actually had ordered is SOLD OUT IN MY SIZE. So I contact them. They take two days to respond to me. When I get a follow up email it says that they have arranged a replacement to be sent to me, subject to order availability, and for me to send back within 28 days the dress I had received. Well I wait 2 days, in the meantime checking the site to view the stock in a US size 4. In those 2 days I waited to hear back, I witnessed the dress come back in stock, leave in stock, and come back into stock a HAND FULL of times. But I waited because they said they were sending me the replacement. I also forgot to mention that I had specified after the initial email I was sent that if a size 4 were no longer available that I would take a size 2. WELL I just received an email today saying that they are re crediting my account because the item is sold out. WOW. So I go on the site, and WHAT DO YOU KNOW the size 4 is sold out BUT they have a size 2 in stock. Guess they just didn't care to follow any guidance in my email requesting they send the 2 as backup. And not ONCE through any of this was I offered a DECENT coupon by any employee for an inconvenience that was all their fault. So yea. Have fun shopping with them if you have any issues that arise with this company."
"September 28, 2016",4,Okay service but incorrect order.,"Service from the company is okay, the order was processed within 2 days and shipped, delivered to my courier's address within a few days. The quality of the items was very good and as seen on the website, however one item I ordered was swapped with something similar (I ordered a red criss cross bikini and got a different style bikini of the same colour). The item is nice, but it isn't what I ordered. I won't return it because its too much of a hustle (I live in Zambia)."
"September 28, 2016",1,Poor shipment,"I have not received my package. i have contacted them twice and they say they will look into it and get back within 48 hours. I never heard back. One other time I ordered, the package was not in a sterdy box, it was lousy and flimsy, it also so happened that someone opened it and took out some of my make up. I only got 2 of the 3 ordered items. The packing of the shipment is really cheap. Really unhappy and will not ever order again."
"September 27, 2016",2,"Average, bad, worse, then straight up awful","So I've ordered from ASOS on 5 different occasions, all within the same two month period. My first order arrived a month after it was supposed to. My fourth order arrived a week after I'd sent for it. Then another two packages went missing and they had to be re-sent. Seems as though ASOS will do their utmost to make it so they don't have to return the money. I requested a refund on the missing packages multiple times and was ignored and the packages were instead sent back to me against my wishes (I was about to leave the country and the address they were sending to would no longer be able to give my packages). This fifth package has only just been sent out, but considering they could barely manage sending things to a US post office I doubt they'll be able to manage anything in Asia."
"September 27, 2016",2,"Awful own brand, fast shipment.","The items are always shipped on time, packaged well and im provided full tracking of my parcel, the other brands they carry are great but stay away from their own brand. I have ordered over 10 items from their own brand across 2 separate occasion and each time i had to return them because the quality was so poor. For your own good, stick to the other brands they carry."
"September 26, 2016",5,Extremely satisfied,"I am not sure what's up with all the negative reviews because I've had quite the opposite experience. Ordered a bomber jacket for 130$ CAD, was supposed to be delivered on the 28th but actually came 2 days earlier on the 26th. Was able to track the package with no problems. The quality and colours of the product are wonderful, and true to size. Did not get charged at all for duties (I'm from Ontario, CA). Overall great experience and very happy with my purchase."
"September 26, 2016",1,My order never arrived on time. Plus I had no tracking#.,"My order never arrived on time. I never got any updates, where my order was, nothing. I emailed customer service and all they had to say was just wait a few more days. I never received a tracking number. Every company has to send one with your order. I just had a horrible experience. My order arrived, but late. I emailed asos again, I never got a response from them. Last time I ever buy."
"September 24, 2016",1,Very disappointing...,"Ordered jumper hoping to wear it for an occasion over the weekend and received a hangover cap!!!!! Now got to spend my time and petrol to return it back.. Spoke to customer services via chat online, was not offered any kind of compensation such as some, even little, discount voucher for further purchase or anything like that.. wouldnt be buying from them any time soon. There are more reliable sites around, with better customer care.."
"September 23, 2016",1,"Very bad, ordered 2 times, 2 times there were wrong items in the shipment.","It is unaccetable that in 2 orders both were WRONG ITEMS that i did not ORDER or WRONG SIZE.In about 10 years of buying from the web, its the first time i find such incompetent shop."
"September 23, 2016",5,Been a customer for two-three years.,"OVERALLOver the past two to three years I have been an avid customer ordering at least two or three orders a month from shirts to pants. And I can honestly say I have had no issues other than sizing which sometimes run a tad bit small, but as far as returns I have had no issue as I just use the ASOS online return service.  From that, I would like to say that I have never needed to contact customer service because I just returned anything that did not fit me correctly.  As for sizing I can understand why the clothes run small as I am assuming the citizens of the UK and the age range who wears fashionable clothes tend to be a bit smaller than the normal American being I am pretty skinny for a guy my age. Also if you just look at their average model they tend to be on the skinny side so it's safe to assume ASOS clothes run a tad bit small or is more form fitting. As of end of 2016, ASOS has added a plus size section for both men and women, as well as, a Tall section and maternity section which was pre-existing and contains all a very numerous selection of clothing. Shipping to the USAOn another note when I first start purchasing stuff from ASOS I can genuinely say I hated their shipping mainly because of the price, but now I love it as they added two-day shipping for a year with a one-time payment of I believe ($20.00) as of (5/5/17). And if you shop at ASOS in the USA or anywhere to be honest this luxury can be invaluable. If you live in the USA know that your order from ASOS will most likely ship from Great Britain. So  two day shipping may take between (2 1/2 days) or (3)but is very unlikely to be three days and I have only had one instance of a package taking three days and it was due to bad weather. Now about the quality I believe you get what at you paid for as well as a good product, now knowing that sometimes in regards to their sweet shirts they do seem a tad bit cheap but still look good.  To end this I believe that Asos is a great company that has a very large selection and is for those who wish to be inn all the latest trends and who don't mind paying good money for good products as well as cheaper products that are fashionable and will last if they are taken care of properly. -----Side note I recommend you use Paypal when buying from them it makes it simple and will prevent any issues with billing other commenters have mentioned."
"September 21, 2016",1,Dont ever order from asos.com! Horrible service,"I ordered two wedding cocktail dresses on sunday night, had them shipped for next day delivery, was supposed to get here tuesday, no sign , nothing, no email.. Had to email myself customer service, turned out my account has been blocked for some reason..and its taking them 2 days to figure it out.. Still no dress.. Tried chatting with them online.. Didnt go anywhere, but later received a weird email stating they cancelled my whole order, as to why didn't state.. Im beyond shocked and mad!! Never had i had this kind of level of service before.. Now I'm going to wedding with not the dress i was wanting. Don't order from them, SCAM!!!!!"
"September 21, 2016",1,Do not waste your money on next day delivery,"Asos used to be great but now that they are online giants, their customer service and reliability is non existent. I purchased Premier next day delivery for £9.99 for a whole year and have had an issue with delivery times on every single order which I have placed. You place an order, get all information from asos stating your delivery will be with you the next day as you expect and then on your delivery day, you get that you won't be getting your delivery until the following day. Questioning this with customer services is a joke. Asos simply cannot deliver reliably which in this day and age and with such other good companies around who offer a water tight next day option, is just unacceptable."
"September 21, 2016",1,Items Missing. Asos Said Im a Liar.,Had to initiate a chageback.
"September 21, 2016",2,Sizes are WAY off,"I had heard REALLY mixed reviews about ASOS and had sworn I would never risk it, but I was desperate for a dress to wear to a wedding and fell in love with one on their site. I looked at the size chart, and found their measurements provided were about accurate to my usual size, so I purchased the size 0 (the size I ALWAYS wear). The dress came, and the material felt cheaper than expected for a $90 dress, but what can you do? I loved the colors and the print, so I was really pleased... until I put it on. The size 0 fit more like a size 6. There is absolutely NO way a person who wears a size 0 would look good in it. It was so wide I looked like I was wearing a potato sack, but the sleeves were so tight they wouldn't have been comfortable if they had been even the tiniest bit smaller. Since I was running out of options and time to find something for the wedding, I decided I would keep it and just have it taken in because I really did like the  print and style and the way it SHOULD have looked. The problem is, I took it to the tailor to have the alterations made, and because the way the material was draped, it was going to require way more work than I had anticipated. At this point, I was totally screwed if I didn't get this dress fixed, so I had to pay the $70 to have it taken in. SEVENTY DOLLARS!!!!!!! THAT is how off the size was!! I was told by their customer service that their size chart was just a general guide (thanks for sharing the obvious, ASOS) and that the actual size of the item would vary based on style, material, etc. While I totally understand that, there is no reason why the smallest size offered in an item should be 3 sizes too big. That is completely unreasonable. Honestly, lower the prices or fix your sizes. I had wanted to spend less than $100 for a dress to wear to this wedding, and ended up spending $160 in the end because I had to fix something that should not have needed so much work. In most situations, I would have no problem spending $160 on a dress I loved, that fit, and I would wear again. I would never spend that much when the dress requires so much work and alterations just to be the item I had originally thought I was purchasing. Needless to say, I will not resort to ordering from ASOS ever again, no matter how desperate I am. I am only giving two sizes because the dresses print and style (AFTER it was fixed - the way it should've looked from the start) were actually really cute and I got a lot of compliments."
"September 20, 2016",1,Unpleasant Experience,"I ordered two dresses for my baby shower this weekend and ordered them far enough in advance to make sure they were delivered today (3 days before the weekend).  My package did not get delivered, you cannot call and speak to anyone and I was told it would take 48 hours for someone to investigate and get back to me.  I asked if they could please next day me a new order (my card was already charged $82) and I was told there was nothing they could do from their end.  The only solution was to refund me the $82 (which takes 5-10 business days) and then place a new order online and I would have to pay for next day shipping, they wouldn't cover it for me even though I originally placed my order in more than enough time to get the dresses when I needed them.  This is not how you take care of a customer and make them want to shop on your site again!"
"September 20, 2016",5,Great Service,Item was ordered at 9.55pm & was delivered the next day by DPD. The item was delivered on time & I was sent a text message with a time slot on.
"September 19, 2016",1,what a joke,"I ordered a pair of shoes off ASOS and they hadn't arrived after a few weeks. I checked the tracking only to see that the status says attempted to be delivered a week earlier but had not been updated since. I contacted the customer service team to find out where the order was and they advised they would investigate and be in touch with me within 2 business days. I hadnt heard anything after three business days so i contacted them again to question where the parcel was.They then responded and advised that the address it had gone to had South Australia in it, but that they had the correct Victorian address.They then proceed to tell me that they could not send it back out to me again, and i had to wait for up to another 10 working days for them to receive the parcel back at the warehouse, after which they would then have to refund me, and if i still wanted the shoes i would have to go to the website and purchase them again.I responded to them saying i wasn't happy with this option as it was in no way my fault that it was attempted to be delivered to the wrong state, but they weren't willing to provide any alternative options.I wont be re-ordering with ASOS after this joke of a customer experience. I also find it funny that its very difficult to leave any reviews of ASOS, including their Facebook page, which leads me to believe their appalling customer service is standard."
"September 18, 2016",5,pure love!,I love Asos! I buy most of my clothes there! great  and fast service
"September 17, 2016",4,Happy with my order,Good experience. Great products!!! Love my dresses
"September 16, 2016",2,Poor Resolution,"Spend a lot of money with Asos ( well a lot of money to me ). I have Asos A list level 3. Normally I have no problems with my orders but disappointed with how slow they are to resolve an issue when you do have a problem. I sent back a ring to exchange which they didn't do , I then had to chase it with a number of emails. They then agreed to send on a next day delivery but they sent it to the delivery collection address which is a local Spa . Spa keep refusing it and I keep getting updates from DPD advising it has been refused . Asos have still not replied to my emails to change the address as I cannot change it with DPD they have to . Still not resolved as I write this . Disappointed customer ."
"September 13, 2016",2,Payment Review.,When getting my refund it wasn't done straight away and got refunded for the wrong item and didn't get payed the right amount! This has happened to someone I know also and took nearly SIX WEEKS to actually go back in there bank acc. Poor experience with this.
"September 13, 2016",5,Great service!,I always get great service from Asos. Quick delivery and easy returning!
"September 13, 2016",1,This is the worst company ever!,They did not put the street address on my order. These idiots only put the city and state and the zip code. I'm furious. I needed this dress for a wedding and now it is in route back to Asos. they refuse to have another dress shipped out to me even though my original order. There is no 800 number to call only a live chat and those people on the other end are careless and rude. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM EVER!!! YOU WILL BE EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.
"September 13, 2016",1,Complete and utter joke of a company,"I've given up buying from Asos now. From own-brand items that disintegrate in the wash after one spin, lost parcels, lost deliveries, paying for next day delivery and getting it 3 days later - nobody in their office seems to know what's going on. Add to that their rubbish returns service (two of my items I was accused of not returning them, despite having the proof). Seriously, Asos - you need to get your act together. Absolutely crap."
"September 11, 2016",1,Customer service is beyond awful.,"ansoluley sick and tired trying to get in touch with these lot, ignore your messeges unless you post on their wall on social media, my previous order was a nightmare to get in touch with them, asked them for a phone call so many times but they kept asking for order number which clearly I gave so many times, seems like they're just time passing trying to avoid my query- I've just placed another order for next day delivery, I need this for eid which is tomorrow and I'm running out of patience trying to get in contact with someone but no luck! Received no despatch email or anything, Where is my parcel?! Absolutely shocked at your service!!! Will not recommend to anyone."
"September 09, 2016",1,"They threatened to ban me for keeping correct item, wrong color","I ordered a skirt from Asos in a polka dot color and they sent me the black one instead. The black skirt was about $17 cheaper than the polka dot one. By the time I received the item both the black and polka dot skirts were sold out. Instead of offering me a refund for the difference in price, they said I had to return the skirt, and if I didn't, they would ban me from future purchases. I talked to different customer service people and they all said the same thing-- it doesn't matter if I still like the black skirt, I have to return it or else their stock will be messed up. I took screen shots of all our conversations because I couldn't believe it. They were basically calling me a thief for wanting to keep the skirt even though I paid more than what that colored skirt is worth. Their returns page said refunds are up to their discretion so basically, after insulting and threatening me, it turns out they could have issued me a refund and let me keep the skirt, they just didn't feel like it. I've spent almost $1000 at Asos in the past two years but never again. I used to tell my friends to shop there but now I will tell anyone who will listen not to shop at Asos, the most awful online clothing company in the history of the internet. They would get no stars if that were an option."
"September 09, 2016",1,Absolutely terrible - the last straw for me!,"I have bought several things from Asos and for the most part it has been alright. I've had issues with returns and stuff like that, but nothing this horrific. They lost my package - delivered it to a different town, to a different name and when I contacted customer service they gave me generic answers. I asked ""what happens if I don't receive my order?"" and the rep could NOT give me a straight answer, she said ""let's not think like that..."" What the heck?! You tell your customer that if they don't receive the package you'll either resend the order or refund the money. The package is still misdelivered and who even knows how this will unfold. I won't be supporting them again."
"September 08, 2016",1,They lost my parcel,They lost my parcel and never come back to me just said was delivery to different address and that's all the worst side in Internet ...and customer service hire stiupid people
"September 08, 2016",1,THE WORST,I bought some cute socks from ASOS for our bridal party and they never came.... I'm very frustrated as we needed them promptly and then when I had a 30 minute conversation with their chat service she basically told me to ask my neighbors and post office. We get so many packages delivered to our house and have never had issues. We also usually get a tracking code etc. and never got anything to confirm when it was coming. Thank God I only spent $20.00 and didn't purchase anything else.
"September 08, 2016",1,SUPERVISORS LIE AND AVOID CUSTOMERS!,"had an hour log chat with ""scott"" about a credit that hasnt yet posted to my acct.  not only did he evade my questions with generic answers, but was very curt and utterly useless in providing any kind of clear answers and professional customer service.basically he said they dont do followups on calls and when i thought providing him the name of the rep who i originally spoke to would help, he said that wouldnt help because there are a few agents with the name ""calvin!"". i then asked to speak with a supervisor, but no can do!  i even tried to help him find out who the acting supervisor was that gave calvin the approval to credit me on my order by telling him the time and date that we spoke, which was 4am, but he wouldnt even do that.  he said they dont do follow ups on calls!what kind of customer service is this?  he said he had to end call because he couldnt help me any longer!  he said he would forward message but thats all he could do...his supervisor just avoided me alll together.  no resolution.  no accountability."
"September 07, 2016",1,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER,"I have been trying to contact ASOS for the past 2 weeks now since they cancelled my order, I have been back and forth with them regarding getting my account back up to scratch since they cancelled my order, I have made it very very clear in my email and have sent them the relevant document they have asked for but they keep requesting the same information again agian and again the customer services team are very very incompetent, It is by far the worst company I have ever dealt with in my entire life..."
"September 07, 2016",1,Terrible,"This must be the worse customer service I have EVER had experience  dealing with and I have had some terrible ones. This is particularly the Dutch costumer service of ASOS. I have been trying for weeks to receive refunds to which I am entitled to also according to ASOS but it is just NOT happening. They are the most amature people I have ever encountered. Dozens of emails have passed and still nothing. In every e-mail I have to explain the looong story over and over again, but don't even think they bother to read properly or reply. Apart from the non exsistent customer service their products are of terrible quality. Sizes of the same brand (ASOS) can differ 2 or 3 sizes, it's just a gamble. Furthermore, often the wrong size is sent, products are often damages and/or poorly made. ASOS seriously needs to have a full make over if I ever even would consider placing another order. Shame on you ASOS for treating your paying customers so terrible!"
"September 07, 2016",2,Disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The sizes are not what they are shown on the website. And clothes does not look the same as they are shown in pictures.
"September 06, 2016",2,SSSR style customer service,"Never going to buy from ASOS ever again! If nothing goes wrong, then fair enough, I'm sure that they are fine. But if it does then tough luck getting anywhere.I ordered a piece of clothing for a party, time-sensitive so went for Next day delivery. It arrived on time but got delivered no one knows where. A random person signed for it and none of our next door neighbours knew anything about it. It then took a little while to find Customer Service details - not readily available on their website. Got it of internet search - 02077 561 000.When I called, the person on the other end just couldn't care less. I could tell how completely and utterly uninterested he is in the incompetence of a delivery firm they hire and in my predicament. ""72 hour investigation will be opened"", ""nothing can be done"". Not even an apology. At length, after asking again and again, he started checking with the courier. Said will get in contact and the package should be retrieved that day. This didn't happen. I had to call again the next day and do my worst ""customer from hell"" impression, full works including the best that British passive/aggressive sarcasm has to offer. Finally, managed to get out of them that the package was delivered somewhere 10 doors down for some strange reason (!). The courier was supposed to go there and retrieve after hours that day (which would have been too late). Once I had the location, I just went and got it myself. Luckily, these are neighbours that we get along great with and they get deliveries all day so the package was still there. Lucky break.I requested a refund or a compensation for all this stress and hassle and was told to forget it in so many words. ASOS just couldn't care less.This is actually the second time that this happened - they previously misplaced an order that I needed for a holiday, had to go without. They redelivered but it was after the fact.Fooled me once, fooled me twice ASOS, but no more! Not willing to endure Soviet Union style customer service again."
"September 06, 2016",3,Express shipping not worth it,"Ordered some items from asos about about a week ago with express shipping and it should have been here 4 days ago. However using Toll (in australia) is a mistake, it's a terrible service and never leaves parcels even in secure places, and then makes it incredibly difficult to find out where the package is and can be picked up from. I wont be able to get the parcel for two more days meaning I wasted my money on express shipping. Asos is a good company with good quality products but shipping processes need to be reconsidered."
"September 06, 2016",1,AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL,"Taken one month, 15 emails to receive nothing from Asos. Received a gift which was bought from Asos and broke Within several days. ASOS refused to do anything and said in an email that they ""can't magic up a replacement"" . They are rude, patronising and extremely unhelpful. Would give them 0 stars if I could."
"September 06, 2016",1,Never got my Refund,I purchased a pair of sneakers online and had to return them because they were too big. It's been almost a month and asos hasn't refunded my money! I've been calling customer service and it says that phone line doesn't work. I emailed them and they never got back to me! Horrible horrible! You can't play with people's money like that. Dont buy from this site! It's not trustworthy.
"September 05, 2016",5,Best customer service ever,"ASOS is the best! I dont know why everyone complain?! Come one, no company would refund you guys just like that, they have to check and that needs time 2, 3 or 4 days...Try zara or any other shop and you'll see what ""aweful"" means.  The only thing that disappointed me is, when i made an order and they were sending me a pair of jeans instead of the tshirt i wanted so bad. I contacted ASOS but unfortunately by then, the item was out of stock and i cant have my animal tshirt :-( buuuut still love asos!  ASOS I WISH I COULD GIVE YOU 10 stars because you and the customer service deserve itCheers"
"September 05, 2016",2,Horrible Delivery,"Unless you do next day delivery I would never recommend standard delivery. First off, it took 3 days for my item to be dispatched and another 3 days for it to come. Absolutely useless."
"September 05, 2016",1,Disgusting SERVICE and SCAM!,"Will never use asos again! Spent $1300 this morning now they're asking me personal information and want my drivers license and photos of my monthly utility bills. I've tried contacting them numerous times and all i get is 'please be patient we are passing it onto our specialist team"". Complete joke of a company! Will be taking this further! Eeveryone who reads this please report them to VISA and acorn.gov.au! The site will be removed and these people will be taken to prison as fraud isnt taken lightly !!"
"September 05, 2016",4,Great online shopping experience,"The ASOS own brand clothing can be a bit ropey, not the best quality but there are so many other brands on there, definitely spoilt for choice. In fact sometimes it's almost too much choice! Definitely can't fault the delivery service, always excellent, especially if you are a prime member, which is worth having. My go-to place when I'm stuck for something to wear and need it quick! Recommend."
"September 05, 2016",4,Not genuine package!!!,"I've made an order for a pair of Adidas Busenitz Trainers. All good, the order arrived in time even if my location is in East Europe. But I was surrpised when I saw the fact that the box was some cheap simple cartboard with no logo printed on it. I was pretty dissapointed cuz I always keep my footwear in the original box."
"September 05, 2016",5,Rapid delivery and good customer service,"Super quick delivery, amazing selection of products and refunds always quick and easy. Whenever I've got a query, Asos on Twitter always really helpful. Regularly use Asos due to these reasons."
"September 04, 2016",1,Horrible customer service,Package has yet to arrive ordered and charged 8/23 package sent 8/23 still has not arrived to my home. I will not order anything else from this company. The website for orders and tracking is very misleading save your money and order locally.
"September 03, 2016",1,2 Parcels didnt arrive and was told to keep waiting,Was told shipment for 2 parcels will arrive on 19 Aug and 24 Aug. Nothing came. Was told to wait till 6 sept till both parcels appear and refuse to refund me. Ridiculous and a cheater!!! Totally no customer service and fraud!
"September 03, 2016",1,"Absolutely disgraceful! Lack of contact, empty promises, no goods!","Placed an order for next day delivery, 12 days later, still shows order processing, contacted ASOS numeorous times, repeatedly get told this will be looked at asap, this will be looked at in 48 hours, 5 days later, still nothing. No goods and wont issue a refund, absolute joke of a company, AVOID!"
"September 02, 2016",1,Refunded part of my order but did not complete the rest...,"I ordered a few things at once. Cant remember how many items exactly but I basically requested a refund on the clothing part of the order, and an exchange for a smaller sized boot.It was all sent back at the same time, in the same packaging as that's how it came.I got the email saying that I had been refunded for the clothing so I got rid of receipt and thought cool, boots should be here soon.... Not so. After contacting them telling them the above (that I'm waiting on my boots in a smaller size) they ask for the damn receipt which i got rid of because I had confirmation they'd received the package due to the partial refund....They didn't give a D. That aside, their own brand clothing is very hit and miss- prob more miss. Other brands they stock seem to be on sale from those particular retailers, so do your research!!"
"September 02, 2016",5,Delivered two days after the order was made,"Every time I've shopped at ASOS, the delivery was quick and complete with no missing items. Just as it should be. Never had an issue."
"September 01, 2016",2,Late.....,"Bought an outfit from Asos using the 4 day delievery. It's been one week and when I called my local USPS they told me they haven't even received it yet. It would be at least a couple more days until they would get my package. If you don't have a timeline for when you need your clothes, maybe give them a try (my friends say they have had decent experiences) but don't bother if you need the package by a certain date. Should have listened to all the reviews that told me they take wayyyy longer than they say. Hoping the return process isn't as frustrating."
"September 01, 2016",3,Fast and uncomplicated refund,"This was my first experience with asos.com. I ordered 9 swimsuits of different sizes, as I didn't know, which size would fit me best. Whatever, I ordered in UK sizes 8 and 10 (36 & 38 in Germany) but had do return all of them, as the quality was extremely poor and not as pictured on their website! Also, even I suspected that 36 wouldn't fit me, I expected 38 to fit me well - but nope! Skintight and you could see through the fabric. The only positive aspect about this whole action was the fast and uncomplicated refund of my money. It took about 7-10 Days, which is quite quick in my opinion, as it takes longer with some other websites. But you have to be careful when returning swimsuits, as the hygiene-protect-sticker may not be removed!"
"August 31, 2016",3,They've sent me the wrong size,"Ordered some clothes from this website. Although I selected M size for all the clothes, two of them had some different sizes: one was L and another one was S. They accepted my return but I can't say it was a good experience."
"August 31, 2016",1,Zero stars actually,Sent me the wrong size by 5 sizes. I never got my refund back. Disgraceful.
"August 31, 2016",5,Seamless company,"I've been using Asos for years and I've never had any problems with them! Huge selection of clothing, great delivery prices, quick returns and speedy delivery :)"
"August 31, 2016",1,Fraud! Customer service is good with Taichi,"I been wanting to purchase their shoes or Trainers.  Bad history of purchase one but it was the size runs so big at 2 sizes big. Returning the shoes cost more than the shoes! Ridiculous. So I thought it would be helpful to consult the customer service. They never ever and gave lame response to my question about the exact measurement. Ya, Based on size chart obviously I know. If my purchase was a correct size based on the chart, I won't even ask! Deh... Giving excuses: the warehouse delay their responses. Or told me to go ahead and get free return. Pls why should I waste time buying something and it's incorrect? Looking at all the bad reviews really verified my doubts."
"August 31, 2016",5,Excellent service.,I orderd from asos twice. My last order was 5 days ago. The excepted delivery was in 2 weeks but it arrived in just 5 days super fast delivery and it was just standard delivery. Great quality and good prices. Best expirience overall! Recommended!!
"August 30, 2016",1,How Do They Get Away With This,"2yrs later I'm still waiting on a refund for a dress I returned that they NEVER received 2yrs later I still have proof of postage They were all nice at first said they'd look into it all online as u can't speak to anyone ?? Obviously works in their favour ?? Then after 6 emails they kidded on they couldn't understand me !! Honestly I Kidd u not !! Still can't believe it ?? Sent them in an email a pic of proof of return and then they Completly ignored me and have done for 2yrs now They should be ashamed of the way they get away with treating people like this They even removed my ""negative"" comment on their F/B page actually I think they might employ someone to immediately take neg comments down straight away prob with all the supposed non returns they DONT receive !! Beware of this company I spent hundreds of pounds with them at one point over 5yrs !!!!!!"
"August 30, 2016",5,Always amazing,I'm shocked this company doesn't have all 5 star reviews!! Been ordering from here for 3yeara and delivery always on time and refunds come within a week. Quality is always amazing:) best online store
"August 29, 2016",2,Bad complaint handling,A stray parcel lead me to contact Asos. They just repeated the same thing over and over again ignoring information I was giving them. They think that by saying hi and thanks so much makes thing better but actually they need to take actual fact and work with that and not gloss over the issue with niceties
"August 26, 2016",1,It's cool to have awful customer service.,"Dreadful service. Even ppi cold callers are more helpful than asos so called customer service. Next day delivery was dispatched two days late which I only found out from the delivery company as Asos have yet to reply to my email, tweets and phone calls after 3 days. When the items did arrive there were 2 missing. Tried to contact Asos againand they are quick to tweet back saying they will reply but yet haven't still.There are thousands of people complaining every minute on Twitter about this company with many like myself waiting up to 20 days for a response.Without a doubt the worst customer service you will ever receive. Stay clear."
"August 26, 2016",1,No customer representative contact.,"There is no way to get in contact with a live person for the US version of this company. You can only email, in which they reply in 24 hours and do not help. I was looking for my bag and all they told me is that it shipped already, in which I already knew. They tell you that you can reply back with another question but no, you can't, because you'll never receive another reply (I guess it doesn't go through).It is a day past my expected order date and there's no tracking as well! This company needs to give its US site some more attention!"
"August 26, 2016",5,Absolutely love it,I have ordered twice from Asos now and it is fantastic so far! Much better than pretty little thing omg I could slap those people!!! Asos delivers the parcel exactly when they promise (date). Quality could be much better buy then it depends what you buy. Love my heels they are the cutest! Thank you so much. I love I'll definitely order again :)
"August 26, 2016",1,"VERY UNRELIABLE, SUCH A POOR SERVICE","You advertise Next day delivery yet your service is more like second class and I pay for NEXT DAY  this is very poor. If you know you can not guarantee next day delivery YOU SHOULD NOT ADVERTISE THAT YOU CAN. Every time I try to get in contact with ASOS no one ever answers the phones it just rings and rings, when you do get through to some one they hung up on you without even bothering to give you a call back. ASOS needs to sort all of this out. Such a horrible service this is not how you should treat loyal customers."
"August 25, 2016",1,Sickened and very angry,"I'm a frequent customer (nearly every payday). I ordered £300+ worth of stuff next day delivery. Everything was as normal, until I got a email saying parcels have been delivered. I got home and no sign of parcels, so I contacted them. They said they will raise an investigation with DPD. I then had a DPD delivery driver come to my door!! And start shouting at me called me a liar, very aggressive and not letting me close my door!! He said 'I left here in garden' but nothing was there and also on the DPD system they say I signed for it when I didn't!! Who signed for it?? If somebody signed for it surely they would have taken it into the house and the DPD driver wouldn't have said he left it in the garden?? I rang asos and they didn't seem bothered that I had just had this incident with a driver which was totally unproffessional!!!! after two weeks of emails and phone calls they've now closed the investigation as they say it was 'signed for' and delivered. I can assure you it was not signed for!! Nobody was in the house at that time (we can all prove we were at work!) customer services are a waste of time asking to speak to management but continuely obstructed! Very sickened as I've lost a lot of money and I have no parcel, do not shop unless you want to throw your money away!!"
"August 25, 2016",1,HORRIBLE,"These guys' delivery and customer service is SO unreliable. When I placed a nearly $200 order, what arrived in my order were items that I did not purchase, and certain items I did purchase were missing. When I filed the claim, I requested a REFUND, because I figured ""Ugh, I'm not even going to bother with a replacement at this point."" However, 48 hours after filing for a refund, they emailed me saying that my replacements were on the way! I argued with them, stating I had requested a refund, but that if the replacement was already sent out then I would just return it with other items I intended to return. Those replacements never came. Two weeks later when I checked my email, I followed the tracking of the replacement parcel and it was registered as delivered, but I never got the package! When I contacted customer care AGAIN, they said that they never sent a replacement because I requested a refund, and that the refund just hadn't been processed through my bank yet!  When I told them that it had been over the 10 day processing time, they said,""Oh, well, actually we DID send you a replacement and it has been delivered. Did you check in with your neighbors?'' SUCH BS!!!! I REQUESTED A REFUND IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!!NEVER AGAIN."
"August 25, 2016",5,Love this website,"Honestly, I probably ordered hundreds of dollars worth of their clothing from their site, and I'm in love.First off, I live in Canada, and this site is based in the UK. Number one thing I was worried about was duties, and surprisingly enough, I had only been charged duties once out of like 20 orders? I didn't mind as I had 3 clothing in that package, and it was due time.Clothing is affordable, and ships usually within 2 weeks. Sometimes even faster. Their customer service is wonderful. At one point, I didn't receive a package for over a month. I called them, and they resent one dress, and refunded me the other; got my new dress and refund within 2 weeks.The only downside is if you want to return something, you have to pay for shipping to return it. But the process is simple enough, and luckily their return policy is reasonable. I usually collect all my clothes that I want to return from them, and send it all in one go.I created an account JUST to review ASOS, cause I was so surprised that it was so negative.Wonderful company, and I cannot wait to buy more from them."
"August 24, 2016",5,Went Perfectly!,"I had heard of Asos from Youtube and after taking a peek at what they had I decided to make an order. After I had made my purchase I realized that I had forgotten to check for reviews other than the ones from YouTube. I looked them up and saw an enormous amount of bad reviews. I started to panic, but I thought I would just wait it out and see what happens. After only 3 or 4 days my order showed up neatly packaged and in all the correct sizes. I'm really pleased with how it went and relieved that nothing bad happened."
"August 24, 2016",1,Appalling customer service,They don't make it easy when they get things wrong. So easy to order online but try to get a resolution when they don't send what they should have is a nightmare. If as they say it's an online company then when engaged in social media conversations with your customers don't just stop mid way without giving what you plan to do to make things right. Appalling way to treat customers.
"August 24, 2016",1,Never Got It,When the quay x desi perkins collection was released on asos I placed an order for high key gold and high key black and the order was confirmed. I ordered these products ON the 5th of July 2016 it is currently the 24th of August and still no sign of my package. IT HAS BEEN 50 DAYS SINCE MY ORDER WAS CONFIRMED AND STILL NO SUNGLASSES!!!!!! People at ASOS if your reading this please send me my sunglasses
"August 23, 2016",5,Love them!,"Asos is great! Every issues I have had with them has been resolved. I have always recived my money back on refunds. I contact them on Facebook mostly, which they are very quick to respond to, and are always super polite. They have a great variety of clothes, shoes and accessories for both men and women. The free returns is also very useful!The Asos A-List is also a great loyalty scheme, I'm currently level two so I receive quite a few good perks."
"August 22, 2016",1,Dishonnest operations,"Like many companies ASOS will make it easy for you to spend your money. However, the company has no customer support telephone number on their website. After much search, I  finally found a telephone  number on their corporate website (which, for your information is 0207 756 1000 If you are ever in need of chasing anything up). 8 out of 10 times, no one picks the customer support line up when you call and often after 10-15minutes of waiting I hang up. To sum up my experience, 1) - My so called next day delivery were delivered 5 days late.2) - The wrong items were sent. I called to request replacements and the wrong items were sent again.3) - I used their online return system to request a collection 4 times the courier never turned up4) - I called them to ask for this to be sorted they asked me to take the item to the post office as Hermes often does not turn up5) - The items was delivered and signed for 2 days later.6) - I received no refund 10 days after returning the item.7) - After 4 go at the number above, I finally got through to someone to ask where my refund was.6) - I was told they did not have a record of the item in their inventory and that unless I could provide a proof of return  they would not be able to process any refund.7) - After providing the proof of return postage I received an email that said a claim will be made on insurance for me to be refunded.8) - The girl on the phone then explained she will send a refund claim to the department concerned and proceeded to end the call without clarifying what was in the return which was supposed ""LOST IN TRANSIT"" although it was signed for.9) - I then asked her what exactly she was going to refund me for. She mentioned one of the items that was missing in the first order I placed.10) - After listing the items that were in the return, I insisted on receiving an refund request confirmation email whilst on the telephone to check that the items were correctly listed before hanging up.As I write this review, a month has elapsed since I had first placed my order. The refund is supposed to take 48 hours after the request was sent. I will see if it ever arrives.Here is my assessment of the problem at ASOS. 1) - The inventory system at ASOS is chaotic. (the wrong items sent to me on 2 occasion carry a label (affixed to the cover plastic) which is different from the item in the plastic)2) - Their customer support operations are skeletal and poorly resourced3) - Their IT system is very slow or they pretend that it is. Often the people on the phone apologise for how long it is taking to load and once I had to call back because the system was down.4) - Someone is the supply chain is being dishonest with regard to returns. I challenged the girl I last spoke to on the phone about how often items get lost in transit. She told me it happens a lot. I am sorry but if items that are certified delivered are being classed as lost in transit, there is a serious problem that I think ASOS need to get to the bottom of.Well that is my experience. Make of it what you will. This company could be a great company if they could invest as much effort in keeping customers happy as they do sourcing cool items."
"August 21, 2016",1,Do NOT order from ASOS.,"I ordered a shirt for my first day of school. This particular item was sold out in my size for months, so the second it was restocked I ordered it. I received an email saying my order was despatched and would arrive by Thursday, August 18th via the postal service. Thursday came, no delivery. Friday, same thing. Saturday, same thing. I got in contact with their customer service team on two separate occasions. Both times they responded and asked for my information, then the contact completely stopped. I haven't heard back from them at all! It looks like I will be spending more money to purchase a shirt that I can wear on Tuesday for the first day of school. Don't order from ASOS if you want what you paid for. They are the worst."
"August 20, 2016",2,Gone down hill,"Been a customer since 2009!Quality is poor. I've had a number of items break, rip or fit poorly since the beginning of the year.Delivery is slower than usual which is frustrating when you pay for unlimited next day and actually need it.Customer service is the worst. They take hours to respond and don't actually resolve the issue you have. They seem like they don't actually care. I don't think I will order from here anymore."
"August 19, 2016",2,clothing size is ridiculous,I've been a size 8 for years and am in almost every store. For some reason ASOS are VERY considerate in their sizing. An 8 is similar to an extra large. It is horrifying to wear their clothes. The first time I thought there was something wrong with my body! I shrugged it off and thought 'maybe its a one off. after all- all online shopping tends to be pure rubbish.' the size 8 skirt i bought literally fell off. but it kept happening. all 8 sizes just kept falling off but i was still an 8 in every other store. I even weighed myself and took my monthly measurements. Their clothes in general are really lovely in terms of material and design but alas nothing fits small thin people. If you are over weight- definitely shop at ASOS. It's like a stylish Monsoon / Evans / Very.co.uk.
"August 19, 2016",1,Horrific - AVOID,"Won't go into too much detail here but I'll briefly explain why ASOS don't even deserve a star. Have been a loyal customer for a few years with minimal problems. Recently ASOS have closed my account down and they have failed to explain why they have done this. Having tried my best to email them several times over a period of time as well as contacting their advisors on Facebook and Facebook Messenger, I'm not getting anywhere. They keep giving me the same answers which has been viewed as a 'fob off'. I've tried to get them to explain what's gone on and they're unprepared to do this - just close my account and wave me goodbye. They have actually admitted in their first response to me, that if I was to email them, it will be ignored. I've never experienced anything like this before, they have reduced me to tears. I've expressed my confusion and disappointment and they are not interested. If I could upload print screens of their response on here, believe me I would as everyone needs to know this is how ASOS treat their customers. I'm on the verge of reporting ASOS to Trading Standards and will be supplying additional evidence to support my complaint. They have been allowed satisfactory time to respond and half the time when they have responded, their response is poor and in no way does it answer any of my questions.I feel discriminated against, whether it's because I'm a student, my disablement, sexuality, gender, etc I'll never know but it is clear for all to see I've been treated very differently.  Be warned - shop elsewhere as ASOS are not worthy of your hard earned money as evident in my case."
"August 19, 2016",1,ZERO customer service for missing parcel,"Asos, i've bought multiple times from you before but I cannot believe how poor you treat your customers when things go wrong. My parcel has been missing since the 12th July and ever since I reported the issue, it has been nothing but excuses to get the ""delivery investigation team""  to look into my issue. It has been more than a month and my issue is still not resolved! What a way to lose a loyal customer."
"August 19, 2016",1,ASOS cheats customers.,"Asos does not make refunds to customers it owe money to, read their Facebook page & You will see this company does not want to give refunds to lot's of it's customers that has returned a order or not recieved their order.My friend & I, have written to this company over 150 times now & ASOS does not want to answer our messages about giving our money back for ordered products that we have not recieved.When people ask ASOS for their money back they won't answer the customer or they will just say wait a few days or keep asking You the same question, trying to do all that they can not to refund Your money back.When customers ask for their money back thru their Facebook page, ASOS will block the customer that has waited months for a refund, so the other customers can't see that ASOS scams lot's of it's customers.If something goes wrong with Your order, which happens to lot's of ASOS customers, then You can say goodbye to Your money.ASOS says it does not scam people, but what do You call a company that does not want to refund it's customers for products that they have not recieved or for products that they have returned, & afterwards ignore.Their customer service tries to make it look like they want to help the customer but afterwards customer service, will not process Your order.We have waited 3 months for a refund, without getting any money back,ASOS scams people, so if You don't want to get cheated, then You don't want to shop at ASOS.No company in the world has a bad customer service as ASOS does, this company can not be trusted."
"August 18, 2016",4,Great for lounging-around clothes and basics,"I am quite surprised at the number of bad reviews though some criticisms I do agree with. It seems like many people have issues with their customer service. I order from ASOS on a nearly monthly basis. Their items are relatively cheap (compared to the brick and mortar stores around me) so I can get a large amount of items for very little. Quantity does not equal quality though.You are not getting the highest quality here, but you can get a lot of cute items for around the house or casual outings. I had four missing items from my last order. I emailed customer service (I'm surprised a large website in this day and age has no live chat) and the reply was slow compared to other websites. I also wasn't sure if I was talking to a robot or a person. However all I did was send one email letting them know what items I'm missing, they replied saying sorry and two days later my missing items were at my door (and I'm an international customer so 2 day delivery is surprising). So my experience with customer service was quite positive. In short, not the best quality clothes, but you can still get decent items and the price is right. My customer service experience was excellent."
"August 17, 2016",1,Fool me Once,"Shame on me for ordering a second time from ASOS!I placed an order July 30,2016, with a promised delivery date of Aug. 16,2016 at the very latest.    An shipping confirmation telling us our order had been despatched, on Aug. 04, 2016...reconfirming the Aug 16,2016 delivery drop dead date. And so we waited. Last night ( Aug. 16 ,2016) after delivery hours and with no parcel, i started my queries.  You cannot speak to a rep at ASOS,you online email them ( it;s not a chat...you receive repeated canned replies from and army of different names....)or Tweet them (same canned replies), or Facebook them....  I received no info on Aug 16,2016 , but woke up to an email from ASOS, that I( ME), had cancelled my order and could expect refund in ten business days...that's it that's all...no other feedback through any other avenue...just canned, rote, replies to ""hold tight""    I had NEVER cancelled anything, my first contact was after the delivery date was passed...and I was incensed that culpability was being shoved at me....    I finally got a conversation with a rep on Facebook after asking if customer service were bots...( I had been ""hanging tight"" , for well over twelve hours...)   He eventually admitted that the order was inadvertently returned to ASOS ,by ASOS after a mixup with a delivery company. I was never told...it was never my fault...and other than a ""Sorry"" ...you can order again....That was it. No sorry about the mixup, sorry for blaming it on you.....   My son is disappointed. I am worried, as I have read many comments about difficulty getting refunds in a timely manner.....   Because of ASOS lack of communication and slow refund, I will pay interest on my non order.....   If my refund is not prompt and meets their ten day standard...I will be reviewing again.   Silly me, should have known better...had a tough experienc 20 months ago for a dress for my daughter. ASOS...never again."
"August 17, 2016",1,ASOS - Absolute Joke,Honestly the worst experience I have ever had with an online company.Ordered a hat for a party for next day delivery - despite paying extra for next day delivery it arrived 5 days later.Tried to return the item - followed all their guidance - waited all day for the pick up and the courier (Hermes) did not turn up.10 emails back and forth - each time with a different person replying - lots of unkept promises.They finally just said - our returns service doesn't work - please can you post it to us.Appalling - for a company this big.
"August 17, 2016",2,This company is the equivalent of Snorlax from pokemon.,"It's the most frustrating process i have ever been through, found some very cool pants and shoe's at their page and as it was even 60-70% off i had to buy it. Then i even pay extra for express shipping, so then the fun starts, it does not arrive on the date specified while ordering, it arrives with a 50% tax customs amount i have to pay, meaning they have added the full value of the things to the customs not the discounted ones. Then i have to try for a full week on facebook to try and contacting them, it literally takes me a full week for them to tell me ""oh that's customs, send it back"". its by far the worst and slowest customer service i have ever dealt it, the worst part is the people working there answer's you nicely but the frustration of only get 1 answer per day makes the whole experience 100 times worse. lets hope i atleast get a refund, saw another review were they didnt."
"August 17, 2016",5,Amazing Company - Use Them All The Time,"I Love Asos, I'm quite a tall woman and Asos has an excellent range of tall clothing to ensure I'm always looking my best.I have an Asos next day subscription which gives free next day delivery and returns for a year which makes it so much easier and better to shop because I can't try it out almost immediately and if it doesn't fit send it right back and have a refund or exchange within a week.Great Prices and there's almost always a sale on."
"August 16, 2016",4,Generally good,"A few hiccups with delivery times but the majority of experiences I've had have been positive. Good selection, reasonable prices and customer services have always been helpful"
"August 16, 2016",1,"Asos return - scam, They do not refund you!","Asos return - scam, They do not refund you!If you need to return an item ASOS do not refund you. I've send the item back and I never see my refund...."
"August 15, 2016",3,It's ok,Some items look very different when you get them.
"August 15, 2016",3,Just ok,Ok but not great but would use again
"August 14, 2016",5,Amazing customer service!,"I had to review asos.com as ive never recieved such amazing service. My package was delayed due to a shipping issue. I needed the dress for a wedding and was afraid it would not arrive in time, as it was already later than the expected date at this point. I emailed asos customer service and the reply came by the end of the day. The customer service team was very prompt and informative. We were in contact over a week long email thread. They were always professional and very helpful.Thank you Bianca, Jakirul, and Ellie for all the help in recieving my dress before the wedding!!"
"August 14, 2016",2,"Frustrating experience, terrible customber service","I ordered a Calvin Klein handbag on 10-7. With the ordernr I was able to follow the package. On delivery-day I traced it and noticed that Asos had left off the apt number. I had given the right address, as can be verified in my account. I called DHL customer service  but they were 'unable to reach the driver'. So I sat at the window, waiting for the DHL van, which had left hours late, their customer service said. At 16.30 I saw on the website that I had 'refused' the package, which I had not. I was pretty desperate to get that bag actually. 10 E-mails and more than a month later the package had 'arrived back in Germany' and I finally got my money back. Looking on the bright side, they said, 'You can order again'! No excuses or explanation. Thanks for the thought but I'm one of those crazy ones who like to get orders in one go without any hassle at all."
"August 13, 2016",1,"Excuses, excuses","I ordered a pair of shoes from asos on August 3, 2016 and I received them on August 11, 2016. I had ordered from this company once before and didn't have any issues, so I wasn't expecting anything else, but what I had ordered. I open the shoe box to see a pair of very large shoes barely fitting my feet. I look on the box to see that I had received a US size 9.5. I know I had ordered a US size 8.5, but I checked my confirmation email just to make sure I hadn't ordered the wrong size. I didn't. So they sent me the wrong size. I've never had to call asos for customer service before, so I was surprised to see that they didn't have the number on the website, but I did file a complaint through email. It took about 24 hrs for them to respond. I really just wanted a refund, because I figured that they wouldn't be able to replace the shoes with my size. But in that email I was told that I actually ordered a UK size 8, which is equivalent to a US 9.5. I thought, 'wait a minute. Are they trying to convince me that I ordered the wrong size right now?'. So I pulled up the confirmation email and screenshotted the email stating clear as day that I had ordered a US size 8.5. I sent that email and received one from them 24 hrs later saying that I was a ""star"" for sending them a screenshot. They then stated that there was a ""tech glitch"", which switched my size from US 8.5 to a US 9.5. Am I really supposed to believe that? If there was knowledge of this so-called ""tech glitch"", then why did you feel the need to tell me I'm wrong? Shouldn't you have checked to see if I had actually ordered a US 8.5 in the first place, instead of immediately telling me I ordered the wrong size? And now I have to wait a week and maybe some change for them to receive my package first and then they'll give me a refund. I'm hoping there aren't any other complications, because I can't deal. I won't be ordering from them again, it's too much of a hassle."
"August 12, 2016",5,Very pleased with service at ASOS,"Good customer service! I have never had a bad experience with asos, I have returned things for refunds many times and it has always been granted extremely quickly and easily. I like the fashion selection on the website as they stock a lot of more unusual clothes than your usual high street store with a wide range of styles. I have shopped with them for many years and will continue to do so."
"August 12, 2016",1,asos don't want to give a refund,Changed my bank and it took countless emails and showing bank statements to get a refund back. 6 weeks later and 52 emails later and it was resolved. Absolute idiots who haven't got a clue about what customer service is.Be sure to be certain you want the item as its a pain to get your money back from this dreadful company
"August 12, 2016",5,"Reliable, quick & easy.","I order from ASOS regularly and have never had a bad experience. I use ""ASOS Premier"" as it guarantees next day delivery for all orders, always on time.Ideal for last minute occasions when you need something new to wear. Love the fact that they have a points system now too, have had a few orders recently where I've been able to have a £10 off voucher. Love it!"
"August 12, 2016",1,"Service is okay, but support is unacceptable","Ordering and shipping is generally a nice process with good prices, but if anything goes wrong then you're screwed.Support are rude, clearly don't have access to the information they need or are just not willing to check and they refuse to help. They'll lie to you and mislead you to make you go away.."
"August 12, 2016",1,Poor quality item and bad returns experience.,Received a poor quality item when it finally arrived well over 10 days. Customer services are virtually non existent and do not have a clue. After 2 weeks still waiting for a refund. Avoid this company as there are much better alternatives out there.
"August 12, 2016",1,Terrible customer services and items,"I ordered well over a week ago and my item has still not arrived, all it says is processing. Customer services never answer the phone and she they do, they are rude and dismissive. Worst company i have ever used."
"August 11, 2016",2,Inflexible doesn't keep customers,"I ordered a jacket that looked nice. As a broad guy, I don't like baggy jackets that make me look huge and boxy, so I ordered a jacket that was billed as a 'slightly' tailored fit, order your usual size. As it turns out, my friend has the same jacket and showed me how it actually fits his frame and how it won't fit mine. I did some more research online and found that it is indeed recommended to order up one-two sizes (I'm already at the top of what was offered.)My order has been on hold for over a week now and there is a notice that there is a shipping delay for at least another week. I asked to cancel my order for the sizing issue and pointed out the shipping delay which should give ample time to make this cancelation in an orderly way, but the response was that it was already boxed up and that I would have to return it (with options and prices, even though it won't ship for another 1-2 weeks.) That is a canned response and one that doesn't consider the customer or the circumstances. I understand that cancelling on an order that is shipping out the next day could cause all kinds of hassle and confusion. I don't consider myself to be unreasonable, but...In effect, what was said, was ""We have put your order in a box and are going to let it sit on the table for another week or two before we ship it. While we have plenty of time to process such a cancelation in a orderly and considered way, we don't do 'flexibility' here. We don't care about you (the customer) enough to make a call down to the warehouse and I am telling you three weeks ahead of time that you will need to pay the money to return this item."" I do a fair bit of my shopping online and I've been ""disappointed, but understanding"" in the past. I get it when there are real reasons for something. I don't get this, I don't ASOS them to do 'good business', and I won't order here again."
"August 10, 2016",1,Refusal to refund £190 of  returns they lost,"I sent back 3 parcels and was only refunded for 2 of them, convenient that the missing parcel they claim is lost was the most expensive at £190 of returns. I've provided proof of postage for the missing parcel but because I don't have 1 of the recipts for another parcel I've been refunded for already they say they can't do anything.  Very angry and will most definitely not be using ASOS again and will make sure none of my family or friends do either."
"August 10, 2016",1,TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!,"There should be an option to give no stars! The customer service at ASOS is absolutely appalling, placed an order June 28th, today is August 10th (so far its be 34 days) my parcel has went missing, after hounding asos they admitted that the parcel was 'lost', shipped a second parcel, who knows where this one has gone to.A present ordered for a friends 30th birthday, which has long since been and gone, second time the order shipped something was out of stock. Do you think i've had a refund? OF COURSE NOT!This customer service team seem to want to make it as difficult as possible for the customer to get their money back, after getting nowhere on social media and through email, I called, passed around and hung up on. Asked for a manager to call me with a resolution...NOTHING, NO CALLS, NO REFUNDS.They have my money so that's all they care about.Honestly the worst customer service i've experienced in a while, trading standards should investigate!!!"
"August 09, 2016",1,Didn't Receive My Order!,"I ordered an item of clothing from ASOS. I received a confirmation email saying my order would be with me within a few days.A week and a half later (and still no delivery) I received an email from ASOS, thanking me for my return and that I would be refunded?!?I find it disgusting that their website does not offer a direct telephone number or email address for me to discuss the issue further. Instead they have a ""Ask A Question"" section where I made my complaint, only to receive an automated email reply back the next day! Poor show!First and last time I order from this company!"

"August 06, 2016",1,Absolutely awful.,"Found some really cute dresses on sale and wanted to use them as my bridesmaid dresses. I purchased 7 of them and the total was 1,500. The money was taken out of my account but shortly after I received an email. This stated that they needed a photo of my license/passport, a photo of my recent card billing statement. Both had to be sent over in a pdf form in 24 hours or they would cancel my order. Sent all this annoying information over. Emailed them several times with no response for over 24 hrs. Today,  someone finally got back to me saying they now want another license photo and and photo of my credit card. Are these people insane? Is this even safe? Needless to say despite sending all this information over they cancelled my order, the dresses are now sold out, and the money still isn't in my account."
"August 06, 2016",1,Customer Service is poor,"Hi everyoneI've shopped at Asos many times with no issues but recently I had an issue with an ordered item (parcel tracking number 0307885409059084) because it appeared as delivered when it wasn't. I couldn't get in touch with any helplines to help me track even though it claims to have a 24/7 support team and struggled to find a Asos email address. This is a very stressful experience especially when I made the order with hopes to receive the goods in time for my holiday. As a large and famous company I expected their website to have more clear contact details.  I'm yet to find out the location of my parcel and will wait until next week to call again as these are regular office hours. I fear that my items wont arrive in time and I'm disappointed as I've always had good experiences with Asos. I think this experience alone has put me off ordering from them in future because its looking less likely that I will receive my goods in time for my holiday and if the goods do arrive and dont fit well, when I return from my holiday I will be outside of the return period. I'm very disappointed and urge anyone to reconsider this before they order from Asos. This has added stress to my holiday preparations and I have essentially lost £35 as the item has not turned up.Hannah Rose"
"August 05, 2016",1,WRONG SIZE - DELIVERY CHARGES,"I am beyond disappointed with ASOS products. I ordered 257.16 worth of swimwear, and waited excitedly for delivery. Despite the ""Free Shipping"" that is mentioned everywhere on your website, I was hit with a 90.00 charge at the door for shipping, a completely unexpected charge for me. In fact, had I know about this huge extra charge I would never had purchased the swimwear. You can then imagine my further disappointment when all items were too small. Despite having used your sizing charts,; the bust size is too small. Now I am going to have to ship the items to you, and pay for that shipping. How much money is it going to cost me to NOT to have any new swimwear? And when we took the time to write you and ask, we were basically told, tough luck."
"August 05, 2016",2,"Item 2 weeks late, ASOS playing dumb","I order a lot from uk online stores and only ASOS ship things without tracking number. I order shoes on 10/7/16, i received mail they will arrived on or before(LOL) 21/7. They didn't so I contact ASOS. I was guest at Wedding and i really need them by 29th Well ASOS Said please Wait until 1/08 and I did. I even bought other shoes for Wedding Because Well I Had no option. I contact ASOS again cuz Well shoes didnt't arrive. Customer service asked bunch of Crazy question probably buying time (Can YOU check did someone of your Neighbours took your Package? ) and 3 days ago they said they will investigate whatever happened and someone will contact me soon. No one contact me. It is almoust a month since I order."
"August 04, 2016",3,slow,"I ordered three things. All items arrived, safe and well. Everything went smoothly with the confirmation of my order and i received a mail when it was despatched, and had an easy time tracking it. I am an international customer so i did not expect the order to arrive in five days (like it said), but i certainly feel like two and a half weeks was a lot over that time span. The thing is; the package had been delivered to a place i could collect it from sooner, but i did not receive an textmessage even though i entered my phone number. But i don't know if that's asos's fault. All and all i can say i am happy with my order, it was really just the time that brings the total score down."
"August 04, 2016",5,"Quick delivery , nice range of items","Great prices and service , quick delivery and also free delivery. 5* 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽"
"August 04, 2016",5,"Excellent service, delivery, returns and exchanges. Quality clothes too","I have ordered from Asos several times over the last 5 years and have been extremely happy with every single one of my purchases. The orders always arrive on time or early, it's free, easy and quick to return and exchange items/ sizes. The quality of the product is also fantastic. Such a much better website than other clothing ones! I would recommend to all."
"August 04, 2016",1,No delivery and no customer service,"Ordered products for a holiday and got told they would be delivered Thursday or before . It is Thursday late evening  half 8. No delivery or notification . I have called customer services been kept listening to the voicemail for 40 minutes plus charging me every minute .The customer service is appalling, will be telling everyone not to shop here."
"August 04, 2016",5,I LOVE ASOS and am a regular customer,"Extensive fashion choices, great prices, easy delivery and Returns. I order quite a lot each time for choice and am always returning stuff and have never had any issues with waiting for the money to be refunded. Also, their collect+ delivery and returns is just so easy and fits well into my busy shedual."
"August 04, 2016",4,Problem Solved,"There was a technical issue with the transmission of my order to the warehouse: I received an order despatch e-mail, but my package never arrived. After contacting ASOS they were very quick to uncover the reason for my lack of delivery and promptly issued a replacement package to be sent to me (with free two-day shipping) and gave me a refund for the items that were now out of stock. Pleased with the service I received--"
"August 04, 2016",5,Love it!,"I have been a customer at Asos for a few years now, I order very regularly and also sent something back now and then. Delivery is always on time (I order 2-3 times a month). No problems with refunds, it will take 2 weeks, which is normal for most websites. I have had a complaint about a pair of trousers which was tearing apart the first time wearing it. Within 30 minutes after my complaint I got an answer they would send a new one the same day. Did not even provided a picture. Im a very happy customer, and will continue to keep shopping at Asos."
"August 03, 2016",4,Always on point,"Asos.com has a way worse rating than they deserve. I've rarely had a problem with then, and if a product was not up to the expected standard, I could always return it. I've had more than 10 orders, and I will keep coming back, simply because their sales aren't matched by any other site out there."
"August 03, 2016",2,app and website is a pain,"was ordering some swim shorts and flip flops for holidays.  took ages to place the order, first it wouldn't add items to the basket (""sorry we have technical problems ""), then it would allow me to add items but would not show it in the basket... after a lot of clinking and resetting managed to place the order... fingers crossed it will be delivered..."
"August 03, 2016",1,Worst customer service!!,"I often bought things from this website. Recently order some items around $300 aud all tgt, placed the order on 27th, received a depatched email on 28th but then received a return/refund email on 31st which I didn't do anything to cancel the order. Wrote them emails to try to find out what happened. At first they were giving answers are very general saying could be the carrier couldn't find anyone to receive the parcel which is not possible at all, sent out from uk on 28th and arrive in Australia before 31st? In the end they admitted its something wrong with their warehouse so my parcel got returned. I was getting upset about their attitude but I really like those items so I don't mind to purchase again after I got my refund back, but as I went back to the website check on the items some of them are not available anymore (in previous emails they were saying everything is still available). And all I received from the email just like oh sorry this happened. Worst experience ever."
"August 03, 2016",4,It is okay to shop with ASOS,"Update:  My package arrived only two days after the specified due date.  I didn't realize the package would need to be shipped from the UK. This one was me being totally disgruntled and  I have to eat my words.  Boy do they taste A LOT LIKE CROW.  Good Job ASOS and thank you for your quick customer service response.  ORIGINAL REVIEW NOW RECANTEDGranted, ASOS has beautiful items on their website and because they are an international company, I had hesitated ordering for the longest time.  Luckily, I spent less than $10.00 US on the site so if my order never shows up, I am not out that much money.  I was supposed to have received my package by August 1, 2016 and emailed their ""NO CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPT.""  Their website was jacked up so I had to send a manual email to them and couldn't even use the form they had on the site.  I have the most updated tablet, laptop and Chromebook money can buy so it isn't my equipment.  My gut told me to avoid ordering from ASOS and I wish I had listened.  I will be disputing the charge with my bank and trying to get my money back."
"August 02, 2016",1,"Their own brand product ""Asos"" are really bad!!!!",I bought three pairs of shoes from Asos own brand. All of them was really bad and all of them was broken after one week of use. They were cheap and rubbish! Be careful!
"August 02, 2016",1,Premier Delivery Failure,"I paid £9.99 for premier delivery. When I queried why my items were being delivered 2 days later than promised, I received the response, ""we're super busy at the moment"". I'm afraid that I don't care how busy the company is, if they're charging for a priority service, they should deliver. I have not at any point been offered any compensation for this so have had to ask for a refund on my delivery charge. Shocking policies / customer service. First tie I've used ASOS for about 10 years and probably the last!"
"August 02, 2016",1,Disgusting customer service!!!!!!,"This company is diabolical to say the least!! They very rarely give you a refund unless you fight for it!! The last one took me 2 months to get back and since the emails I sent either got ignored or seem to ""confuse"" them? I telephoned the Asos help line which I googled!! They made all the promises to sort this out after 4 calls, but then when my phone bill arrived I had been charged over £22!in calls!!! I could not believe it, not only did they not refund me I had this cost on top. When I queried it they said "" oh this isn't our number?? You shouldnt ring these numbers???Unbelievable!!! I sent several complaints but it got me no where, this company shoud be banned from trading."
"August 01, 2016",3,Generally good but some issues,They more than likely have what you are looking for and more often than not it is a pleasant experience with free returns. They will even collect the parcels. There are always 'sales' so how much of a sale it can be I'm not sure... however you can find good bargains. Occasionally orders are cancelled when they have oversold which is a pain.
"August 01, 2016",5,So happy I found out about this site!,This is my favourite website! There's a lot of variety in the clothing and accessories they sell. The return policy is quick and the shipping is too. Would totally recommend!
"August 01, 2016",1,Worst Online Shopping Expereince,"How will one feel, if you ordered something approx 4 months back and every month they tell you, oh pls verify your address and then then commit that they are now sending a new parcel.This is by far the worst experience I had"
"July 31, 2016",1,Worst customer service ever,"My order did not appear, so I tried to contact the company.  The email address they give you for Customer Help is a non response email account that directs you back again to the non responsive email account.  It is very frustrating.     Waiting"
"July 31, 2016",5,Great service,DONT UNDERSTAND WHY SO MANY PEOPLE GAVE BAD REVIEW ASOS IS CURRENTLY DOING VERY WELL ALWAYS ORDER FROM THEM NOW FAST DELIVERY GOOD QUALITY AND GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND !!!
"July 31, 2016",5,always good,"I always love shopping in ASOS , without being worry about size or quality because of their amazing and easy return policy , always I order 2 sizes so I can choose exactly what I want , ASOS always makes me happy and comfortable with my online shopping , very fast delivery even click and collect in my local shop. I should say thanks to them , they made my shopping easier and I don't need messing around in shops and searching online ! always would do shopping with my app in few minutes ."
"July 30, 2016",4,Shies and trousers,"Navy asos culottes with turn up,  silver pointy ballet shoes. Delivery time fast,  fit of each item was as described.  Material of the culottes was very pleasant,  fitted but with a lycra  type give to it."
"July 30, 2016",4,Top! 👍,Fine quality and fast delivery. My first time on Asos.com.
"July 29, 2016",1,Bad! Bad! Shockingly BAD!,"Ordered a couple of times.  Not great quality but cheap.  No particular issues but when you have a problem like wrong item sent out, chasing refunds you will have a horrid time with them.  Customer service is VERY bad.  They don't answer emails, don't answer the phone and when they do they are VERY rude and give you all sorts of excuses.  They also cut the line and don't call back so you have to call again and explain the whole thing over again as they don't keep records.  This company is a complete waste of time.  They do not value their customers and are obviously too big to care.  I emailed the MD on nickb at asos.com and no response.  So I guess if the MD does not give two hoots about the customers you shouldn't expect the staff to.  Shockingly bad service around from this company.  Don't spend a large amount of money with them unless you are prepared to lose it.  Bad Bad and Very Bad!"
"July 29, 2016",5,Great experience!,"I work in the Fashion Industry and get really annoyed from bad quality and weak services. I loved every piece I ordered. I got perfectly fit sizes and good quality. Also fast delivery, thank you Asos."
"July 29, 2016",5,No problems at all,Quick deliveryA little slow DK (free) return with ReBOUND. I received my money two days after ASOS received the return.Never got a wrong item.I did't try the customer service... yet.
"July 29, 2016",5,Brilliant,Brilliant site fast delivery ! Easy returns
"July 29, 2016",1,Will never buy again,"Ordered my first order with asos, £65 worth of clothes and it didnt arrive, had to wait 5 days to get a response form courier company before asos could do anything, spent numerous time and effort on the telephone, agreed to give them another chance and would accept replacement rather than refund. Couldnt get that right either, 3 days later no emails, no order no nothing. Had to call again, turn around to get my money back 5 days ! Total amount of time they have had my money and i have had no goods, 2 weeks ! Cannot trust them to do anything, just lost a new customer, AVOID AVOID AVOID"
"July 28, 2016",1,Terrible,Every single time I ordered from ASOS (5-6 times) the items I received were sized wrong or not what I ordered (incorrect item). Their customer service is equally bad. It might seem nice of them to give free returns but it seems as though they only offer it because they know their products are bad. Please don't waste your time and $4 on shipping money!
"July 28, 2016",5,"Amazing customer service, solved issue quickly.",Had an issue with a refund a couple months ago. They replied and sorted out the issue quick and with little effort on my side. Polite and friendly. Delivered on time and neatly. Decent standard of clothes. Would recommend.
"July 27, 2016",1,completely scammed LOL,"This company is indescribable. I ordered from them on the 16th and today is the 27th and still nothing. I ordered three items and have reached out to them questioning where my parcel is. The customer service is beyond awful and I will not be purchasing from them ever again. If any of you who are reading this are thinking about purchasing from them, just dont."
"July 26, 2016",5,One of the best webshops out there,"Especially now that it's possible to return for free.Promotions are often worth it, they carry a wide array of brands. Icluding brands that are impossible to find elsewhere.Have been ordering there for years, the very few times there was a problem, it was resolved immediately. I'm surprised they don't have a high rating here."
"July 26, 2016",1,Awful Quality,"Unless you've seen an item in real life and you know exactly what you're buying, don't purchase anything from ASOS because the quality is absolute garbage. I've bought so many things from them, thinking that I just had to make better choices, but I would end up with RAGS. Consider yourselves warned."
"July 26, 2016",2,Terrible Returns Service,"I have returned two parcels in past 6 weeks and both times, an item enclosed in the parcel was not refunded.  The process to then get this rectified was onerous with obstacles put in my way to delay things e.g. providing all details, then being asked two days later to confirm the details again 'for security purposes' before they could do anything; asking to send proof of postage, even though parcel received as part of the refund had been processed.  If this was a one off I could accept mistake, but as happened twice, wonder if deliberate - raised exec complaint which resulted in refund being actioned, but all other queries I raised were ignored"
"July 26, 2016",4,Overall happy with the company,"At times slow answers via e-mail, however always been helpful.next day delivery/free returns for just under  a tenner a year is perfect too."
"July 26, 2016",5,FANTASTIC,Ordered my item on Sunday at around lunch time and it came the next day by 12pm even though I had only paid for the cheapest delivery! Very impressed!Thank you :)
"July 25, 2016",1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,"I ordered an item that has never came. When I emailed the company and they basically told me to wait, check with my post office for an item with no tracking number and to knock on my neighbors doors. I am fighting to get my refund for an item that clearly was never sent and the worst customer service I've ever dealt with. Like I said do not waste your time and money."
"July 25, 2016",1,I wouldnt order from them again...,"Definitely NOT. I have no idea how they've managed to get away with as much as they have for so long, seeing other negative reviews only confirms that I will not be shopping there again (after my first buy). I bought a skirt and the one that arrived was nothing like the picture or the catwalk video, I tried to contact the customer helpline and held for half an hour while a repeated automated voice was saying ""thanks for holding we will be with you shortly"" they certainly were not with me shortly! After 35 mins I gave up, MASSIVE time waster, for some reason I expected more from them being quite a popular online store. Sort it out ASOS!!"
"July 25, 2016",3,Got my stuff okay but customer services is awful,How do they survive with service like that?
"July 25, 2016",5,Only good experiences,"I think many people forget to write about their good experiences at Asos, since the rating is so bad in here. I have shopped at the website plenty of times now, and I have been satisfied with every order. Definitely one of my favorite online clothing stores!"
"July 24, 2016",5,Excellent,Asos is an excellent company to ahop with. Always deliver is an extremely timely manner and good are always of excellent quality. Postage is cheap and quick and can sometimes be free with the use of promo codes. Returns are also processed in a fast and efficient manner.Couldn't fault my experience with ASOS and it will continue to be my go to store for clothing.
"July 24, 2016",1,Beware of the A-LIST Scam!,They make you spend money to get money off vouchers. The problem is when you get your vouchers they dont work (and you only find out when you actually order) so feel it's a scam. You can email their customer service but you won't get any reply or explanation!
"July 22, 2016",5,Fantastic,"Every single delivery I have received has been on time (and I've ordered a lot!), customer service has been excellent every time and I love Asos a list, all round fab! :)"
"July 21, 2016",1,Customer Care - No one is TRAINED PROPERLY. Am I speaking to 15 year olds?,"As the title states, no one appears to have been trained properly. No one speaks perfect English, I sometimes wonder is this company full of kids? They don't know what they are actually talking about, they never actually respond to customer's questions. Why are you constantly saying 'I will get the ball rolling for you' to process the refund? Orders always get lost in transit... Quality is awful... Automated emails... No personal approach... It's a mess. A big FAT MESS."
"July 21, 2016",5,Excellent,I shop on ASOS on basically a weekly basis and have done so for a number of years. If there are ever any problems (which I very rarely have) then they can easily be contacted via Twitter or the telephone. I am so pleased ASOS use DPD who are very efficient and not such others which I won't mention who are useless.I would recommend ASOS to all my family & friends.
"July 21, 2016",1,If i could rate 0 i would,"awful customer service, every question i asked they answered with a no. can i give you my order number - no can i speak to a manager - no can i cancel my order - no can i do anything - no I wanted to scream, it was as if i was speaking to a robot. Awful experience, and one i won't risk enduring again."
"July 21, 2016",1,Awful customer service,"I order lots of things from asos but this particular time did not receive my parcel! They say it was delivered to a neighbour, I can't get my package and they refuse toResend or refund me despite me spending a lot of money with them and being a repeat customer!! I am disgusted and feel they should as a gesture of goodwill resend the package! Bearing in mind I have never called to complain before!!"
"July 20, 2016",1,Canadian Customers BEWARE,"Although I searched the site for as mun information as possible, here are some things they DONT TELL YOU.1. YOU WILL PAY DUTY...  I paid $90 for about $300 worth of merchandise2. If you need to return a shipment and you live in Canada, you are required to ship to UNITED KINGDOM AT YOUR EXPENSE. - you will be required to choose RUSH or EXPRESS POST in order to meet the return deadline  ****** COST ME ANOTHER $135 (+ insurance)3. The Quality is GARBAGE, Don't waste your time.4. Customer Service was not willing to help in any way nor do tey take any responsibility on improper notification of fees you will acquire."
"July 20, 2016",1,Awfull Service,"A few times now i have orderd from asos and it hasn't been right and ive just left it but this time i orderd a bag and they sent me the complety wrong bag it was disgusting and cheap and nothing like the one i had orderd. I have emaild the ""customer care team"" because i am unable to call chargeable numbers on my tariff, im still to hear from them. Wont be ordering from them ever again!"
"July 20, 2016",1,The first and the last i shope at Asos,"I placed an order on the 8/7/2016. And it should be delivered yesterday,on the 19/7.Haven't seen it yet.The local post office haven't seen it neither !where is my delivery ,Asos ? I have send them emails.And get stupid,bland answers.Not taking the situation serious.Its the first time,i shop at Asos.I normally shop at Zalando ( great service)But it will be the last time as well to order from Asos."
"July 20, 2016",1,"Faceless, careless, useless!","Ordered product fine ....then nothing   No follow up on my customer service request as to where parcel is.  Parcel courier not able to help and referred back to ASoS   Apart from automatic responses  10 days on still no word of what has happened the parcel.  it was a black dress for a funeral   Not impressed will never use this company again. Faceless, careless useless."
"July 17, 2016",5,Great!,My wife and I are happy with the price and quality! Thank you
"July 17, 2016",1,Discusted .Asos are liars - u would never get item in time cos they are crowd of scam .,"Hi , Omg ! Omg ! I have no words to describe how disapointed i am ! I ordered dress ! Paid extra to get that dress in time , in time today !!! because i needed for tomorrow for christenning ! And dress never arrived ! After paying extra to be on time today ! Contacted delivery company - they said they dont have navigation in the car , so they cant find my adress !!! What ?! Are they for real ? Driver said he will try to deliver on monday . He will try again. Without navigation he will try to deliver on monday . I asked why he didt call me ? He said he didt have my phone number ! What ?! It is on every parcel when u buy something . Omg , it is so unprofessional ! Didnt expect that from asos. Didnt know asos working with such a delivery companies who doesnt have even navigation and dont deliver parcels in time . Discusted . I gonna share this story on facebook and all social media , just to let people know , that they wouldnt trust asos. And i want my money back !!!!!"
"July 16, 2016",1,If I could give less than one star I would,"Absolutely disgusted with the service received from ASOS. I placed an order for 4 items and only received 2 - one of which was damaged. Trying to find somewhere to access their ""customer service"" team was almost impossible. Found the best way to get a response was to start posting to their FaceBook page (If I had thought to look at the comments on that page prior to buying I would never have placed my order!) It has now been well over 6 weeks and I still have not had a refund from them despite daily assurances it was processed and would take 72 hours... I have started a case with PayPal, but ASOS seem to have mastered the art of manipulating that process to take as long as possible. I think I can guess how they have sufficient experience to know how do that. I will never buy from them again."
"July 16, 2016",5,Excellent,"I paid £10 for the year for 'premier' and it's great. Next day delivery, (even got a delivery on a Sunday after ordering sat evening!) easy returns; just fill in the form and stick on the pre paid label and send. I usually get my money back within a week. I'm always notified by email so communication is fine. It's great if you aren't sure of something, you want to see what it looks like or be sure of the size, because it comes so quick and you can get your money back fast. It's definitely my go to site."
"July 15, 2016",5,Great shopping experience.,"I hope I'm not tempting fate, but till now I've been more than happy with my shopping experience at Asos. I'm really surprised to find so many negative reviews, whereas my shopping with them always runs smoothly.I've  sent back clothing for a refund twice without any trouble. Whenever I contacted them by mail I got a reply within reasonable time. My purchases arrive more or less before the expected date. Their site is next to perfect compared to others and their prices are very competitive."
"July 14, 2016",5,LOOOOOVE ASOS,the order i made came in literally 3 days and it wasn't even express delivery!
"July 14, 2016",4,Great Shipping and quality,"Unlike many reviews,I’ve had very good experience with them.I ordered twice and will continue being their customer.As soon as things shipped they sent me a confirmation letter. And I could track it the whole way. It came the days that it said it will arrive.Also returning was very easy. I like their dresses especially and decent price!"
"July 13, 2016",1,Awful,Ordered a jumpsuit for a wedding and when I opened it I happened to find a mark on one of the legs which was a burn mark. Too late to send it back as I didn't expect to receive my outfit with a burn on. Same thing happened to my friend when she received a dress.. It had a big burn mark over it. Terrible. I will never order from asos again.
"July 13, 2016",1,No Answer for more than a month!!!??? Customer service so bad!,"I returned 3 orders packed in one package, got a refund very quickly on two orders, for the third one still haven't got. I have contacted them via their website, email etc, absolutely no answer. I could understand if they didn't accept the order i returned but they have it in their system registered as refund.Perhaps the workers there just slips the money in their pocket???!!!Well done ASOS!"
"July 12, 2016",5,Never had a problem,I have been shopping on Asos for years and am really surprised to see all of the bad reviews. I have never had an issue with my orders. Always arrive on time and always correct. One time an item was missing and they shipped it to me the next day. Always speedy at processing returns and flexible with the returns terms.Love Asos!!
"July 12, 2016",5,Great service and everything,"I have ordered from ASOS a lot of times and only had problems with it once (I'm outside of the UK). My package never came and when it was 5 days late I wrote an email to ASOS. The next day they told me to confirm my adress which I did and then the day after they emailed me saying they would send me a replacement without my cost.I have also returned lots of items back to ASOS and never had problems with my refunds.I have seen a lot of other people saying that ASOS wouldn't help them with this problem, but my experience with customer service was great!"
"July 12, 2016",1,WORST WEBSITE EVER >> DONT EVER ORDER FROM ASOS,THEY NEVER deliver your package and they say they refunded your money with no refunds given until u send 1000000 email and reminders.. BE CAREFUL NEVER ORDER FROM ASOS.. i wish there is a rating worse than bad  to give it to them!
"July 12, 2016",1,Lost package and Bad service,"They lost my package two weeks ago and i have written them many times. They just keep sending me emails, asking me to confirm my address. I also tried facebook - no help!I will never buy from this site again!!"
"July 11, 2016",1,Horrible,"I ordered a pair of shoes as a 7 US sizing, they came in (a day late) as a size 8.5. I emailed my complaint and they had the nerve to tell me that I ordered wrong and order a UK 6 which was a US 8..... Which clearly on the order it says I ordered a 7. Not only are they wrong on that but even if I ""did"" order that size, they still sent a 1/2 size larger. Horrible."
"July 11, 2016",1,Dissapointed,"I emailed asos on the 1st of July with a complaint and have still not received a reply. I received a faulty damp smelling dress which I reported to them, they sent me out a replacement pretty soon which was good. However, the replacement dress also had the same damp smell. I was then advised that they can't offer me any discount but may be able to cover dry cleaning costs, but then another person told me that this was not the case as the dress is machine washable.  I expressed how I didn't want to keep the dress at full price incase the smell doesn't wash out. After several weeks of waiting for email replies and taking time to contact via telephone on the last email I was told that they cannot offer me a discount on the dress and the most I could received was 10% off a full price item. I didn't think this was sufficient for all my time that was wasted and the poor customer service I dealt with so I sent a final email which is below:HiI am so upset to hear that the most u can offer a loyal customer of many years is a 10% off code off full price items only.  I will be returning the dress today, it has been a waste of my time contacting you via phone and emails several times hoping that you will help me. I have waited weeks to hear back from you and your time to respond has been appauling.I will be making this public and informing others of your poor customer service and no customer loyalty. I won't be shopping with asos again.Till today I have not received any reply and I am really upset that a loyal customer means nothing to them."
"July 09, 2016",1,"Lost orders, lies and incompetence!","So I ordered 2 bridesmaid dresses for a wedding, one pink, one grey. Other bridesmaids made similar orders at the same time as me. Everyone else received theirs. I didn't. They told me to wait until the following wednesday. Of course, it didn't come. My order was ""dispatched"" and my tracking information on asos said nothing, and the tracking information with Hermes just said ""order placed"". I alerted them to this immediately because it should have updated to say dispatched and then when it got scanned to be at a local depot etc, then out for delivery.Of course this never arrived, I doubt it was ever sent.Customer service told me if I was worried about it not arriving I could order it again and return one set. So, not helpful, why should any of us make 2 orders just in case one gets messed up?By the time they'd accepted my order wasn't coming (a week later), the grey dress was out of stock. The pink dress was in stock. Customer service informed me they would re order the pink one for me (next day delivery).Next day...a grey dress arrives. So even though this dress was out of stock, they've managed to get it and send it to me, and even though the pink one was in stock they were unable to send this. There was no earthly reason why they couldn't have resent my actual order. Or why it was messed up in the first place.When I informed them I had received a grey dress, they said they were unable to re order the other due to stock issues. Which is an absolute lie. They were 100% in stock at the time. And the grey dress was not. So who even knows how they've managed that. Customer service carried on to ask if it was in stock why didn't I order it? And no, I'm not paying twice for my original order. When I make an order I expect to get it. Not have to re order things every step of the way when they keep messing up.And quite frankly I don't want to give them my business. I ordered two different sizes to try on for the wedding, thankfully the one I have fits fine and I really don't want to go through this process again just to try the other one on. At least I've got one I can actually wear to the wedding. Really would never use them again, if it wasn't for my friends wedding I would return this dress, but knowing how bad the customer service is, that would probably never get refunded. They have refunded me for the one dress (that wasn't even out of stock). Great. So I made an order, and they can't carry it out and have refunded me for half of it, that they could have actually carried out. Absolutely ridiculous and totally incompetent. No apologies, no offer of a partial refund to make up for the ballache of trouble their idiocy caused. Just, oh well we'll give you the money back for one we can't be bothered to re order.Bye Asos. Never again."
"July 08, 2016",4,"Great online clothes co - huge range, rarely don't find what i want","The range is massive - for me they are to close to current trend e.g. , say, 1000 jeans, all skinny. 4 loose - bit extreme but you get the gist. Bought tons of stuff from them and never sent anything back though given some as gifts where not quite right. Site easy to navigate but would like better descriptions. Lots of own brand which is cheap and cheerful and small! Delivery extra quick. Recommend them! cheers"
"July 07, 2016",1,Shame on you,"I have been battling - yes battling - for over 24 hours to get an answer and still get nothing - really mad at Asos i won't order from them anymore.My order is extremely late, i am leaving abroad for a year and no one can get it for me - meaning i just lost 250£ in the wild. Terrible experience with ASOS brand. Next time i'll get some topshop.Unable to provide an answer i am highly doubtful that i will ever be refunded. I feel utterly disgusted by the way i have been treated - Do not buy here they don't give a flying F about you and just want your money & silence. They will treat you awfully in case anything goes wrong because they are too big to care."
"July 07, 2016",5,Excellent Service,"I bought my husband a pair of Doc Martens Bonny Tract boots size 9 from this company, it was free delivery and arrived this morning by Hermes.Order number 214410049.I received several emails and free tracking which kept me in the loop. I have used the company before in the past and will continue to do so. Very happy with the purchases i have made past and present.Top marks"
"July 06, 2016",1,ASOS I hate u,I live in Ukraine and all orders from ASOS do not come! Permanent loss. The feeling that they do not send parcels. Ordered express delivery but received like royal mail !orders number 214933251 and 214927005.You do not value their loyal customers. GOOD BYE ASOS 4EVER!
"July 06, 2016",2,never again,"I have been a loyal customer for years, and as long as I never had to deal with customer services thats been fine.A package has been late here and there but fine.But I have now actually had a package go missing and of course it was a dress I needed for a certain date.I contacted customer services via email as well as facebook with absolutely no help. No refunds, no nothing.So basically I am out of money with no dress and no one has gotten back to me. It´s rude basically.So I will give my money to someone else inte the future."
"July 05, 2016",1,Terrible customer service!,"I placed an order on the 14th of June and paid additionally for international express delivery. I should have received my goods until the 17th of June. Still waiting after two whole weeks! The package is gone and my local post delivery service have no idea where it is. After many emails to Asos I get the same answer, we have contacted dpd and we are waiting for response. How hard can it be to figure out where a package is! I demanded a refund and of course now they do not want to answer me. This was my second time ordering from Asos and I will never order from there again!"
"July 04, 2016",1,No customer service,"Dont buy from here if you live in the u.s. there is virtually no customer service, your package wont be tracked and they take their sweet time getting you money back to you"
"July 04, 2016",1,Disgusting customer service!! Still haven't received my refund for weeks!,"Placed an order, never recieved it, asked for a refund but instead they sent me 2 of my items out of 4 which by that point I didn't want them, I just want my refund, so I sent the 2 items back! Still waiting on my refund for the other 2 items! Sent multiple emails some of which I've had to send twice as no one is replying! I will never shop with this company ever again!"
"July 04, 2016",1,Customer service?,Had issues with my order and no-one seemed to care or want to sort it out. It's a real shame as they have such a good range of clothes but can't get the basics right.
"July 04, 2016",1,Asos is horrible,"Bought a shirt off Asos 2 weeks ago.Last Wednesday I emailed them to ask if there'd been a problem with delivery .Friday they replied to me asking me to confirm my address . I did this instantly .Never heard back from them .Saturday I emailed them to ask if they'd got my email , and what was happening . They asked me to confirm my delivery address . Which I did ! (Again!)That's the last I've heard from them.Unbelievable customer service .Now I'm trying to go through PayPal to get a refund .Thanks Asos .... For nothing."
"July 03, 2016",5,Love it!,"Fast delivery, great products and prices!"
"July 03, 2016",1,No really... They don't have ANY customer service. Zero.,"This is such a shame, because I had no problems with ASOS a few years ago when I purchased from them (although I don't believe I had any issues I needed to contact them about). But with my most recent order, they sent the wrong item. I messaged them twice, and two months later, still no response. Sad Trombone. So buy at your own risk... if they send the wrong thing (which they really might do) it's yours to keep!"
"July 01, 2016",1,DO NOT BUY HERE EVER,"WARNING If you are considering to buy in ASOS. They don´t have customer service... they just don´t answer emails at all (after 4 days they haven´t gotten back to me). It´s impossible to get an answer from them, I even wrote them on FB and... same thing. It´s a nightmare and Im afraid they will not even refund me.DO NOT BUY HERE.Please make sure you don´t buy at ASOS"
"July 01, 2016",1,Never Again,"I love ASOS clothing and have been a customer of theirs for years. I've never had an issue with ordering or receiving my product... until now.I made an order with ASOS for $159 on June 12th to a temporary address I would living at for two weeks. I work on the road, so I'm rarely in one location for more than a few weeks at a time, so I made sure to place the order so it'd definitely arrive within my scheduled stay at the address. The delivery date was June 16th, and it came and went by without my package showing up.I immediately contacted ASOS through their website about the missing package and the frustrating song and dance began. At their request, I contacted all the shipping companies that handled my package. UPS  handed my order off to USPS for final delivery, but they had no record of my order. I checked all around the mail room of the apartment I was staying at. I even knocked on neighbor's doors to see if the package was accidentally delivered to them to make 100% sure the package wasn't delivered. ASOS is very slow responding to customer service emails. I wish they had a phone number so I could have talked to ONE person about my issues all at once, but using the email I talked to multiple people over a two week period. Every time I talked to a new person, I had to give them all of my information again. Order number, email address, date of birth, and what my problem was. Repeating this information over and over made me feel like I was talking to a brick wall, because each customer service agent seemed to have to start the entire process over again each time we spoke. If I felt like my issue was allllmost resolved and they told me they'd get back to me with an answer, the next day a new person would message me asking me to explain the whole situation again. Now it's more than two weeks later and over a dozen emails back and forth with their customer service and I've finally given up and disputed the charge with my bank.It took them a good week to investigate my order and decide if it was indeed missing. By the time they decided they could replace my order, I was no longer at the original address the order was sent to. For whatever reason, they refused to ship the replacement order to a new address. They said it had to be the original address to avoid confusion and lost orders, even if I was no longer at that address.I explained that the order would definitely be lost if they sent it to the original address and asked them to send it to my permanent address, as at that point, I was finished with my job that kept me on the road. I asked them repeatedly not to send the order to the previous address with no luck. I even got into it with them on Twitter, hoping to get a more immediate/better response than contacting them through their email/website. Nope. There is no reasoning with their customer service. No matter how many times I explained my situation, they refused to make an exception for my case. They also would not respond to any questions about refunding my order (except for refunding $50 for two items they couldn't replace as they were out of stock- though I won't know for sure if they actually refunded it for a week or so) as they were sending a replacement order... that I would never get. As of this morning, my replacement package has been sent to the wrong address and I felt like pulling my hair out. It was clear they weren't going to be reasonable and help me, so I contacted my bank and I'm in the process of disputing the charge.I'm totally bummed. I spent my entire summer clothes budget on ASOS and I loved everything I picked out. Hopefully the dispute will go through and I'll get refunded and can spend my money elsewhere.This experience was so bad that I will no longer shop with them and that's the worst part. I can't give them my money when they've shown such disregard for my concerns and ignored my requests to refund my entire order.I hope whoever is at the previous address gets my order and keeps it, to be honest. I hope they're my size and can enjoy some free ASOS clothing."
"July 01, 2016",1,Good for nothing!!,As I ordered over a £100+ worth of gear I get free next day delievery as I have plans the following day to get a text in the morning saying my delievery times has been extended by 24hours! So I decide to email them THREE times only to receive replies from a automated machine so I decide to ring them to be left on hold for 45 minutes so I decide to ring the head office for a nice gentlemen to say he can't to jack about it!!! So I say this benefits me in no way I'd like a refund for him to say that'll take 24 hours to process! If they can change my delievery time in a click of a finger they should be able to refund me in the same way!! How so this business has gone down I receive better customer care at my local chippy as a customer for some years I can say I will never order from this place again and I'll make sure none of my friends and family do aswell!! I hope no one else faces this issue!
"July 01, 2016",1,"unreliable, rude,","unreliable, sent the wrong item because the one we ordered wasn't in stock (why was it even on the site)paid for next day delivery to be told by text it wasnt arrivingthe help line was literally ""yeah we well we dealt with 150,000 orders yesterday"" ie so what?. couldn't cancel the order ""you will have to send it back when it arrives"" We will never use them again."
"July 01, 2016",1,Worst customer service ever,"Customer service is terrible, Can't get through to customer service on phone it's always busy, no reply to emails and order processing time too long! Says can only cancel orders within 15 minutes of ordering but cannot get through to customer services in 15 minutes was waiting to get through to them for 20 mins before I hung up. Will not be Ordering from Asos again"
"July 01, 2016",4,The most favourite online shop,"Very pleased with service and quality. Had some issues with delivery a few times, but it was sorted very quickly. Very happy with a next day delivery option and customer service. Well done!"
"July 01, 2016",1,Wish I'd read the reviews here first,Did a large shop with them (£100+). Noticed the next day I couldn't find the details of the order on my account. Phoned up and they said something about the system then told me the payment didn't go through so I had to order all over again. (Would of been nice if they informed me as I did have an order number and ect). To be honest I couldn't remember all of the items but I still ordered £100+ worth of stuff again (didn't get some of the items from before as I then couldn't find them which was REALLY annoying). I waited for it today then in the last 40mins of my three hour delivery time I got an email saying that my items won't arrive today. I'm fed up with them already and wish I'd read the reviews on here first. Won't be ordering here again.
"June 30, 2016",1,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER RECEIVED BY ONLINE CLOTHING STORE,"after trying to contact them THREE times with no reply, I am told they will not refund an order i placed after being LOCKED OUT OF MY ACCOUNT for 2 weeks because my bank thought it was a fraudulent charge. i confirmed with my bank it was in fact me that purchased the item but instead of asos reaching out to me or investigating the issue or asking me to update my credit card information in my account, they canceled my entire account and banned me from the site without any reason to!!! after I had reached out to them 3 times and never receiving a reply or reason as to why this was happening! i've never been treated like this from any CS team and have been a loyal customer that purchased from them regularly.  completely unacceptable and staff is SO rude.  will never order from here again and will tell anyone that will listen to do the same."
"June 30, 2016",5,Best Online Clothing Store,"​Had a great experience with ASOS. Great clothes which fit me really well. Recently bought a bomber jacket 3 months ago. Which started to fade with orange patches on it. Complained to ASOS, returned it and got a full refund, which was awesome. Wish they wouldn't use Hermes delivery which can be a bit dodgy. Great experience so far"
"June 30, 2016",5,Never had a bad experience,"Been ordering pretty much all my clothes from here for years so have my friends family and boyfriend Always great sales on always great quality always on time, always get back to you with any question you have about there stock items or policy's what more could you ask for? Unsure why it has so many bad reviews:(  LOVE ASOS!! And it's actually real chirpy cool people that have a sense of humour when they email you back lol x"
"June 29, 2016",5,Never had a bad experience!,"I love Asos! I have ordered from this site numerous times and never had a bad experience. I almost always get free delivery and free returns and I always find all their products (clothes, shoes, accessories, make-up) all good quality and good value for money.I would definitely recommend this site!"
"June 29, 2016",5,Always order from this website,I've never had a bad experience with Asos and have been ordering from them for a few years now . Always quality products and fast delivery . Customer service are always willing to help .  It's my first choice of shopping
"June 28, 2016",1,Don't care about the loyalty of there customers!,"Ok it's going to quite a long story because I'm really not happy with my experience with ASOS.I wouldn't say I shop at ASOS all the time but it's quite frequent and at the end of the day I pay towards their business every time I do.I have been shopping around for some black boots for a while when I saw some I loved on their website. Now this was on a Monday and I knew I had the day off Tuesday so I ordered them and paid the extra delivery charge to ensure i was in when they delivered. So this was a charge of £5.45. I had to do this because I live in apartment block so there was no 'safe place' or couldn't leave with neighbour because you had to let someone in from the front door through a phone in your apartment. They had no way of getting in unless someone did this. I waited in all day for my parcel to then recieve a text from DPD saying sorry we missed you?! I was confused. I went downstairs and the delivery guy had been let in cause he posted the note through our postal box downstairs in the hall. (I live in the 5th floor). This was about 2:55. On the note that he left he had put 3! I was very angry he had made absolutely no effort or attempt to contact me in my apartment and so he could get paid and finished he just posted that clearly made up a time and off he went.Being very upset that I paid the charge for nothing if their employees weren't going to do there job properly, I contacted DPD as it was their delivery driver in the wrong. Back and forth emails with me getting more and more frustrated they then decided it isn't anything to do with them it's ASOS. So I contacted them, explained it. And all because the delivery driver took a photo of my apartment block name it was proof he had been there and made his attempt. They had no sympathy what so ever for this situation. And in their emails pretty much makes me out to be a lier. I work full time and travel a lot of hours  so couldn't just pick it up from anywhere because of there opening times. So I had to choose a place that suited me and go out my way to pick it up. I paid £5.45 for no reason and then cost me in fuel to go out my way to pick it up. I have lost complete faith in ASOS and the companies they use, and will not be shopping with them ever again. Now if they fixed the situation and refunded the delivery charge back it would be different but they have done nothing what so ever to reconcile this."
"June 28, 2016",3,Not bad but not good,Dress ordered arrived with wrong size. They changed it for me just in time for the event. All well that end well
"June 28, 2016",5,fab!,"Always use asos , perhaps a bit too much! I have premier delivery and always receive no problems the next day, also free returns and always refunded within about a week. Any problems I have ever had they always get back to me really quick and are super helpful :) ! quite shocked by the bad reviews to be honest as I use them about twice a week"
"June 28, 2016",1,I wish I had looked at the reviews before placing my order,"I placed my first order with ASOS on 6/16. I was supposed to receive my order on or before 6/23. It is 6/27 and I still have not received my order. When I contacted customer service, they advised me to check that the address is accurate- it is. Inquire with anyone in my household if they accepted the package, check with neighbors, and the postman. I live alone and place a check mark next to the other two. Now what? They are investigating the delivery. If I do not receive the merchandise I paid for, I will report them for fraudulent practice, and I will do everything in my power to get my money back. I should receive the item I paid for, or I should get my money back. If they are a reputable company, they will be responsible to their consumers. I will update my review when I receive a response from them."
"June 28, 2016",4,"Came super fast, but shoes a little not true to size","I read A LOT of reviews about Asos, mainly that their order never arrived. I was skeptical about ordering from them, but I decided to anyway. The package came faster than estimated! They shipped the package on Thursday (NZ time), and arrived Tuesday morning! 3 days earlier than estimated, really pleased by it. The only issue I had, which I tend to have with ordering shoes online, is that they are not to true to size. I myself am a 9.5, and my mother is a size 10. She can fit it, but its pretty tight. I always order 10, since I always have this problem when buying shoes online. So if you are a size 10, try to order a 8.5UK shoe size instead of 8UK. Otherwise buying from Asos was an easy process!"
"June 27, 2016",1,Bad company stay well away,"Ordered £100 Nike air max bw Persian. Asos sent defective items, one trainer in a size 8 and the other in a size 8.5, I phoned Asos Monday 20th to tell them of there mistake but unfortunately the computers where down at the time. I was told by Asos I would receive the replacement pair of trainers as late as Friday 25th, still no replacement trainers. I phoned Asos late Friday to ask why I didn't receive the replacement, again computers where down. I now have no trainers and no email to say as and when I would receive the trainers I purchased for £100 pounds. I'd recommend people stay well away from this company, in my mind Asos are thiefs and corrupt. Do not buy from them..."
"June 27, 2016",1,"Terrible experience, never to use again","This was my first purchase on ASOS and will deffinately be my last.I sent my shoes back for an exchange, they failed and refunded me. I complained. They did not respond to my tweets, they took 5 days to reply to my FB...still waiting for them to reply on there. When I emailed they accepted that they had made a mistake but did not do anything to rectify it. I am now without the shoes. I brought 3 pairs of the shoes to be used at a wedding I am now 1 down. ASOS do not provide a telephone customer service so things are slow to be resolved and on email they just fob you off."
"June 27, 2016",5,A+ Everytime,ASOS is my go to online shopping destination. I have been utilising this site for many years now. I have purchased the premium subscription which entitles me to free express delivery and free returns (where a courier pick the package up from my door). Living in Darwin Australia means that mail is slow but witht he free express delivery i always receive my parcels within 7-10 working days. Love It!
"June 26, 2016",1,One of the worst and fake website ever experienced,Customer staff negative rating to them....negative rating to their commitments...DONT buy ...Dont Trust ....
"June 26, 2016",1,Poor Service delivery,"I place an order on ASOS on May 31,2016 with order number 207992601 and was notified to expectmy parcel on June 14, 2016.Usual delivery takes two weeks but i can't believe that till now i have not received my parcel. There was no track number to follow up with courier services so idecided to send a mail on June 21,2016 but no response and feedback. I also called customer line and head office at 3 pm on Thursday but no one picked nor returned my call..... This is really poor!"
"June 26, 2016",5,I'm shocked by all the negative reviews.,"I have just received my first ever order from asos , it arrived 4 days earlier than expected  even though I'm in New Zealand.  I got exactly what i paid for and am very happy. I will definitely use them again. The only thing I can say is that when ordering the boohoo or pink clove brand you need to order one size bigger than you might normally buy. Asos brand itself is very generous. Can't wait to buy more!"
"June 25, 2016",1,Tacky Thieves,They refuse to refund you the postage you paid for an item when you return it. They are breaking the law by doing this.
"June 23, 2016",5,"Great service, easy returns, helpful staff","Order a few items on ASOS, signed up for premier delivery and it came the next day. Had a problem on checkout entering my voucher code, once I contacted their support they helped me return the items I didn't want easily and then help refund me the difference missing my voucher code.Couldn't be happier!"
"June 21, 2016",1,Such a disappointment.,"I ordered 5 buttoned shirts for my fiance. I paid extra $25 for fast delivery. Not only I got my package 2 months (!!) late, I also got a payment demand with it asking me to pay about extra $100 (!!) as tax. I wanted to send it back but I gave up after dealing with their CS.Obviously I will never order from them again"
"June 21, 2016",1,Such a shame,"I like ASOS, I am a frequent customer and most of the time I am very happy with my purchases. However, my last few purchases have left me with such a negative experience all because of their poor customer service. I am aware that the margins are small on clothes and that I am not spending thousands of pounds, but I would still expect a better experience than this. I have received a better experience than this at other competitors, and I have never left a negative Trust Pilot review in my life before. My issue with the customer service is that they frankly do not respond. When they do respond, it's simply to say how busy they are and will get back to you soon. Days later, you have to follow up. Most likely, you'll receive the same response again. I ordered an outfit that I was supposed to receive last Friday. It still has not showed up, and I am still waiting for Asos to investigate and refund me if it's been lost. But because they're so busy, I am still waiting... while they have my money. If you look at ASOS Twitter you'll see my situation repeated over and over again. The sad thing is that I really don't think ASOS cares about how their brand comes across considering its displayed on such a public platform. Additionally, most companies know that the customer service department is the saviour of the company. They're supposed to make the bad stuff, good. But the sad thing is - with ASOS they actually tarnish the company. So moral of the story - shop at ASOS and you'll most likely like the clothes and fingers crossed nothing goes wrong because if you have to contact their customer service department, God forbid, you are screwed. Look at me. I'm still waiting."
"June 20, 2016",1,Appauling customer service,"I ordered several items for next day delivery and 5 days later am yet to receive the goods.  Since calling the day I should have received my order, Asos have fobbed me off reassuring me the parcel will be delivered the following day, they have taken the money (over £100) already from my account and I am still without my goods.  i am actually gutted at the service because before this I thought Asos was a genuinely great site but after this I will never shop here again and urge others not too, unless you want to spend most of your time chasing your order. It's ridiculous. I'm now going to spend tomo morn on hold for 45 mins again to now cancel my order and then have to wait 5 days for a refund and for what!? A waste of my time."
"June 20, 2016",5,Great service,Got the premium account and so far its hassle free next day service. Cant ask for more.
"June 20, 2016",1,NON SERVICE,"In this era of HIGH competition, all ASOS can do is lure you with excellent videos.  I tried to register for 5 days to take advantage of their last sale--completely unable to.  Their Facebook 'customer service' is a complete joke: hipster doubletalkers who sound like they're having a latte at Starbucks while checking posts.  They can offer NO credible help or solutions, they just blather on till you give up in frustration and go away.  It's a joke that such a seemingly successful company won't spend for the most basic customer service."
"June 20, 2016",5,Awesome,Bought over 10 things from here and haven't had a single problem! im surprised there is a lot of negative reviews about this site.
"June 20, 2016",1,Poor,"Very poor customer service, Slow, None responsive half of the time. As a business owner I would look at these reviews and do something about it !!!!"
"June 20, 2016",1,Slow service,"I ordered some stuff back in February but changed my mind and let the post office send it back. It's now June and I still haven't gotten my money back. I've written to them 2-3 times and everytime they tell me that they're working on it and will get back to me in 48 hours, but never do. I'm very unsatisfied...."
"June 19, 2016",1,"Rubbish Customer Service and rubbish refunds, even when it's their fault!","Fine if you keep everything you order but if you place several orders to compare items be prepared for your cash to be sitting Asos's account for up to 10 days. They cancelled 2 of my orders as an item was out of stock but took the money from my account anyway and only refunded when I got paypal to intervene. Every time you email - you can't phone there is no contact no. - a different person responds so you get nowhere. I'm now waiting for a refund for £185.00 and so far we are up to day 8 and still no sign of it. NOT IMPRESSED - love the things I have kept but will never shop with this company again, have only given 1 star as you can't give a no star rating"
"June 18, 2016",5,All Good,"My Maybelline contouring stick arrived quickly, well packaged & with a free Lynx sample. Would order again."
"June 17, 2016",1,Save yourself the trouble...,"I never write reviews however I wished I would have read others before purchasing from ASOS. After a month of trying to find the perfect maternity dress for my baby shower I settled on one from ASOS. Beyond excited they actually had my size I ordered the dress. The following day I received notice my dress had shipped and would be there within 4 days!!! Those days came and went and after 6 days I emailed their customer service for an update. Instantly I received a response asking questions ""to better help me"". After 6 days they still never responded again. I then choose to go onto Facebook only to find I'm not the only irritated customer, there's thousands..yes thousands! I publicly posted on FB and which a slew of private messages were exchanged but only after I publicly complained multiple times. After all the stalling and being told I need to ask my local post office, I received a message from the shipping department that the dress is out of stock and they can't replace the item and will refund my money. Basically they NEVER sent the item and wasted my time."
"June 17, 2016",1,Worst Customer Care experience ever,"Worst experience ever! No response to emails reporting a missing parcel. Had to go on Facebook and make a public post. Had some generic 'we're super busy' apology and promise to look into. Reported 23rd may, still no resolution by the 14th June. Received comments like ""if you return the goods we can sort your refund for you"", despite the fact the query was regarding a missing delivery!  Didn't bother contacting DPD - asked me to sort all of the tracking etc , even though DPD are contracted by ASOS. No phone number, contact with a human who can actually help is virtually impossible. Emailed the CEO in my frustration, he hadn't replied so I think it's a complete lack of regard from the top down! Get your house in order ASOS.com"
"June 17, 2016",5,Super!,"Always a good experience when I shop at Asos! Nice clothes, fast delivery and free returns!"
"June 17, 2016",4,Good experience for me,January 2016 I ordered some clothes from Asos and I had a good experience with them.Clothes were shipped on the next day and they were like I expected.Only downside was that the leggings that I ordered were not very good quality but they were so cheao that I did'nt expect that they would have been good quality.
"June 17, 2016",1,Complete RUBBISH,"No way to contact the company, keep getting replies likeWe care so much about your response, please check this FAQ but this mailbox is a robot  Bla bla"
"June 16, 2016",4,Terrific clothes,"i just received my 2nd order from ASOS. The 2nd order arrived a little later than what i expected, only because the 1st order was in my hand on 4days regular delivery. I received just what i ordered, the sizes run a lil smaller. I am a 2-4 regularly, but a good judge at sizing on-line. Keep up the great work and i will continue to order."
"June 16, 2016",2,Lost all faith,"Having shopped with ASOS for over 10 years now and a usual Premier Account holder, I am left disappointed by their current service. A lack of response on Facebook and emails makes me very nervous for my missing order. The one response I got felt very patronising; ""check with a neighbour"", like I hadn't done that already?My item was supposedly delivered when I was out, yet no delivery card was left to suggest this, nor did I receive the usual delivery notification email. When tracking my order on Hermes it would seem the item was left ""in a secure location"". If only I knew where said secure location was!! An order I placed 10 days before an event is now going to mean I don't get to wear the skirt I planned to and i'm left with no choice but to shop with a competitor. Not a happy bunny."
"June 16, 2016",5,Recent purchase,Very happy with my purchase. Beautiful jumpsuit. Fast delivery. I will purchase again from ASOS. 😊
"June 16, 2016",1,As bad as hell!,"I have been a loyal customer for over 5 years but lately I'm receiving the wrong items, orders take almost a week to be dispatched and worst of all no reply from Customer Care within a week (yet)!!! I am so disappointed with the after sale of ASOS, no such online store is as bad as ASOS!"
"June 15, 2016",3,No respond on my missing order e-mails,"I made an order and were told I would receive it on 13'th of june. I have send over 3 e-mails about my missing order but asos haven't made a respond! I have shopped on the site severel times, and never before have there been any problems (therefor 3 stars). I understand delays can occur, but that they obviousley don't care about informing their customers is just unrespectabel! Really hope for a respond soon, because I really love their side, and it would be sad if I'd feel the need to never buy from Asos again in the future..."
"June 15, 2016",4,5/6 Satisfied purchases made,"I've ordered from ASOS on a number of occasions, and they've all turned out good. Correct sizing, good quality, fast shipping. Basically, it's great until you encounter a problem and therefore need to approach the customer service - that's where it becomes a pain in the neck.My 6th and final order from them was an order I had really anticipated. It contained 5 items that I was eagerly hoping to try on, impressed by the previous 5 purchases. That order, never came. I contacted the customer service, and was each time, told to do the exact same thing of clarifying my address, checking with my neighbors, checking with my post office, by different employees. Clearly, for good customer service, clarifying once is enough. I usually keep my calm in situations of an order mishap because I understand it's hard to control so many orders and mistakes are bound to happen. However, I do expect prompt and sincere customer service when something goes wrong. I judge a company not by how good the products are - since some companies are basically resellers for other brands, but by the quality of their customer service. And the 6th order, the first encounter with their customer service, was the order that didn't make me want to return again.For a refund of £25 (that's not even a large amount, mind you), I waited 1 month for it. Of which, at least 3 weeks were wasted on clarifying and re-clarifying my address again and again, until I finally lost it and politely told the employee off. Only then, my refund started to process.Basically, if your order arrives in perfect condition, you're good. Just pray you don't ever have to come across their customer service."
"June 14, 2016",1,The worst customer care ever,I made the order and got brown loafers instead of black one. I tried to get back my money but for that I need to send back the loafers (which means to spend time and money) and only after that I can get back my money. But that was their mistake! I don't get why should I spend my money and time by sending back the wrong item. By the way the quality was good however I would not use this shop ever again and wouldn't reccomend it to anyone.
"June 14, 2016",1,So disappointed,"Merchandise is absolute crap.  Sooooo disappointed in the crap quality of this company!  One blazer ordered, terrible fit.  Tight under armpits but hung almost to my mid thigh.  Ordered according to their size chart but ordered a size bigger just in case-lot of good that did me when I can't move my arms in the blazer.Decided it was a fluke so I ordered a sequin top a month later.  Fit completely off just like the blazer but I wore it anyway🤗Washed it by hand and sequins fell off.  WHAT?Worst clothing company ever with a GREAT website.  I absolutely love the clothes but will never ever make the mistake of wasting $112.00 on two items I could of bought from China and would of lasted longer.Thanks ASOS!🖕"
"June 13, 2016",1,Horrible Customer care! They sent defective items to abroad.,"I ordered Steve Madden sandals. But sandals have not their original box and all over scratched, wrinkled, faded and one strap is fell apart then glued. I create 2 queries on their site. But no answer. I wrote message to Facebook. No answer. They haven't Live CHAT. And finally, I opened twitter account for this occasion. And I tried to chat whole night by twitter. But I can't get answer. I understand I must return 45 pound sandals for 47.7pound by DHL.  They said If.... We refund your return shipping cost.  Finally I'm possible to lost my return cost,  sandals price and sandals. OMG. ASOS is thief. Beware!!!"
"June 11, 2016",1,cheap is expensive,I bought two hats at asos and do not look like the photos on the website besides poor quality and bad termination! just horrible i never ! I will never buy in this store is as the saying cheap is expensive
"June 11, 2016",1,Package never arrived,"I ordered a Ralph Lauren sweatshirt for my boyfriend, but my package never arrived. I had a lot of trouble getting my money back. Not okay."
"June 10, 2016",1,Simply awful customer care,"I've been a customer for years to the point of paying for their premium next day delivery service. But my recent experience has left me wondering what is going on in the company. My ""next day"" delivery wasn't made (although they at first tried to allege that it was and then backed down), then they ""delivered"" by throwing the item over the back fence in the pouring rain. And we were on holiday for a week!When I complained I was told that I could get a refund or replacement (but there was no recognition that this wasn't acceptable and that I'd been let down). You can get a refund or replacement on a product as standard and I was told that this was, ""the only outcome that was possible"". No matter how many times I asked them to explain what had happened and why, they refused to answer my questions and told me that there was no way for me to escalate the issue. The product might be good, the service might be quick, but when things go wrong ASOS will leave you standing on your own and they simply don't care about you - no matter how long you've been a customer. Profits before service."
"June 10, 2016",1,Worst Customer Service I Have Ever Experienced,"I ordered $400 worth of merchandise with expedited shipping from them a few days ago. I then received an email stating that they were unable to process my order and that it had been canceled. Not only are they unreachable via email, but when they will tell to try to contact them via Twitter and Facebook which is just us useless. ASOS should be ashamed of themselves for actually referring to itself as a retailer. These people are scam artists and I'm not sure how they are actually in business."
"June 09, 2016",1,Terrible Customer Service,"If you're looking to buy an outfit for a special occasion don't bother... Their clothes are good quality I can't argue with that but the deliveries are shocking plus they seem to side with the courier company rather than yourself when confronted with ""I was home and no one came here to deliver"" they're answer is the courier said they have delivered and put it ""SOMEWHERE""  Customer service is practically non existent and very unhelpful."
"June 09, 2016",1,"Worst service, bad practice","I ordered an on sale jumper for $171. It has red and blue colour and a very nice diamond shape pattern. Three week later I received a completely different style ugly brown jumper with a new label (right one) stick on top of the brown jumper label. I went to their website and through a long process of notifying, sending them pictures of what I ordered and what I received, and returning the item (paid for postage first, refund later policy). To my amazement, they sent me back an exactly same wrong one. I again went through the same painful process. Any of my email were replied by different people but exact same patronising ignorant tone like sorry that you got wrong item, we will investigate. Finally they said 'there is stock issues' and refunded through PayPal.My postage cost of $21, however, they said can't be refunded through PayPal or voucher. I have to go to my account put in my credit card number as default card to get my money back. In the end I gave up my $21. To sum up, they advertised a product they don't have, then stick a fake label on some craps to send it off with the hope that their return process is too painful that people will give it up. I did not hear a word of apologise for bad practice, just excuses after excuses (stock issue??). This is my last experience with asos."
"June 08, 2016",1,worts customer service ever.,"Not only they don't answer, they don't have a number to call and there is no way to get your money back. My order was supposed to arrive 7 days ago THE MOST and I am here without a clue of where my package is. Don't shop here."
"June 08, 2016",5,Only love for ASOS,"This is my first review here and I had to write something since I've read more bad than good reviews on this site.I accidentally stumbled upon trustpilot.com, after already having two orders shipped from asos.com and asos.es just a couple of days before and I was honestly concerned about those. The orders didn't arrive exactly on time but I was paitent enough not to bother the customer service and decided to wait a bit more (it wasn't as easy as it seems) :) so eventually the orders did arrive and I'm very satisfied with the clothes and shoes (ASOS brand and VERO moda). I love ASOS! Everything fits me, quality is nice, only their ankle boots ('against the wind') are half a number bigger, nothing to stress about. However, the third order arrived on time.Since I am from Serbia, it usually takes a couple of days more or up to ten days for any order to arrive to my small town (seems that at customs clearance they keep packages longer than they should, so it's actually my country's fault if I don't get them on time).Hopefully ordering some more in the near future.Aleksandra R."
"June 08, 2016",1,Poor customer service,"I have been waiting over 1,5 months to receive my parcel. Very poor customer service, it takes up to 4 days to get a reply from the customer support and they do not provide any solution to the problem."
"June 08, 2016",2,Tracking Inaccurate,"My delivery date was today, when I logged on to check the status of my order (I have ordered dresses for a wedding I am attending), it said they had been delivered last night at 6pm. I knew there were people in the house then and was concerned so I rang customer service and was cut off twice, got through to head office and was told there were some problems and to ring back. Rang an hour later and after being on hold for about 25 mins, was told that the tracking system is regularly wrong and there is nothing that can be done about it! I have been told there is a delay on my order (which I hadn't been told about) and that I should ring back on Monday if it still hasn't come.... The customer service person spoke over me numerous times and was very defensive that I was asking questions about it..... not great."
"June 08, 2016",1,DON'T SHOP AT ASOS,i got an item for asos but returned it it cost about 400 pounds after 7 days past i email and call asos asking they form my refund they said the item is not been delivered to them and they will not refund me people don't spend any money on this company they will rip you off
"June 07, 2016",1,Do not order,Do not order from Asos. I have yet to receive my package or any updates as to where it is. I've tried to contact them numerous ways and have never gotten a response. It was suppose to be here June 3.
"June 07, 2016",1,Trash,I will never shop from asos again. Pure trash.
"June 07, 2016",1,Dreadful customer service,I ordered a dress for next delivery 6 days later it hasn't arrived and Customer Care have not replied to my email just disgraceful !
"June 07, 2016",2,Dreadful service when it goes wrong,"Asos sent me a £5 voucher, I used this and there was a high volume of traffic when I paid for the item so something went wrong their end, when I tried to do the transaction again the voucher was not accepted.I tweeted them, waited three days and got a response saying someone from IT would look in to it, as yet still nothing and it's been over a week. Customer service has gone downhill so much in the last year, to the point where unless you tweet them publicly, which I did, they don't care.  won't buy from them again, until I hear of improvements made to their customer service and response time, which is a shame as I bought nearly all my clothes there, will not be doing that from now on."
"June 06, 2016",1,"Incompetent, frustrating and useless!","Asos have sent me the wrong pair of shoes TWICE within a week. I went out my way to send back the first size 5 pair, only for two days later the same size 5 pair to get delivered AGAIN. I needed them for the weekend so ensured I got next day delivery, but TWICE I was sent the wrong order. Disgusting. When I finally got through to customer care all they could say was that they was a problem with the warehouse and that they were hesitant to send them to be again. They said they would chase this problem up yet it has been a few days and I have heard NOTHING. I am livid and frustrated with the lack of customer care."
"June 06, 2016",5,"Brilliant Setrvice, Great Company, Good to See Their Success","I started using ASOS back in the 90's when they first came to be and it's great to see what they have become.  They offer a fantastic range of clothing and shoes and a fantastic, same day delivery service.  Absolutely love ASOS!!"
"June 05, 2016",3,What a Journey,"I ordered a dress from asos for my prom. I had previously ordered a dress off another website but it went badly and as my prom was only a few days away I began to panic. Asos are a UK based company and so shipping to me would be quick, that is the main reason I chose to purchase from asos - because I was in a time crunch. I picked a lovely sequenced dress and due to the price of it, I was offered free next day delivery which was a god send for my situation. However, when I received the dress it was too big and so I asked customer service if an exchange would take long due to my limited time. They replied fairly quickly with the solution of buying the dress again but in the corrected size and getting a refund on the one that is too big. It was a Friday which meant not only would I have to wait until business days for the dress, it was also a bank holiday Monday meaning the soonest day I would receive my new dress was a Tuesday - only 2 days before my prom. As I had already purchased two dresses (the one from another website and the one from asos) using my mum's credit card (and prom dresses are expensive) my mum did not have enough money left in her bank account as it was the end of the month. My uncle gave me his credit card to use, however, as my uncle lives in a different location from where I had stated on my asos account (which is mandatory to purchase from asos) asos declined my purchase and locked my account, probably thinking I had stolen the credit card. They emailed me telling me to send them multiple forms of ID such as passports and bank statement proofs in order to unlock my account and continue my purchase. But I had no time for that lol. I made a new account at used my uncle's paypal to purchase the dress with the next day delivery offer again. It came in on the Tuesday still a little too big which I was surprised by as they have a sizing guide available online, and if following that, there was no chance at all of me fitting into anything lower than my original order. As I mentioned, the dress was sequenced and with every slight movement I could hear hundreds of little sequence bouncing off my floors, not to mention the fact there was a catch in the fabric and a burst button which I had to sew. Yet, the refund for the first dress from asos went by without a hitch and it was fairly quick. I also managed to get to prom looking cool in my dress :-) The end.Takeaways as this was so long lol:*Sizing guide has a fairly large leeway. (for me)*If you buy a sequenced dress, even from just trying it on you will be surrounded in a pool of sequence that have fallen off (they do provide a little bag of sequence to sew them back on though)*Quick and helpful customer service replies.*Very quick deliveries to UK.*Very good security against fraud lol.*Quick refunds."
"June 05, 2016",3,Alright...,"I like ASOS and they usually do things correctly, but these past two separate times that I've ordered from them, the packages have been delivered later than the date that was said when I first ordered it. The most recent was a belt I ordered on the 29th of May that was promised to be delivered on the 3rd of June. I was hoping to wear it to an event on the 6th but I got an e-mail saying I should wait for it to arrive on the 7th, which is when I kind of don't need it that much anymore. So, it was basically a waste of money for me. I'm not sure if it's the fault of ASOS or something else, but if this is gonna happen where I don't get a tracking number and it arrives approximately 4 days after the promised delivery date, then I am not confident in ordering online from this company. I like their clothes and their website but now it's like if I need to order something for an event I need to do it weeks earlier because I expect the delivery date to be delayed...that's not normal. If the shipping was free I would be less annoyed but, it wasn't."
"June 04, 2016",5,Don't understand all the bad reviews,"I've had great service from asos for the past three years. I've made about 20-30 orders in that time, and only once have I had any problems. That was when I received someone elses order, emailed asos to let them know and they sent out the correct stuff straight away.Sure, the quality can be a bit iffy sometimes with certain brands (I'm looking at you, ASOS homebrand!) and can be a little expensive, but that can be cured with the discounts codes they commonly have on and student discount rocks.Definitely one of the better retailers out there, that's for sure."
"June 03, 2016",1,TERRIBLE SERVICE,"I ordered trousers, received the wrong size.Then ordered again, and received a woemns bracelet.I've sent it back, but they claim they didn't receive it.So i lost 20£.When i contacted costumer service, i had a USELESS answer.Tried again, but they ignored."
"June 03, 2016",3,Great stuff; but very poor after care when it goes wrong.,I bought some shoes with ASOS for my birthday. They sent me some leggings. I bought another pair and sent the original parcel back. They sent more leggings. I have returned them as well. So far no refund and no shoes. I have repeatedly emailed them and had no reply. It's a shame as I generally like them but there are a lot of businesses out there.  Treating customers badly is never smart.
"June 03, 2016",2,Wrong item sent,"I am a fashion stylist and a loyal customer of Asos but this time is all going wrong. Not good.I ordered several items and bought a pair of stylish glasses from my favorite brand as ASOS must know and received a pair of ridiculous cheap bracelet instead. I am very frustrated since I had issue with my delivery and as I am myself working for a big luxury fashion company I am fully aware of those issue but it doesn't feel great, and I am so disappointed also to find the CC team email address I had to wing since on google it does not appear anywhere. Such a shame. Asos isn't as great as we do expect. Never ordered again with them. Mr Vandamme Loic"
"June 01, 2016",1,Terrible Customer Service,"BUYER BEWARE: I placed an order on ASOS a matter of hours before they did their %20 off deal. I contacted the customer service to see if they could amend my order to reflect the discount and they  flat out said no. They made zero effort to make up for this, and had the audacity to suggest I buy more things from their %70 off outlet. Terrible company to deal with. I will never purchase anything from this store again, and I would cancel my order if it hadn't already shipped. Consider shopping somewhere else."
"May 31, 2016",1,Poor customer service,"Recently tried to purchase a few items that my girlfriend bought online. Apparently was delivered to our flat but we never received this order after a good start with there customer service about resolving the issue they said to us we will get back to you in 48 hours ... Well 2 weeks later and a lot of blunt emails to them they never got back to us. Absolutely pathetic service they don't care about customers they just want to keep hold of your money ... I don't know what i would have done if it was a big £100 plus order I would be even More fuming with them ... But there not just to blame there delivery service  are just as incompetent we ordered a few more things while this case was on going and it actually turned up at our house and the same stupid driver that was meant to delivery our first order delivered this one . We questioned the driver who could not even get he's story correct  said ""I left your parcel with your neighbour "" total lie our neighbour never took delivery of our parcel , as she was in the back of the garden all afternoon she's a 70 year old lady who I can't see would play games. Then the driver later in the conversation   said ""I posted it through your letter box"" our letter box struggles to get letters through it let alone a parcel ... Never will I  order of them again useless service"
"May 31, 2016",1,Nope don't do it save your money and unnecessary pain and sufferance,I just had my first and Last shopping experience with ASOS! As the old saying goes if it's to good to be true it is the case! Deceptively untrue in my experience. As they sell good brands I was called into thinking they may be another great online option like The Iconic or Surfstitch but NO way ASOS has proved absolutely terrible in more ways than one! Start with the Customer Service- rate it at a 1 out of 10. Email them and expect a generic response that does not provide an answer let alone a solution or even any individual review of your case. Do expect a patronising ignorant reply. Eg click here and you will see a size chart! Oh really Sherloch you do not think I didn't look at size charts and reviews of show sizing before ordering 6 pairs of men's shoes?!So as for the shoes. Yep 6 pairs of them ordered each pair as per each males usual size. Ensured I knew their European size and their UK & US size. Looked online at customer reviews which mentioned ASOS shoes were tts.... We get the shoes and NOT one pair fit one person. each and every pair are TOO small this shows consistency. I write to ASOS and they suggest I look at size charts! Disgusting and disgraceful response!! What a joke. I shop online on a weekly basis and have only come across one or two as dreadful. Will not be back!!Oh and just to make matters even worse yes they can get worse....they do not exchange for compensation of their inconsistent Sizing.....nope refund and repurchase is the only option. So by the time you manage that chances are item will be sold out or in my case back up to FULL PRICE so not worth buying! As original was bought on sale!
"May 30, 2016",1,Terrible,Returns are always slow/ they make the most out of keeping your money for as long as poss. My last order was meant to be next day but it's 3 days late. No proper apology just 'sometimes these things happen' crap.
"May 30, 2016",5,Great,Fast shipping and nice cloths
"May 29, 2016",1,Never again,"Ordered two dresses 2 months ago.One of the dresses was wrong, I mean WRONG. They explained I had to send it back so that they could ship me the right dress.My postal services told me it would take 5 days max. for the dress to get there however asos asked for 21 business days so that they could process it in their warehouse. After more then 30 business days I sent an email trying to understand what was going on, costumer service told me they would look into it and get back to me in 2 days, a week later still no news, so again new email to asos, they replied saying the dress was sold out. Moral of the story, 2 months watting for a dress that never came. Thank you asos!"
"May 27, 2016",5,Asos are my go to!,"Wow I don't know why there are so many bad reviews for ASOS, I've been shopping on their site for years and have only ever had one wrong item delivered and they rectified it immediately without any issues so you cannot fault them. I do have ASOS premium which means I get my order the next day and I couldn't recommend it more, super cheap for an entire year and their site couldn't be easier to shop on. I love all the items and choice you get compared to the high street shops."
"May 27, 2016",1,Missing gift card,"I ordered a gift card 2 days ago and I still haven't received it.I have phoned twice and been told they are dealings with it.How hard can it be,just email to me."
"May 27, 2016",1,No Response,Received the wrong item which cost less than what I was suppose to receive when I returned the wrong item I was refunded for it rather than being refunded for the item I originally bought. Sent 3 contact messages to ASOS as this is the only way of making contact with them but no response to date.  VERY DISSAPPOINTED as a customer who shopped weekly off ASOS now I don't even look at their webpage.
"May 26, 2016",1,Declining quality of clothes,"Asos was always my go to whenever I needed an outfit that was affordable and good quality. But recently (2-3years), I never seem to get the same quality. I really do hope they improve on quality and I'll be back."
"May 26, 2016",1,Wrong item and worst feedback ever,I've ordered joggers and they send me horrible sweatpants and also they forgot to put their sticker for refund. After they promise me to make compensation for post return and an item...  they just payed me € 3.17 for joggers and started to ignores me. Why € 3.17? I've made order with their promo code (when you buy for a €150-€200 and get €25 off) and they just taking out €25 euro of Joggers price... Great refund and Worst. Feedback. Ever.
"May 25, 2016",1,POOR QUALITY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Cant't stop my angry about how Asos provided customer service. I placed  an order  online in middle of March, however  I haven't recieved the good yet. In the first time, the order probably missed or other problems, but the point was that nobody informed me any information about that. Asos missed the expected date and the expended date. This is the last chance I gave them. One staff from customer service team told me that they would carry out a express delivery to place my order within four days. That was not sure. They cheat me every time. Asos replaced the order as STANDARD delivery without informing me AGAIN. I could not explain how disappointed I was and my angry. The customer service team doesn't care about ANY customers. I called in to require a FULL REFUND, the staff didn't follow the permission to call me back. The Asos doesn't have official compliant procedure provided, no contact number. It can not solve any problem at the first point. Until I receive the t-shirt, but there were TWO HOLES on it. The website and even the business is not trustworthy. Moreover, when I look information online, a number of people have already had SIMILAR EXPERIENCE as me. NEVER AND NEVER WILL USE ASOS AGAIN."
"May 25, 2016",1,Wrong item,Ordered two dresses but received one dress and a horrible pair of shorts. So it is apparently  now my responsibility to go out of my way to return these shorts to them in order for them to refund me the dress!!(the dress I ordered is now out of stock believe it or not!! - probably why I've been sent shorts!!). so I've emailed and tweeted and as a gesture of goodwill they willl give me 10% off my next order!! As if I'd ever order with them again! They do not understand that I chose to buy online because I don't have time to go out shopping but now I have to go out anyway...
"May 24, 2016",1,Worst experience ever,"I ordered a pair of jeans size 30/32 when i open the package i see that they send me 32/30 after that i decided to check their site and know what?The site says that they even out of stock for this sizeNow i have to wait till they get my returned items,than for a refund and that all because of their fault Will never ever ever do business with themWorst company👎🏻"
"May 24, 2016",4,Mixed feelings,"I love ordering from ASOS because they have a lot of different things - though I think the new things about returns for danish customers is kinda annoying. When you have to return something very heavy or large it's nice, but when it's small things it's really annoying. Now you have to go to ASOS and fill out a form which means that the return costs will always be 63 DKK (or around that), when before you would just pay the cost at your local post office, meaning that you often just got away with paying around 30 DKK."
"May 24, 2016",5,Excellent online clothing store,"Out of at least 20 purchases I've now run into my first problem ever when buying from asos.com.During check-out, that is, during payment, an item was removed from my shopping bag. This did not appear anywhere, not even during payment where I agreed to pay for both items and as a result, the shipping was free. However, since one item was removed without me knowing about it, I lost this one, and also had to pay shipping for the other item.I contacted asos about this and eventually had the issue solved. It took me 7 emails over 6 days, which would by far not land them in the 5/5 star category when it comes to customer service, however, I will say this:- The responses from customer service came very fast- I did not once feel forgotten or treated unfairly- My issue was handled very professionally- Customer service was understanding and did actually look further into my issue, eventually finding the errorI think an advice would be to be a bit persistent when it comes to customer service. It is also important to understand that they need all the information you have before they can help you. I do think if I had been clearer in my first email, it would've taken less time to solve my issue.In conclusion: So, with that said, my issue solved, and my twenty other successful purchases, asos lands on a 5/5 rating in my book."
"May 23, 2016",1,Useless customer service,"I have been using ASOS for many years. I love the versatility of the clothes and that it cares for unusual tastes. However, in recent years their customer services are abysmal. Here's my last shopping experience.I ordered on Sunday before 5pm for next day delivery. ASOS app showed my delivery as next day (Monday 23rd) which was what I needed as I am going on holiday on Tuesday and I needed some last minute items. Order was placed successfully and paid for. A few minutes later I received a confirmation email which I didn't thoroughly read. Today, after seeing my order has not been dispatched I checked the confirmation email and it says my order will arrive on Tuesday! The confirmation email was received at 5pm (showed them email screenshot) which proves my order was placed before 5pm. I contacted customer services to complain and ask them to stop order as nobody will be here to receive parcel and my neighbours have stolen parcels before. I will not be back from my holidays until mid June and the parcel can't be left out for three weeks. I was told they've packed it so they can't stop it even though it's still at their warehouse. If they deliver the order which has not even been dispatched yet and it gets stolen/lost who will be held liable? I asked them to stop the order at 7am. The order was dispatched at 4pm. They couldn't have stopped it in 9 hours? Even though it was their website's fault?I think this is where I stop giving them my money."
"May 22, 2016",5,Amazing shipment options,"I have just received ASOS shipment in Qatar (POBOX does not exists here) where I usually have to pay min 50 pounds for international forwarders. I ordered items on 16-May evening, shipped out on 18-May, received on 22-May. Because my order costed more than 20 pounds the international shipment was for free, collection from Aramex/ShopandShip in Doha I paid 2 pounds for admin charges. That is all. Package was 2,5kg. AWESOME!I will shop with ASOS only from now on :-)"
"May 22, 2016",2,You suck!,I need to return an item and have written to you to customer service with some questions.I have been waiting over a week for a reply and I'm starting to get really pissed. Get it together.No customer care in this business.
"May 22, 2016",1,Worst customer service,"I have called this morning to let them know about a voucher code hat I should have recieved on my birthday is still yet to arrive, I spend over £200 a month on Asos and have been an Asos a list customer so I was think I'd deserve the voucher code! Unfortunately I spoke to some little crettin who laughed at me and then refused to let me speak to anyone else and then wouldn't let me be transferred to a manager before cutting the phone call off! Asos has he worst customer service of any company I have come across! I have had things delivered weeks late things delivered with blood all over them and things missing from orders and it's a struggle every time for them to do anything about it!"
"May 21, 2016",2,Customer Service & Tracking Service is Extremely Frustrating.,"A little over a year ago I stopped shopping at asos due to an issue in returning an item that they had shipped a size that was different than what I had ordered. The whole process of returning the mis-sized item was a headache, but in order to not be charged for that item as well as one in the correct size, I had to figure out a way to get it back to them. I hadn't placed an order with asos in over a year, but then recently decided to give them another shot. The item I ordered did not arrive by the date that I had been told it would be delivered ""on or before,"" so I reached out to customer service, who said to wait a few more days to see if it gets delivered. Due to the lack of tracking service, they weren't sure why it hadn't been delivered. I want to like this company, I can always find clothes there that I love, but I would rather not have to sit on my hands and wait to see IF my order will arrive because there is no way for me or them to track the shipment."
"May 21, 2016",1,Only OK if you do not need to return items,"I've been a longstanding customer of 6 years and have ordered massive amounts of clothes here. My last order in April did not please me so I've returned it AND they confirmed receiving it by mail. After a total silence of 3 weeks, no refund (over €200!!!) And so it begins, I need their customer service, which reply the same every time, asking for order numbers, which I gave but they simply keep on asking them. After 5 emails they asked me for 1,5 months worth of bank statements with all amounts visible, also the non-asos related amounts. (is that even legal?)Surely they can see if they refunded a customer or not, why do I need to PROVE myself? Bad service, and only reachable by mail. By reachable I mean they answer you no more than once a day."
"May 20, 2016",1,Next Day Delivery Failed To Arrive until week later! - ASOS didn't care,"I've always found ASOS to be a great site to buy from with good choice of clothing, prices and delivery.Things appear to have changed since they now use a variety of couriers.Placed an order for next day. The courier, Hermes, stated it had been posted through letter box, which it had not. I emailed ASOS customer services and got no reply. I used ASOS online chat and was assured they'd get back to me and resolve it! And you guessed it no reply!!!Resorted to having to use Twitter to express my grievance and ASOS customer service yet again failed to take action.I was made to feel that I was in the wrong by ASOS, and that the courier was in right just because they stated they'd delivered it.With no communication from ASOS a week later!! My next day delivery arrived on a Sunday by the same courier that claimed they'd delivered it a week earlier!!!Very disappointed in ASOS for their lack of customer service. For me It would appear if you want reliable delivery and good customer service ASOS is no longer the site for me!!!As a customer of ASOS for over 10 years its very sad that I to write a review like this - I don't normally do this type of thing, but I feel this is only way ASOS will final get the message they failed"
"May 20, 2016",2,Plus sizing way off.,"I ordered 2 occasion dresses recently and the sizing was terrible. According to asos's own size guide I'm somewhere between a UK size 20 and 22. The last dress I ordered was a size 22 but my size 14 daughter struggled in to it. I then ordered the same dress in a UK 24 and 28 (26 was out of stock) and the 28 fits! I'm not bothered about the size label on clothing but having to go up 3-4 sizes is ridiculous! The dress is beautiful albeit very creased on arrival so I'm keeping it as it's for a special occasion but I'm not exactly satisfied with asos. The dress I before this one was the same but bigger sizes were out of stock so I couldn't reorder. How can I keep shopping with asos unless I start ordering 4 sizes of the same item at a time to check for the fit? Very poor asos, very poor."
"May 19, 2016",4,Super fast dispatch,And consistently good customer service
"May 18, 2016",4,"If you choose the right items, this website is the best","Some clothes I got from ASOS were amazing. Great prices, amazing quality and cool styles. Some on the other hand were poorly made, and didn't fit quite nicely. I learned that it's the best to get many items, try them on then return items that you don't like. Return takes a bit longer than I expected but the process is so easy!"
"May 18, 2016",5,"Fast Shipment, good prices","I ordered a couple of things to Denmark on a sunday and I received my package only a few days later - which was surprisingly fast. The items didn't suit me and I had to return them. The process was easy, fast and less than 10 days later my refund is on my bank account. Well done ASOS :)"
"May 17, 2016",2,How does a company not provide a tracking number?,"The first time I ordered from ASOS was so easy, and I loved the bathing suit I purchased. The second time I ordered a dress I needed for a wedding function. Somehow ASOS couldn't provide me with a tracking number. They claimed it was the shipping method I paid for (standard shipping), but I had used the same shipping on my first order and received a tracking number.From the time I ordered the dress to when I was issued a refund was two weeks. After the arrival date passed, ASOS customer care asked me to wait an additional four days for it to show up. They also asked me to check with my neighbors and at my local post office for the package. As a company, you should know where my package is through a tracking number. Not only did I have trouble getting my refund, but also getting in touch with customer service was a horrible experience. I emailed and sent DMs on Facebook just to get my refund. The email I received back said it would take 5-10 days for the refund to appear on my card. So now I'll see how long it takes to get my money back. I will never order from ASOS again."
"May 17, 2016",1,Absolute Bull,This was the worst experience buying clothes online I have EVER had. They never contacted me on their own for my return even WEEKS after I sent in a return request. When they finally did get in touch with me they offered to refund only a single item out of the 4 I returned. Horrible customer service. Horrible experience. Quite frankly their clothes are of poor quality too.
"May 16, 2016",3,"Great product, average website, poor customer service.","I've shopped at ASOS for years and have been usually pleased with their products. There are a few issues, though, that are completely frustrating with the website and communication. First, although I've had a longstanding account, it bothers me to no end that items stay in my shopping cart for only an hour.  If one has an account, the cart should have the same status as a wish list;  the last huge order I made I had to re-enter the items individually 4 times because I wasn't finished making up my mind.  Very silly. Also, with the last two orders, the wrong date was given for delivery, which may be a glitch with the delivery company, but ASOS should be on top of those issues.  I placed an order for 2-day delivery, and the tracking showed that it would be another month before I received my order. The next order showed that the delivery month would be October!  In my panic and inability to contact customer service in time (needed items for multiple events) I re-placed the order, which caused double delivery close together and an unnecessary hassle and cost. ASOS, please improve your website to include customer service chat, etc.  Overall, I will continue to shop here since I love the product, but customer service needs vast improvement."
"May 16, 2016",2,Customer service is poor,"I emailed about a faulty hoodie that I recieved, only to get a response 3 days later(which was not too much of a concern) and they said they would send me a replacement, as I had requested. Satisfied, I returned the item early the next day, including that it was faulty and that I wanted an exchange on the sheet provided. Later that same day, I recieved an ASOS package-great- except they had sent me the wrong item. I emailed again, explaining i'd been sent the wrong item but that I still wanted the replacement of the hoodie, they replied 4 days later apologising for the confusion and that they would 'definitely get this sorted' for me and send the hoodie. The next day, I got another email saying the hoodie was out of stock and to send the faulty item back- clearly they don't read any previous emails as I had already said I'd sent it back, mentioning I wanted to exchange it. Now I have to email again to ask for a refund as I don't want any other items on their site, as they suggested. Its taken over a week to sort this out and the issue is still not resolved, multiple emails have gone back and forth with a different person every time. Not what you would expect from a respected company like ASOS."
"May 16, 2016",1,customer service is the worst! Never shop here again!,I have been a customer for quite a while that's why I had no problem ordering from here. I ordered a blouse and never received the item I've been emailing customer service and I've gotten no response. I guess they just stole my money because I definitely never got my order! This boils every fiber in my body I hate when you can't even call a company and ask them about your order and when you email them you get no response they should be shut down. This is ridiculous be aware if you order from them it's a toss up if you'll get your items.
"May 15, 2016",5,Great,Nothing wrong. Got it in time and everything fit me. Great quality.
"May 14, 2016",1,Theft! Invisible customer service & highly incompetent staff,Sent wrong item twice. Refused to give a refund until the wrongly sent items have been returned at further my inconvenience.Over a month on they still have my £ & refuse to resolve the issue. Reported to trading standards.
"May 14, 2016",1,Not delivered. Still awaiting a refund 3 weeks later.,"I ordered goods on 30/04/16.  ASOS claim that Royal Mail delivered the parcel but there was no one home, the parcel was too big for the letterbox and RM did not obtain a signature - where was the parcel left???I have been going around in circles with ASOS customer service ever since, different people all the time.  I am hoping that PayPal will be able to retrieve my money from them.  Terrible experience and I will never use them again."
"May 13, 2016",5,Great service!!,"why so many bad reviews?? This site is great, with fast service and delievery, even to denmark!"
"May 13, 2016",1,SCAMMERS! SNOBS! IMPOSSIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!,"Let me tell you about ASOS. You try them out. You skeptically order one or two items to test the waters, see how that goes. They arrive in a reasonable amount of time. Those items just happen to fit, well enough anyway (miraculously). Yay! So now you have created an ASOS account and they're sending you emails. They don't offer as many discounts NEARLY as often as their competitors, like Boohoo (which I only have good things to say about and would highly recommend over ASOS a million times over). But behold, one day you get a promo code for $70 off a $250 order from ASOS! A bit much to spend, but how often does that kind of deal come around for ASOS, right? So you do it. You buy $250 worth of clothes and save $70. Yay! Then they arrive. I ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE there WILL BE returns that need to be made. Never have I shopped somewhere with such INCONSISTENT SIZES! This XL is smaller than that Large, but those 34"" shorts are tighter than these 28"" pants, and...you get the picture. So now, you have to send half of that big $250 order back for the correct sizes, BUT WAIT! You CAN'T exchange the items for the correct sizes? No way to do that whatsoever. You HAVE to take a refund for your returns. Now, guess what happens to that $70 discount, that you had to spend $250 just to get...it goes BYE-BYE! They take it right back out of your refund. So let's say you had to return $93 worth of clothes that didn't fit. A week or two later, they refund you $23. WHAT? WAIT! You just SCAMMED me into spending $250, just to get a $70 discount, only to have you guys TAKE IT RIGHT BACK?? I didn't want a refund IN THE FIRST PLACE! I just wanted to adjust the sizes appropriately after trying them on! I mean, if this size 30"" fits like a 34"", I guess I need a 26"", for my 32"" waist, makes perfect sense right?? Umm... Customer service, PLEASE HELP ME FIX THIS! Hahaha! ""Sorry, you should have read the Terms and Conditions."" Translation: ""Due to some fine print nobody actually reads, we don't have to make this right, so we're not going to."" Better translation: ""F*** off, we already got your money!"" Well guess what ASOS, basically everything you have to offer can be found at Boohoo or ELWOOD Clothing, among many others, for a MUCH better price. Not to mention they offer better deals and discounts WAY more often than ASOS. And I've personally needed customer service from Boohoo and they handled the issue so pleasantly, I never even had to be rude once. Anybody who reads this is going to check out those sites I just vouched for and find out for themselves they are better in every way. Maybe once you lose enough customers you'll try harder to hang on to the ones you have. That is, if you can stop being snotty little bit----, never mind, I've said my piece, no need to be ugly about it."
"May 12, 2016",5,Life saver,Always there for me when i need some clober
"May 12, 2016",1,"The worst customer service ever, never refunded the money","I wrote 3 (!) mails to their customer service concerning my return. Nobody ever replied. As soon as they hear something they do not like, they just totally ignore you. This is very sad as I have bought a lot of stuff from them and really like the clothes they sell. I never got the money for my last return though, which I have never experienced before with other companies. Never gonna order again!!!"
"May 12, 2016",5,I read through all of the reviews but gave them a shot anyway... because...,"Well.. They have some pretty sweet clothes. I had been shopping for my wife and stumbled across Asos. Like any good consumer, these days, I checked out their reviews. I found some really good reviews sprinkled in among some pretty horrid ones. But they had some really nice items, so I did what any guy would do, fell in my sword and bought something for myself first, just to try them out.I got something manly for about $50 and waited to see what would happen. One of the big negatives I read about was packages disappearing. Just never arriving and their tracking information would just vanish. Well, I got 4 emails about the shipping status, including one advising that the package was hung up in US Customs in Elizabeth NJ (I live in New Hampshire, US). I have to say, because of the reviews I was hitting the tracking site 10-15 times a day. To my horror, shock and amazement, my package came just as promised. Perfect shape and in this nice little shopping bag like mailer.Next concern was the quality of the product. I had read that Asos brand clothes were cheap and poorly constructed. I don't know... Maybe I got lucky, but my item is very nice. Quality material and solid construction. No loose threads or anything. I think I got a great deal at $50 (and free shipping).  In any case, I have a shopping cart full and look forward to seeing my wife in some of Asos great fashions.Do your homework and read all of the reviews, but I think Asos is the real deal. Give them a try like I did. You might be pleasantly surprised, in this world of scam every second internet retailers, that there is a good online store out there."
"May 11, 2016",1,worst customer service ever,nobody replies if they dont like what they hear
"May 11, 2016",1,Fancy clothing but rubbish service!,"Rubbish costumer service, postage time takes days, clothes are always out of stock even if you have baught them they email you about a week later. Poor costumer service .. Pricy too"
"May 11, 2016",5,Always a pleasure!,Nice one best one!
"May 11, 2016",1,Forget about Customer Service,"First and last experience with this company.  I am an international customer currently living in Canada, wanted to return an item and tried many times to get in touch with Customer Service: email, phone and chat.  There is not such a department; a couple of weeks after emailing them and no answer.  On the phone, no matter what time during the day you call (I've tried already 9 times in the last couple of days), same.  Asos is rubbish, an absolute disaster.   I will never use it again.  If you've got a problem with the items received, no one will be there to help you in your return/refund transaction.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
"May 10, 2016",2,Really bad service and long wait time,"I have been waiting almost a month, for 1 little jacket. I bought the jacket and when i arrived the jacket had a burnt shoulder, and burn marks all the way down the back of the jacket. We sent it back and now its been around 2 weeks since we heard from them the last time. Really bad service and very long wait time.I have my grandmothers funeral in a few days, where i was supposed to wear it and it is a very big deal to me, and because of ASOS really bad service i now have to wear a really big winter jacket to me beloved grandmothers funeral. Good job ASOS. You're the best. (IRONIC)"
"May 10, 2016",1,Gone down hill big time,"I have shopped from here for many years but lately it's become a really rubbish shopping experience, last I ordered a pair of boots sent me wrong size upon returning it back I had 4 customer care stuff sent me email asking the same thing over and over again called them many times wasted nearly 30 mins no joy. Really really rubbish service they have now......regardless the past bad experiences I had like never receive your delivery"
"May 10, 2016",1,Never got the delivery,"After 2 months of ordering some things on their website l am still waiting for it to arrive! I have send them seceral emails and every time someone different replies and asks me to tell them again what happened, they keep asking me to confirm my adress whilst my adress is correct. Today l finally gave up and asked for a refund. Hopefully they are better at refunds than at deliveries"
"May 09, 2016",1,NEVER BUYING FROM HERE AGAIN,"Bought some shorts from there as was found to be broken. Got them exchanged for new ones, but they were also broken. I have no printer and must travel far to give it to the nearest post office. Therefore, it is very bothersome for me. I wrote it to them, but they did not care. I then wrote to them I wanted my money back because I did not dare get them exchanged for new ones if they were broken. I still have not received my money.This is the last time I buy with them. This is unacceptable."
"May 08, 2016",5,Best online shopping experience,"I am an ASOS customer for a few years and it never disappointed me. I am very surprised of the low rating, because ASOS it is to me a trustworthy online shop. I always catch up some great deals, especially on shoes. What I like the most is that I can find good quality leather shoes on sale, with a unique design and very different from what you can find in stores."
"May 07, 2016",4,Great but....,"I'm from Mauritius.The good thing about Asos is that I received my order 1 week before it was supposed to arrive. But the bad thing is that I was disappointed when I saw the average quality of the fabric and that it was made in China, it's still pretty though!"
"May 06, 2016",1,Avoid!,"They charged me 3 weeks ago, sent the following email claiming they delivered it (I have no idea to whom if ever) and now ""investigating"" it. Firstly they asked 48 hours, then another 2 working days, now another 3 working days and totally refuse to process the refund I keep asking them to do. Never ever I will shop with them again."
"May 06, 2016",5,Always a good experience,"I have used Asos many times and am always impressed by the service, price and speed of delivery. I recently ordered a large selection of clothes to boost my summer wardrobe and it came the next day even though I ordered it on a Sunday night."
"May 06, 2016",1,wrost place to shop online ever,People don't ever try to think to buy from this site..they will steal your money and won't send you your stuff! They use the cheapest post office delivery with no track numbers or confirmation messages or costumer service even!!!they took my money and didn't send my stuff and I didn't know how to contact them to get help neither got any unfo about my order to look into it ..bad bad bad seller
"May 05, 2016",4,Love asos,Asos is perfect website for shopping. 4 stars only because they promote free worldwide shipping but actually it is free up to 30 euros. Not fair though
"May 04, 2016",1,WORST SHOPPING EXPERIENCE EVER! DO NOT BUY ANYTHING!,"This must have been the worst shopping experience ever.First they advertise with free shipping, then they charge you shipping fees anyways and on top of that they do not deliver the product. The Link they send out which supposedly helps you tracking your order tells you for weeks that your order is about to reach, but it does not. After weeks I contacted customer service which simply offered me to cancel my order - without any apologies or special offers! This must be the worst service I have ever experienced. I would not be surprised if it is going to be struggle to get my money back! Never again. My advice: Stay away from this company. As far as you can!"
"May 04, 2016",5,Surprised at bad Reviews,Have been shopping with ASOS for years - if the quality is not as I want - rarely- it's returned and easily done so. Trustworthy site for me!
"May 03, 2016",1,Worst costumer service,There is basically no way to get in touch with a real person in customer service. Only pre-written 'help questions'. Bad company!!!! *Not recommended*
"May 03, 2016",1,Worst online shopping experience EVER.,"I ordered a shirt with this company on March 25. Once the delivery date that ASOS gave me passed, they asked me to wait another 2 weeks because of shipping delays. Well now its been an additional week and the shirt hasn't arrived. They won't respond to any of my emails or messages to let me know what is going on. How can this company still be in business? If you can, save yourself the trouble and find other, more reputable site to order items from. Never again ASOS!"
"May 03, 2016",3,okay but not the most friendly,"I used to shop of ASOS.com quite often because they offer free international shipping on all their orders. (althought it is VERY slow, Im ok with it since it is free)The plus side is that shipping has always arrived within the time period they promised, and sending back items or getting refunds are relatively quick and painless. The down side is that because they are such a huge company and their system is so mechanized, there is not much help you can get from their customer services. So when something irregular happens, it is a pain to try to communicate this problem and I got the impression that in most cases they are not willing to accomodate. In their defense I've only had that irregular thing happen once due to their server not applying my promo code on my order but in the usual cases everything is so mechanized that there is not much room to fuss over. Because they carry so many brands sizing is difficult and while their products tend to be cheaper, in my opinion it also compromises their product quality."
"May 03, 2016",1,TERRIBLE SERVICE,"I ordered a dress on March 31 for a wedding I had in April. I still have not received my order and its May 3. ASOS customer care keeps telling me to ""wait"". Wait for what? Clearly my order is not coming. Why the hell is it taking over a month? I called my post office and they have no pending shipments for my name/address nor are there any postal delays. What am I ""waiting"" for? I shop online a lot, especially outside of Canada and I have never experienced this issue before. I will never shop here again!"
"May 02, 2016",5,Excellent online shop,"I do a LOT of online shopping and it is safe to say, that ASOS by far is my favorite online shopping site. It is so easy to use, has a huge range of clothing, skincare, makeup, etc. and I love that they have video catwalks - it really helps when you have to choose a specific size.I have made a lot of orders from them the last couple of years and I have always been satisfied. Once, a package never arrived, which is obviously not their fault. The parcel was tracked and I could see where it was, and somehow it got lost in one of the sorting facilities in Denmark. However, they sent me the item again which I think is excellent service.The items have also ALWAYS arrives on time, in accordance with the estimated delivery time, which is great!The only thing that I'm kinda sad about, is the fact that I cannot buy/send nail polish to Denmark (or Faroe Islands) and I really don't understand why x)It is easy to forget to let company's know if their services are good (people tend to only post about the bad experiences), but here is my long awaited review."
"May 01, 2016",4,good company,all went ok with them!
"May 01, 2016",5,Great Costumer Care,"I dont usually review hotels, things or companies even though it should be turnt into a habbit becuase its for our own good. The second reason i order in Asos its beacuse i know that for any problem that may arise(online shopping to some countries) they are going to take care faster then you think. I love the way they answer me, and how they are with me during a long ride while Im a regular costumer since 2 years."
"May 01, 2016",1,Wrong delivery address,"I order some items of asos and was expecting them to arrive yesterday between 6-5. I might of been out so I left a 'safe place' where the could leave it.I received nothing. This morning I tracked my items and it has been signed for by another person. They said I was out and that they left it with my neighbour. They didn't leave a deliver card because of our dog. (We don't have a dog) Turns out it also hasn't been signed for. And to top it off the time they say It was delivered, I was at home.So worryingly they have managed to deliver my items to a complete wrong address"
"April 30, 2016",1,Horrible customer service,"I was so happy that I managed to snag the last size in a pair of boots online, however when they came they were faulty (the material peeling back on the fastening), AND they arrived with dirty socks in them!!I messaged them on social media to complain and there resolution was to give me 10% off for next time. I explained I get this already with student discount, and they couldn't replace the boots as they were out of stock. I completely understand they can't majic boots out of no where and asked if I could have a partial refund back for the fault in the boots as I would keep them since I'm not able to get a replacement. The answer was a very RUDE keep them full price or send them back. I work in retail and we would NEVER treat our customers this way and comprimise an outcome so it benefited the customer. I WILL NOT be shopping with you anytime soon, you are RUDE."
"April 29, 2016",1,These people will not refund shipping for my return of a faulty item,"I have sent ASOS emails for about a month now because I was sent faulty shoes (literally had a huge dent and were scratched) and was told that if I sent them back, they would refund the shipping costs. The shipping was almost $36. The shoes were $31. I paid more for shipping than for the faulty shoes. As of lately they have ignored my emails regarding my refund. I will never be ordering from these people again and I will be taking legal action for lying to me and basically stealing my money."
"April 29, 2016",1,Wasted my time. Ordered EU45 they insist I ordered UK11(=EU46),"So I ordered a trainers. According to ASOS it is size UK 10.5 (on the left column) being equivalent to size EU 45. Doesn't really matter what UK size it is, as what I put with my order is in EU sizing. In my confirmation email and order record, it says EU 45. Never mentioned the UK equivalent. But what I received was a size UK 11 = EU 46 clearly stated one the trainers. It's a birthday present so I ended up placing another order (yes so that the birthday present was late), and because EU 45 is sold out I ordered EU 44.5 (UK10). It comes as “UK 10, FR 44.5”. Perfect. Glad that it still kinda fits. And I request refund plus require ASOS to pay for the postage. They said ""I've taken a closer look into this for you and checked your confirmation e-mail which shows that you have ordered a UK11 which is the equivalent to EU46, I'me managed to attach a copy of our size guide to this e-mail."" The size guide says UK11=EU46 that's true. SO?I ORDERED EU45. IF YOU CARE ABOUT UK SIZE, IT IS 10.5 ACCORDING TO THEIR TABLE.  My order says I’ve ordered EU45. On these two pairs of shoes I’ve received (original order and the replacement shoes) it clearly says FR 46. I understand the difficulty in converting sizes and different design of shoes may be different. As a customer the first thing I’d like when ordering online is to receive what I’ve ordered, then even if it doesn’t fit me I’ll still be happy to exchange for another size. Some ASOS CS is nice - offered replacement with express delivery - the only problem is that it is ALSO a EU46... I did appreciated that. Some CS are rude. I sent them a long email explaining everything and they seems don't brother. I cannot stressed more that EU45 is all I've ordered so how can they still insist that I've ordered a UK11!?!?!? I spent my time giving advise, suggestion, trying to be as patient and accepting as possible. All fail. Bye ASOS."
"April 29, 2016",3,Something wrong with the sizes.,"I orderd a dress from asos in a size 32, and got a dress marked size 32 but it was far too big, it must have been a 38 at least. I like the webside so much with the free delivery and return, but there is something wrong with the sizes."
"April 29, 2016",4,Shopping online is always risky - Take the good with the bad,"I honestly love this site, especially that they offer plus size items that are actually cute! I've been ordering randomly for the past few years and 5 out of 6 times (not including 2 returns that went fine as well) everything went smoothly from placing the order to delivery. The only time I had a problem, I was sent a different item than the one I purchased. The order numbers were very similar & so were the dresses so hey, I get it, things happen. I sent it back and tried again. I don't understand the negative comments about the customer service either. I sent a message on facebook asking about when an item would be restocked and I received a reply almost instantly. They are a huge, overseas online company, like many other clothing sites are, so of course things are bound to go wrong when massive amounts of orders are processed every day. There will ALWAYS be a risk when ordering anything from any site. You just have to cross your fingers when you click to place your order that everything will be delivered accordingly. All in all I've been happy with ASOS. I will continue to order from them :)"
"April 28, 2016",5,Best customer service and great site to order!!,"I am addicted to ASOS, they will solve your problems in 24 hours and their premier delivery is so good and totally worth it!! Never had a problem with ASOS!!"
"April 28, 2016",1,Roulette with orders,"Well I have been using asos for years. They use this delivery company called dpd. And for the last 2 weeks all items have been going to a different COUNTY for pick up. Once you email asos and wait for about 4-12 hours for a response from a different person each time, they will say not our problem, we cant change the delivery and it was you who did it.  While i have used the premier service for years, waiting two weeks to not receive my item and then process refund is a joke"
"April 26, 2016",1,2 orders - 5 defective items !,"What can I say... I ordered a lot things in the past,  that was a wonderful times, where asos can do a refund so quickly and yeasy ( for defective items).Today I got 2 of my new orders. 5 items from the orders - defective. I can't wear them !!! Horrible condition shoes, clothes  & accessories are send to me as a new ones. Ive payed for them alot of money.  So, after 2 days of trying to have any answer from the asos, they said - we can make a refund after we get all these items !!! WHAT ??? And, so, ASOS, you will put all these stuff back in the shop, and the next looser like me will pay for them to got these super cool defective stuff ????? All will send back to you, ASOS, ok. But my next trouble will be - where is my money & why I can't get my money back , yea, ASOS, realy ??? NEVER !!! I SAD NEVER WILL GO TO THE ASOS !!! DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM !!"
"April 25, 2016",5,Trustworthy place,"I've placed order several times with ASOS and they are 100% trustworthy. I do love their free shipping and free return service; What's more they provide tracking # so that I can always follow my package along w their journey.Would definitely revisit."
"April 24, 2016",4,It's decent,"I've bought from quiet a long time and had good experience with it.The clothes were always good and in good quality and customer service did help me many times. They deliver overseas which is great but it takes quiet a while. However, my sister did have many problems and was banned from using the website and is very furious about it. They suddenly blocked her with no legitimate reasoning even-though she was a regular shopper."
"April 23, 2016",4,"Glad I ordered, but will not be again.","I was honestly so nervous about ordering from Asos after reading all of their negative reviews, but I'm so glad I did! I ordered a pair of black Arizona Birkenstocks and they arrived within 3 days (which is super fast since I live in the US). The entire time I was so paranoid that I checked the tracking status every 10 minutes, but I had nothing to worry about as they arrived long before the estimated delivery date and in perfect condition. The item was just as described and the right size, so happy; however, I will no be ordering from Asos again as I am unwilling to take another chance with this company. I'm afraid that any other future orders could be a disaster!Also, the first time I placed my order I got an email saying my card was declined! Instead of using the same one, I switched cards - just a helpful tip for those of you complaining that Asos won't accept a certain card. I hope everyone else's orders work out, best of luck!"
"April 23, 2016",2,"Not the best service, unhappy customer","I got a shirt for my boyfriend in a large and after one wash it became small, also the pocket as shown on the picture came on the other side and way off. I wouldn't buy anything from here again. I also had a problem with my tracking number, customer service wasn't great."
"April 22, 2016",1,"I had he ASOS premier, but I will never buy from here again.","I've been shopping here for a couple of years. You don't know what the real customer service is until you are really in trouble.So I got this tracking email and never actually found out the tracking number and any updates.I contacted the customer service twice asking for the tracking number. Is it so hard to find out? Because they refused to tell me and they kept telling me they will look into the case if I can't get the order on the expected delivery date.So that day came. In the morning I received the email saying my order has been returned and the refund has been issued.I was like "" WHAT THE F**K""..----There was a promotion when I placed the order. And I used the promo code to save AU$50 for order over AU$$200.  After the order is returned bizarrely, you know, I never receive it.I contacted the customer service, they issued me a code, the same code.But the problem is one item in my order has been out of stock. So if I re-place the order, the order will be under AU$200. So the code is useless.I wouldn't want to buy other stuff to make the order above AU$200. Why should I?  I ask them to give me a promo code for my new order under AU$200 or extend the expiry date of the code because I want to see if others will return this out-of-stock item. They just couldn't negotiate.  I mean what the hell is wrong with them? It is their mistake. I should have got my order with all items. But instead of this, their mistake made my order go back to them and one item is even out of stock. To be honest, right now I don't know who to complain. I think the whole company is a piece of crap.Those customer service staff has supervisors. Their service is guided by their upper level. Whatever, Here it is, my experience. I have 30 or 40 happy orders, but only 1 bad order is enough.Cross your fingers and pray that your order will be good.Cross your fingers."
"April 22, 2016",4,Good,"Received my order quickly, don't understand the bad reviews. I ordered at 5pm and the parcel arrived 9am the next morning!"
"April 22, 2016",1,They say they care but when things go wrong there is no communication,"I bought a £135 purse for my wife on 9/4/16 for her birthday on the 6/5/16. Up to the 20/4/16 I didn't get the product delivered.  Apart from the confirmation email I got the same day I didn't receive any emails. So on the 20/4/16 I email Asos asking where my purchase was. I got this email:  ""Hi Adam, Thank you for getting in touch with us about your order xxxxxxxx - I'm really sorry to hear that your parcel hasn't reached you. I've looked into this and can see that there was an issue whilst your parcel was in transit with Hermes and it has been returned back to us due to the parcel being damaged. I know this wasn't the news you hoped to hear Adam and hope that no inconveniences have been caused. Here at ASOS we really do value our much loved customers such as yourself and aim to deliver the best service each and every time, but I completely understand that on this occasion this hasn't been the case. I can see that Hermes initiated the return on 13th April, so please allow a further 2 working days for the parcel to reach back at our warehouse and for the return to be processed. As soon as it's been received by 25th April latest, we'll send you an e-mail to let you know we've got the parcel. It'll then take up to 5 working days (excluding weekends) for the money to appear back in your account, depending on your card issuer/bank. I'm sorry your order wasn't received on this rare occasion Adam - if you have any other questions please let me know; I'll be here and happy to help you. Best Wishes,xxxxxx"" So they damaged the packaging for a purse so badly it couldn't be delivered and they are refunding my money (not before they get it back from the courier) and I had no clue what was going on until I contacted Asos. What I don't get now is when the package was sent to courier damaged and they decided to send it back, why didn't Asos process the refund then? Why are they making me wait for their internal processes? I now have to wait for my refund to be processed on the 25/4/16 then wait 5 days for the bank to clear it. Asos probably do care about their customers up to the point there is an error or issue at which point they don't and they put their own processes before their customers. Also when a customer contacts them they use a cut and paste email to respond.  I will not be shopping with this company again!"
"April 21, 2016",5,Perfect,I've never had a problem. Items has always came fast and the returns are fast too. I love asos.
"April 21, 2016",1,Costumer Service SUCKS!,"I send an e-mail - I wrote a comment on Facebook AND a PM on Facebook. All I got was: You have to PM us (which I did four times)... And then ""So sorry... "" bla bla. HELP instead of telling me that I have to keep waiting for your help. I have never experienced such bad service minded people. NEVER! Gahhhh!!!!!"
"April 21, 2016",4,Best Onlineshop,A lot of variety of fashion to choose from.
"April 21, 2016",1,Worse experience.,"I gave 1 star because I had to. I bought 2 jackets, they sent me a 10% of my first purchase and I used that. 1 of the jackets was listed at $39 on sale, and when I checked out the jacket was $79. I took a snapshot of the jacket displaying the price, they told me they would reimburseme when I received the order.I didn't received my order for over a month because. And my jacket I order for $39 wasn't included because now it was out of stock.However the jacket I did receive was not the best quality and wasn't worth it.I have snapshots and FB messages of all the process I went though in order to receive this order.  I have never given a bad review to anyone, but you should all be aware. This company has to much work to do to get to a level of the prices they are charging for the quality of clothes and for all the nonsense they put me through. I could send this jacket back as I just received it yesterday and ordered on March 3rd 2016.This is my first time and last time."
"April 20, 2016",1,"This is such a terrible, untrustworthy company.","I don't care what any good review says. Your chances of getting a ""good"" experience with this website is about 15%. I've read so many reviews on this website on whether or not to buy two shirts. I went with my gut and hoped that I would get my shirts on time. I ordered two pairs of shirts about 2 weeks ago and it was supposed to come April 11th, as said on the email they sent me to confirm my order. But it still hasn't come and I am BEYOND furious. Don't trust this stupid website. I am never going to buy from here again. Believe me guys, even if you see really nice clothing, don't buy it - even if it is cheap. You'll just get ripped off and you won't even get the items you want. Never am I touching this website again."
"April 20, 2016",5,Amazing service!,"I had been cautious about this website after i read the reviews but after a couple of weeks of debating whether to get something , i bought two tops. Overall i have to say the service was fantastic! The website let me see where my order was and when it would get here (in the uk) and it arrived in 4 days and was delivered on a sunday!! I will definitely be using it again because the clothes are amazing quality and the delivery service is fast."
"April 19, 2016",1,Packing,"I received an ASOS order today, which came before when it said it was going to arrive. What the item was, was a pair of sunglasses. I received the product and was disgusted with how it arrived: in a ripped open box. I thought I could trust ASOS, but am now having second thoughts about shopping there again."
"April 19, 2016",3,disappointed,"I've been shopping at ASOS for about a year now without a single problem except for their sizes being kinda wacky sometimes, but my orders always came on time and in good shape until my last recent order, which was supposed to be here Friday 4/15, which also did not come with tracking. I contacted them over the weekend and all they told me was to wait til 4/25 for my order to come in case of ""delivery delays"". Long story short, it's only 4/19 but from the reviews and stories I've read about this same situation happening to others, I have a feeling I won't be seeing my order or a refund for a very long time or at all. I'm really disappointed in one of my favorite places to shop."
"April 19, 2016",1,bad service  lack of communication  with  career  service  poor  experience  and unacceptable  offering  me  10% of  my  next  order,On to accausion  I ordered  items for  next  day  delivery  got  the  first  one 2 days later and the second 3 days  later  and paid  for next  day delivery  both companies  that  one I ordered  and  the one that delivers  was bad service  which  is DPD  all  this took  place  in one  week  now  you  would  of thought  the first  time  got  right  the second  time  this  is certainly  badly  run company  not  experience  to  take  orders  and card  payments  from  customers  and trusted  I had a supervisor  call  me  back  to  offer  me  a 10% discount  which cost  me in phone  calls  more then  two items  worse  company  on the Internet  to order  good  from just  look at their  reviews  that says it all
"April 19, 2016",1,Clothes are ok but the support is terrible! Not sure if clothes fit? Dont order!,"I have been shopping at ASOS for a couple of years. I have been happy with the products, the prices and the quality. Fortunately i have not been in contact with their support, until now.  I will try to keep the story short. A couple of weeks ago I decided that I needed new shoes and some other clothes for spring and so i went to ASOS.com. While browsing the site i noticed that they had a promo code which gave me the following: * 150 SEK off a purchase of 1000SEK-1499SEK* 250 SEK off a purchase of 1500SEK - 1999SEK* and so on.  I went ahead and placed an order of about 1750 SEK which gave me the right to use the promo code which gave me 250 SEK discount. Five days later i went to fetch the order and the postal office, I tried the clothes on and noticed that the belt and the trousers didn't fit as well i thought it would. As ASOS has free returns I simple went ahead and returned the items which didn't fit. The returned items were worth 100 + 250 SEK. About a week later I recieved an email stating that I would get 100 SEK back of total 350 SEK. This means that my promo code was gone and I had to pay 250 SEK extra. I e-mailed back asking why i didn't get the whole 350 SEK back and got the answer that by returning these items the total value of the order was no longer more than 1500 SEK which meant that the promo code stopped working. I actually think this is right but as you see above, there is a code for orders with sums between 1000 SEK and 1500 SEK. So i asked why that promo code wasn't applied instead. The answer from the support was that it doesn't work like that because the promo code is no longer usable.  About now i started to get frustrated.  1. ASOS wasn't willing to apply the smaller discount because of no reason at all.2. If I only had returned the belt for 100SEK i wouldn't had gone under 1500SEK, thus keeping my original discount.3. By returning the belt AND the trousers, thus loosing the discount, I actually GAVE the trousers back to ASOS and the same time paid for them.  I went ahead and informed the ""support"" about this and i didn't get any answer at all. So I tried asking to get the trousers back, becasue they were in my opinion still mine because I actually paid for them by returning them, as stupid as it may sound. The answer was that they couldn't send them back as the refund was already processed. They actually processed the return before the matter at hand was solved.  You wanna know what I got as an ""Im sorry"" from ASOS? I got the same discount code again and it's viable until 24/4 2016. Which is 5 days from now. Do you think I will use it? ASOS support is a joke. Before this experience I would recommend ASOS to anyone. Now I wont recommend it anymore to anyone. I wonder if ASOS now how much they loose from scr*wing with the customers over petty sums. Just help the customer and you get good PR, thus more customers.  (Will post this to all known review-sites to let customers how ASOS treats their customers)"
"April 18, 2016",5,Simply the best,"Always hassle free shopping, loads of choice with free delivery, my items came before there due date."
"April 18, 2016",4,"Good service, fast delivery","Good service, fast delivery."
"April 18, 2016",4,Great shopping experience!,"Love ASOS for a quick and easy shopping experience.Great brands, value and rewards.Only downside for me is the delivery company they use (DPD) who seriously let them down"
"April 18, 2016",1,DISGUSTING AND POOR SERVICE - UNTRUSTWORTHY COMPANY BE AWARE!,"I am absolutely disgusted by ASOS  I dont know if they have been taken over by another manager or what but their services have gone down hill and after seeing all the reviews on here I can see I am not alone on this matter. I have been an ASOS customer forever it seems and a premier account holder  I travel a lot so tend to online shop on a regular basis and more frequently so this past 6-8 months.  on several occasions they have sent me incorrect items. these problems CONSISTENTLY happened in the space of 2 months back to back and ASOS refused to take responsibility for their mistakes Not only that but the quality control process is a disgrace on several occasions I have had dresses and Nike bras & other tops arrive inside out with deodorant marks and dead skin attached. I took pictures of all of this as from past problems I have noticed that they do not accept responsibility for any of their mistakes and like to make me feel like i am lying. In addition to this I have had to make several complaints re refund where they will either refund me incorrectly, or not even refund me at all-  despite the proper paper work included in the returns they consistently got it wrong. I have just sent a returns via collect plus sent them all the proofs and received an email stating as I am having this problem again they are banning me from making purchases and not refunding me. As a whole this company is a disgrace. They have messed with the wrong customer as I am now going to take it even further and contact the ombudsmen and I think everyone else who is having this problem should do too. I will also be making charge backs via my bank. This is borderline thievery and I will not allow this to go lightly.   So beware of this company and be sure to take pictures of everything as they REFUSE to take any responsibility. Make sure you send by collect plus method ONLY as HERMES do not give you receipt on collection which could elongate the process should you be having the same problems. where possible avoid this company - I order on Zalando who are based in Germany has better quality garments and millions of brands and exceptional service and Items arrive within few days. Prompt refunds and 100 day returns."
"April 17, 2016",1,Very poor 'service',"I ordered a pair of men's jeans and a women's coat turned up! I haven't been able to get a response from ASOS over the last 48 hours- all I wanted them to do was quickly send the correct item to me to make up for their mistake, but my first email was replied to 24 hours later and then only with a question which I'd already answered and I am still waiting 24 hours later for a response to email number two. No phone numbers to call and chat always busy. I've ordered the item from Amazon instead and will send the wrong item ASOS sent me back to them for a refund, so they've lost the sale through their lack of urgency and customer focus."
"April 17, 2016",1,Still waiting...,"Ordered a top for my daughters prom, haven't received it yet and the incredibly annoying part is trying to get in touch w anyone, it's impossible. You can only email and I did that and have yet to receive a reply... I will definitely never order from them again"
"April 17, 2016",5,Great overall experience,"I am getting married later this year and knew exactly what style suit/tux I wanted. I found the exact style and color on the site but the product was out of stock for a couple weeks. I emailed back and forth with customer service, who replied the same or next day each time. I finally was able to order my suit and it only took 2 weeks to get to America. The quality is top notch and I'm super happy.  The only thing I can recommend is to get pants slightly longer than normal, unless you want that, ankle exposed high water look.."
"April 16, 2016",1,Very bad experience,"I am very unhappy with Asos. Website and clothes are great , although I can 't say for sure because the items did not reach me yet. Nobody knows what happened to my order. The customer service is nice but not very helpful and they reply according to script, like robots. They were not able to tell me until now what happened with my order. I ordered dresses for wedding ( as a guest) and it looks like I may not receive them on time especially that I fly abroad for this wedding in 2 days. Customer service takes ages to reply to my messages. I don't recommend Asos. There is something wrong in their Organisation."
"April 15, 2016",1,HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,I have to say that I was very loyal to ASOS. When I did my taxes I had spent thousands of dollars with them. I sent them hundreds of new customers. I had trust. This time was different. I ordered products from ASOS and spent a decent amount over $500.  UPS lost the package  (which took 3 days to determine) and so began the run around from ASOS! They are fully aware that the package is lost. They communicate slowly and without emotion. They refuse to refund me and keep telling me to be patient. Easy because they already have my money. So now I am obligated to be patient. This is the worst customer service and lack of value for their brand. I have been in contact communication via twitter I won't stop until I have my refund and they make this right. I will then start direct messaging all the bloggers and fashion tweeters I am in contact with so they know exactly what they are supporting. What a HORRIBLE company. In 2016 I am just completely in shock that they lack the #1 ticket to success...value of the customer.
"April 14, 2016",1,Very Poor Customer Service,"Trying to get hold of someone is very painful, the chat is never working, due to it being busy,so it says on the website,  there is no phone numbers either, asking a question is painful too as sometimes your option isn't listed.  Been trying for the last 4 hours to get through to someone about a recent order."
"April 14, 2016",1,"Stained clothes, wrong items, used products","Since end 2015 beginning 2016 Asos began sending me white clothes with huge yellow stains, shoes with crumpled straps (apparently used before), wrong items (they just chuck some random item instead of the one I ordered), and I've also experienced missing order and they asked me to wait a month and then another one more week before they grudgingly gave my refund.They REFUSED to replace the stained clothes, refused to give me the correct items. Instead they asked me to mail back the faulty stained wrong goods and said they will only Refund me when they get their dirty stuff back??!?They also were very patronizing and said ""I'm so sorry you didn't like the dress you received"".Are they nuts? Who would like a dress with a huge yellow dodgey stain on it? Or shoes that'd been worn before? Or a completely wrong item??"
"April 13, 2016",5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,Love ASOS have bought only dresses but perfection every time and returns are easy if it doesn't fit!! Couldnt ask for better service.
"April 13, 2016",1,Asos scrimping on service,"Asos are clearly being very stingy when it comes to customer service and shipping the task offshore and having it all done via email and Twitter.The responses received to queries are absolutely appalling. It's clear to see the 'advisor' is sticking to a script and not using their common sense to help out.I made an order which they said the courier 'lost' and they didn't refund me for about 3 weeks and were so unhelpful. The items were for 2 weddings I had that week and ended up without the items. They even had the cheek to send me to links to similar items 3 times the price to order instead."
"April 13, 2016",4,Great Service,I have never had any problems with ordering from ASOS and their website is best in class.
"April 13, 2016",1,Worst customer service ever,"They made a mistake in my oder and sent me the wrong item... Now I have to send it back, waste my time at the post office or alternatively they could send me someone to pick it up... but I HAVE TO PAY 8 euros for that. First and last time I order on this website."
"April 12, 2016",1,Poor service. Still waiting,"Order 3 weeks overdue and still waiting despite Web link saying no delivery delays. Customer service don't seem to be able to resolve."
"April 12, 2016",5,The Best Thing....,"I have been shopping at ASOS for a year and a half now. I love the selection of clothes. They have cheap stuff, and very expensive stuff so it's for everybody. I order from them between 1-2 a month. I always end up having to return something (I don't mind). The process is easy, normally takes less than a week. I have premier on my account, so items come within two days !! Overall, i really like it and would recommend it"
"April 12, 2016",5,"Affordable, good products and great delivery","I love ordering clothes and accessories from asos! They always deliver on time and have a great range of products, with both high-end products and cheaper options. There's a little bit for everyone :-)"
"April 11, 2016",5,Can always trust this store,"I was pleasantly surprised by Asos service with each order. The website search is very convenient, prices are alright, shipping is in time always. I've got a load of clothes and accessories there, will buy more."
"April 10, 2016",5,Love shopping on Asos!,I shop regularly on Asos. They have such a nice selection of clothing/jewelry/beauty/shoes to a reasonably price. I love that you can save items for 60 days and it says when an item is soon out of stock. I order from Asos a lot and have never had a problem with shipping. Plus if you are a student you can get 10 % your purchase from Asos with Unidays.
"April 09, 2016",1,can NOT be trusted! WON' T shop at ASOS again!,"I've been shopping at asos.com for more than 6 years, I liked it very much,  but it's not the same asos anymore. They keep sending me wrong items.  the worst thing is their ‘’customer service‘’, had to wait for 2 days to get their answer by email which was not helpful.  Returning  was not an easy thing!! 28 working days after I returned the wrong items ,I still hadn't received any email telling they had received the package, neither got my refund. I contacted with them, then they asked me to show some proof.but the postage receipt didn't show the postage cost, then I had to show them with my creditcard records to prove how much I paid. This time they sent a wrong top again, I havn't got any email from their customer service yet! Won't shop at Asos again!!"
"April 09, 2016",1,Complete joke as a company!,"I ordered a 2 dresses which looked fab one of them turns out to be really crap so i decide to return it on returning this dress with booking a collection from hermes off asos website, week went by and no contact that it's been received or anything about my refund i decided contact them myself they started by asking for tracking number which i then provided lol the cheek they then started to ask for more proof so i forward them the email from hermes that i booked for a return they collected on what date but noo that wasn't enough now i was asked to show more proof (like that wasn't enough) what else am i meant to show apparently hermes should have gave me a receipt which they didn't and now I won't receive my money or the dress back lol it's complete joke! Buying something they're quick to send refund something it's not as easy.Not to be trusted! Got ripped off"
"April 09, 2016",1,Horrible customer service,There is not customer service at all.
"April 08, 2016",2,I never get my order,I live in the USA and whenever I order anything from ASOS it either takes a month or I never recieve it. I always contact customer support and they are always pretty nice and understanding I just don't understand how my orders never get to me! Which sucks because their clothes are so cute!
"April 08, 2016",5,Good quality & price,"I recommend ASOS for good quality & price but the delivery is poor. Delivery within a country does not depend on them, depends on the turnpike man and sometimes it can be really annoying.Four stars for good quality & price, great designer clothes and polite personnel ;)"
"April 08, 2016",1,Worst customer service I have experienced,"I would like everybody to be aware of the terrible customer service of ASOS. For myself personally, I have made the decision to never ever place an order at this website again. The reason for this is the fact that I have experienced the most misleading customer service ever. I will explain you guys what happened: I saw a pop-up ad on Facebook for a blue shirt and I liked it so I decides to order one but I accidently forgot to select the size and therefore in my order the size S was automatically selected. I know from previous orders that ASOS always tell that with the Standard delivery method, it's possible to cancel your order within one hour. Reasonable deal, that's what I thought in the first place. But then I actually wanted to cancel my order. I went to my placed orders but there was not a ""Cancel"" button at all. I am 100% sure that my order was placed under the Standard delivery method. When I tried to contact the customer service, I firstly had to wait at least 10 minutes before the ""Live Chat"" became available. When I finally got to speak to an employee of ASOS she first wanted to know all details of my orders (order nr., name, birth date et cetera). She responded very very slow and wouldn't believe my complaint that there was no ""Cancel"" button. It truly costed me more than one and a half hour to communicate with this woman and the result of the conversation was only a transcript of the terrible chat in my mail box... In the end I sent the order back after it arrived at my house and I will get my refund but my problem is the way they are handling problems of customers. It literally takes 150 times as long to cancel an order compared to the time and easiness of placing an order. I actually get sick from it... Thanks, Martijn Strijp"
"April 08, 2016",5,"Easy to us website, great quality clothes!","I am a little taken aback at the reviews on this site for ASOS as I have found them only to be brilliant! I've been shopping with them for over 5 years now, and have found the returns process easy, clothes arrive on time and are of decent quality.I've had instances where I need to contact their team to sort out an order, and they've always bent over backwards to assist. I find them to be trustworthy and would recommend them."
"April 08, 2016",1,Delivered to wrong address / Stolen,Delivered my £100+ order to neighbour which was subsequently lost/stolen. Informed me that it was a civil matter and not their problem because in their eyes the order had been delivered. They have taken my money and literally given me absolutely nothing in return. An absolute disgrace of a company.
"April 08, 2016",1,Shocking customer service - I wish I could give 0 stars,"I can not believe how terrible this companies customer service is. I tried to order twice through ASOS. My orders were rejected both times although my card details were authorised and the money was suspended in my account as 'authorisations pledged'. I contacted my bank, who told me that my card details were obviously fine and everything was fine on their end. I then contacted ASOS and received the most frustrating, dismissive emails in response. The first email I received (from a Jodie) told me to 'check my card details are correct, detail your cookies and try again'. I was also told that they could not authorise NAB (their bank) to release the funds back to me, and that I would have to call their bank myself and ask them to release the funds and that their was nothing else they could do. Right... because I'm sure that NAB would have released my funds, and not just laughed at me.I replied that this was not good enough, and that I was sure my card details were correct as I had the money pledged from my account (which they already knew). I also told them that I would not be deleting my cookies and re-ordering, as they couldn't tell me why my orders were rejected, and apparently it was then my problem to chase up my money from their stuff up.ASOS responded again, calling me Jodie (not my name, but the name of the first customer service rep) and telling me again that there was nothing they could do and the problem was 100% with my bank.I wanted to give ASOS my money, and they didn't want to help me work out what the issue with the order was, or help me get my money back. Telling a customer that it's their problem to chase up, when it's clearly an issue on your end is a sure way to tick people off. And if that didn't do the trick, then sending them an email with the wrong person's name in it is definitely the icing on the cake.ASOS, lift your game. I will never order from your site again, and I hope I was a one off with this dreadful service, or you will lose plenty more customers."
"April 07, 2016",1,Entire Order Out Of Stock!!,"Made an order - was emailed 4 days letter to be told they could not supply one item out of the entire order - complete waste of my time!! Tried to contact customer care to reply - impossible - generic emails only!! Very Bad Experience - ASOS please sort this out as your clothes are great!"
"April 07, 2016",5,Fast delivery and nice fitting clothes of their Plus Size collection.,Made an order from their Plus Size range and were really happy with the quality and fit of the clothes. As for slightly bigger girl there's always a problem to find nice and good fitting clothes. But ASOS does a great job! I even got a cereal bar with my order which was a really nice surprice. Thank you!
"April 06, 2016",5,Ignore the bad reviews!,"I can't understand the bad reviews! Asos is great and full of wonderful products. I especially adore their selection of faux fur coats, which are the best selection from any website i've seen, many different designs you won't find anywhere else. Oh and delivery is super quick. Love it!"
"April 05, 2016",1,not to be trusted,"3 years i was buying from this site it was the first click when i wanted new clothes. since this month :( they changed their courier for international delivery and now we have to pay customs before we can get the goods -.- they don't even admit that they changed so they don't have to pay taxes -.-just so rude. and i'm very disappointed and i guess i will not buy from them anymore what a shame :("
"April 05, 2016",4,ONE OF MY FAVOURITES,"Delivery is always quick,material is excellent and wash up well.Free returns and card credited as soon as they receive it,normally within a week.Definately one of my favourite fashion websites.Sorry ASOS just edited this review to 4* as you no longer give cashback on Quidco unless you are a new customer!!!!!!"
"April 05, 2016",4,Over 5 years of shopping at ASOS.com,"I have been shopping at ASOS.com for over 5 years now and have only had one bad experience. The items I have received are always true to size and great quality. The prices have gone up lately but they always have good sales. I prefer ASOS over other sites because their styles are on trend and they are constantly receiving new items so there is always a lot to choose from. They also have variety. I have shopped there for my single, vegas-vacation days and now for my bridal shower...I did recently get a dress that I was totally disappointed by - the material was foamy and the hem was unfinished and uneven - just bad! Thankfully they are GREAT with returns.  Overall, I love ASOS.com and hope others can enjoy them too."
"April 05, 2016",4,Trustworthy,I've shopped on ASOS for at least 8 years now and must say I have barely ever had any issues what so ever. They are extremely trust worthy. They are fast at delivering and refunding items and good at responding to queries. On the rare occasion where I have not received one item in my order they apologise for their mistakes and happily replace/refund the missing item without any problems. Their customer service is great. I confidently shop on here all the time!
"April 05, 2016",2,Normally good... Until it goes wrong,"Have been buying from Asos for years with no problems. I pay to have a Premier account so that I can get free next day delivery. I have never had any problems so have never had to deal with their customer service department... Until now! Every time they use DPD delivery is fine. When they use Hermes it is a nightmare. Hermes tracking information only told me the order had been generated and it did not arrive. 6 days after ordering I have still not had the item and customer service just keep replying with generic answers that don't answer my questions! The most frustrating customer service department I have ever spoken to. Asos please stop using Hermes and please tell customer service to stop being robots using generic responses and actually reply to questions!!!!!!"
"April 05, 2016",1,never ever order from ASOS,"The worst online company for clothes, returns and refunds."
"April 02, 2016",2,Poor customer service,"ASOS has some cute clothing items but the customer service is not worth it. Their customer service mainly communicates via social media- i.e. Facebook, Twitter. If you do not have a social media account, you are basically screwed.  I've tried emailing them multiple times in reference to a package I never received (and which I never received a tracking number for), and they only gave a generic, unhelpful response. You're better off going to boohoo.com which has cute clothing and amazing customer service."
"April 02, 2016",1,Terrible service,"It's amazing how bad the customer service is. They answer very fast but it's always a standard answer where they fail to really focus on solving the problem. Fail to listen the problem and actively find a slolution that satisfies the client. International shipping is terrible, avoid using it specially if timing is very tight."
"April 01, 2016",1,Froever fobbing me off!,"I sent an item back over 2 weeks ago, ASOS are stating they haven't received it yet, which I don't question. I used Hermes returns, so they may have lost it. I have been asked 3 times to show proof of postage. I have done each time. And then I keep getting told to ""email back in a few days"" ""it can take 8 working days to receive and process a refund"" IT'S BEEN 8 DAYS! Stop trying to fob me off! I will be putting in a complaint with trading standards next week. It's not on. By using a free returns service provided by ASOS, I trusted it would be safe and I would have had my refund by now but ASOS are not being helpful at all!"
"March 30, 2016",1,Don't use,"So bad company Ordered sunglasses x6 and they came with clear plastic bag instead of proper cover They offered cheap Asos cover instead but I refused to accept that offer as main distributor selling them with original cover Shocking"
"March 29, 2016",1,"Items not delivered - ""They are quick enough to take your money but after that they couldnt care less""","They are quick enough to take your money but after that they couldnt care less. I purchased an item and after it being said that it would be delivered in a certain time period it was not. After waiting ten days since i placed the order i contacted asos directly only to be told that there was a ""problem with the courier service"" and i would have to wait a furter four days for the item. I certaintly did not expect to wait two weeks and would of prefered if they informed me to tell me about the glitch instead i was mistreated. Considering i am a loyal customer and regularly purchase from asos i would of thought i would of been treated better especially when you pay a decent amount of money for the items. Im sorry to say but you have lost a valuable customer and i will not be shopping with you again."
"March 29, 2016",1,Bad experience Ordering from US,"I have been ordering from ASOS for years and never had a bad experience until for some reason, their courier and USPS didn't connect or for some reason, I didn't receive my package. I got in touch with customer service and over 2 weeks went by with their customer service telling me to get in touch with USPS, which I did each time they recommended it. BUT it seems like they have no other solution! I even asked - what happens when I don't receive this package? What's the next solution? I followed their advice each time, and still didn't get my goods. And they didn't seem to care that I (a) was out almost $100 (b) wasn't having a good experience with their brand (c) didn't receive my order, probably will never receive it or my money back.  I'm SO disappointed that I put them on blast on Twitter, and they were responsive for awhile, but now they probably think I'm a nut-job. BUT their service has been so atrocious that I felt I had no choice.  Another thing that bugged me about the customer service experience was that I tried the chat option once and the CS rep just ended the conversation without the usual ""is there anything else I can help with"" but rather said something like, ""this is what we have to offer and please email us with any further inquiry"".  I get the sense that ASOS has changed their customer care policy (and maybe even US courier)? To save money / be more profitable. They're clearly doing the most they can to keep people from reuniting with their money AND this courier SUCKS. I used to work at a corporate retailer (who's no longer in business) who used to do similar cost cutting methods. Good grief!!!"
"March 29, 2016",5,great!,I don't know if I was lucky but till now very good experience in this store. I have returned items too from Ireland and everything went so easy and nicely.
"March 28, 2016",1,Didn't received any refund,I have sent back more than a month ago 2 pairs of trousers. Still didn't received back any money. 35 pounds just like that.I contacted customer care and ask for a receipt from Royal Mail proving that I've sent it back. Obviously I don't have it anymore. Won't order from them anymore.
"March 28, 2016",1,Unfortunate Experinece,"I highly do not recommend ordering from asos. First and for most they do not have a call line for assistance which should have been a red flag, but I ordered anyways. My shipment contained a couple hundred dollars worth and the package was never received. I am from the U.S. so it is possible that they do not have proper contracts for missing packaged with post offices in the U.S. Their website for customer service was not easy to navigate, nor was it useful. I received a response from Georgina that  stated ""we have no further need to look into this for you"". Outch! I was questionable about ordering from this website and I regret not going with my gut and shopping somewhere else.  I am writing this so that others don't have the same dilemma I did. I feel robbed!"
"March 26, 2016",5,Beautiful dress,"I purchased the crepe pencil dress with know detail in colour blush for £45. I never ever spend that much money but honestly the dress was beautiful. Their sizes are quite generous but this was a perfect fit. Free delivery, free returns, fast replys if you need any help. Overall an amazing site I use all the time :) WARNINGprettylittlething.com is a scamming website. I'm making people aware. Take a look at their reveiws. most off their reveiws are 1 start and over half their 5 star reveiws the company has written themselves. If you don't believe me look for yourself."
"March 25, 2016",1,Absolutely failed!,"I put my order at the 10th of February...today is  25th of March and I still didn'r receive that. Delivary time was untill 24th of February.Absolutely inappropriate,plus,after 1 month they refunded one of my item without telling me anything about it cause it was out of stock!"
"March 24, 2016",5,The place I go when I get paid,"Everytime I order from Asos (which is a lot) it is an easy experience on the computer and even the app, especially if you have Apple Pay. It is a welcoming website with clothing from every shape and size and are very helpful with any questions, and if you order a lot (like me) from Asos, they put you on an a list and give you free deliveries on some orders and special offers. Best website in the world and I couldn't live without it!! Thank you Asos"
"March 22, 2016",1,BAD expericence,"My order didn't arrive at the time stated, so I emailed them. The next I received on email which read 'I hope our response to our query was helpful' which was the only email received and then asked for me to fill in a survey about their customer service.I was not told that my item would be delayed for another week and ASOS let me down with lack of communication"
"March 22, 2016",4,"Nice clothes, great prices","Greetings from Russia! Thank you for delivering here, I love the clothes and they are cheap which is very good for me. Will keep buying from Asos for a long time."
"March 22, 2016",5,A modern-day ecommerce experience,"Good website and overall experience, with a great selection of delivery options and a free returns system."
"March 22, 2016",5,I love Asos,"They provide fast shipping and have super cute stylish clothes.  There was only one time that they took a while to ship, and that was 2 years ago around Christmas time. So it's understandable. Other then that, they ship pretty fast. I live in California and receive my items in 3 days top. Customer service is great and always answers your questions fast. Returning is also easy."
"March 21, 2016",5,Never had any issues!,"I've ordered (and returned) ASOS items many times over the past couple of years, and I have never had a problem with either the quality of their items, or the quality of the customer service. Returns have always been processed quickly, have nothing bad to say about them. Would definitely recommend.  They seem to have a lot of bad reviews on here, which I don't understand, but I suppose that with a big company there will always be people who are unhappy!"
"March 20, 2016",5,Love asos!,Been ordering from ASOS for years!! They have always delivered on time and lovely garments. Only online shop I never stop ordering from. Great pics and no fuss refunds.
"March 19, 2016",1,Received worn items! Bad customer service.,I ordered a coat from Asos for my birthday just over a month ago. The item never arrived despite showing as delivered on the couriers website. After numerous emails they eventually sent out a replacement coat which I received to then find that it had already been worn and also items in the pockets! The tags were also removed from the coat and the returns label wasn't included which meant I couldn't return the coat or get a refund. Utterly disappointed and I won't be ordering from them again.
"March 18, 2016",3,Always so quick and good service but..,"I have ordered from them a few times, clothes and shoes once. Shoes were nice and comfy, fit me perfectly. But there is an isuue with clothes.I ordered them a few times and it never looked like on the pictures or even catwalk (is the video retouched too?). Fabrics looks always different than in the picture. I ordered a few times and had to send back all clothes! It doesn't happen to me so often with other websites. I order from New Look and different brands and it is great most of the time.I do not know, if their clothes are so retouched but I was never happy with what I saw :-(. I wish I bought a single clothes from them as I think, they ship quickly and their service is good in general. I need to give up with shopping there..."
"March 17, 2016",5,never had a problem,"always 5* and always receive a swift reply to any faults. highly recommended"
"March 17, 2016",2,"Good selection, Dreadful Service","Asos is good for some things. There is an excellent selection of own brand and branded clothing. Some items are of very low quality however despite a premium price, I've lost buttons on day one, had seams that aren't fit for purpose and just had items that come and the material is clearly budget, even when paying a lot. They have a reasonable returns policy, there is nothing to pay, everything can go back in it's original packaging for a full refund. Unfortunately, this is where the good experience stops. Delivery is hit and miss, I live in London so we're used to decent delivery experience and for me it's an incredibly important part of the sales process. Home Deliveries are usually ok, you get a 1 hour delivery window which is very useful. However, delivery to stores is abysmal. I've used the service a few times and it's yet to work out for me. I appreciate that ASOS have no control over the stores but they should absolutely check them out before using them. If something goes wrong with an order, that's where the problems really start. Customer service speak like 12 year olds in class. Or at least that's how they are trying to come across.  If you're looking for a cheap pair of jeans and don't mind too much when they arrive, the store can be of use. However you really could end up on the end of one of the most frustrating customer service experiences possible. So ask yourself, is it worth it?"
"March 16, 2016",5,Very good website!,"Honestly, I don't understand why people are so disappointed in this website, I personally, love it.Good sale on brands, good quality, fast delivery even on weekends, and I am very pleased with the refund policy and next day delivery, even weekends - very helpful when you forget a friend's birthday :)  Every time I refunded some items, which unfortunately where either too small, or just didn't like how it fits, I had my money back with no problems.Thanks Asos!!!"
"March 16, 2016",1,Absolutely absorb! Worst ever,"Order something from this place it never arrived, I email their ""costumer service"" department which is non-existent and they would not help me they just kept telling me my info was wrong. Finally they said that it would arrive in 7 months Really!!!!! are you serious they would not give me my money back, absolutely the worst company ever!"
"March 15, 2016",1,Terrible experience,My order did not arrive.I have paid for it. After 9 days they told me to wait another 9 days to be sure it will not arrive. After that they told me to wait several days they will solve it. After that they told me they will send it to me within 9 days. I asked them if they could send it to me within 3 days (that I can pay for it!) and they said no. Alright. It is month and half. Nothing arrived. NEVER AGAIN.
"March 15, 2016",5,All ways a great experience,"I've placed several orders over the course of many years never been disappointed ... if I didn't like something, I return it with ease (free returns)Student discount always helps I've gotten it delivered within the UK and also in Dubai and Sri Lanka, always very quick ...of course it takes a bit longer outside the UK  such a great variety and choice Its my go to for online shopping - A loyal customer :)"
"March 14, 2016",5,Amazing customer service,"I've used asos quite a lot for my daughter, clothes are lovely quality, delivery and exchange brilliant, but most of all I wanted to leave a review for their customer service which is absolutely excellent. I bought a dress for my daughter as a surprise and by the time she received it and decided she wasn't sure and it was far too long for her, it was out of the 28 day return. Asos were so helpful, let me return the dress free of charge and gave me a speedy refund. Professional company, with excellent customer service would highly recommend, and will continue to use."
"March 12, 2016",1,HORRIBE. If I could give a 0 i would.,"I love the clothes that the brand delivers, BUT, they serve horrible shipping services, horrible customer service with no telephone service, and sometimes lacking quality in their clothing. I am terrified each time I order from here from fear of needing to start a case for missing items, or dealing with OVERPRICED customs from UPS. UPS is the MOTHER of HORRIBLE customer service. Together they are MONEY HUNGRY THIEVES. I wonder who ships out the items, probably someone who does not have much sympathy for others time and hard earned money."
"March 11, 2016",1,LIARS!,"Ordered boots for my girlfriend ,which should have been delivered within 4days -> waited 2 weeks and within those two weeks contacted asos customer service 5 times and all the time i received answer i have to wait because there is problems with delivery/ delay regards to delivery company, i waited until their mentioned date and i wrote them again where i got to investigation about my missing parcel, received an email next day-Refund! your boots werent in stock when you ordered them ,we hoped to get them in stock  and then send them ! I wasnt even asked or informed about it!! why did they have to lie since first moment, if you dont have them then tell me from the beginning and i will find elsewhere but this is just horrendous ! worst company Ive ever dealt with, ebay gives more trust than these ones! customer service not helpful and tryed to finish conversation asap even tho you havent finished to find things out.I know A LOT about customer service but this is just a joke! DISAPPOINTED problem solution-0 honesty-0professionalism-0"
"March 11, 2016",4,"Quick service, cheap prices and great clothes",I have used asos for 5 years now. I love it!
"March 10, 2016",2,Poor Quality,"Poor quality clothing for that price! It took 3 weeks to deliver. Will never buy from again.At least the returns/refund was processed quickly enough."
"March 10, 2016",1,Send wrong sizes and misguiding customer service,"won't refund me. When they agreed to refund me, they refunded the wrong amount.I suggest you only buy with Paypal so you can open a dispute and try and stay away from them."
"March 10, 2016",1,asos poor quality menswear,Bought a men's coat from asos. Came with faulty zip which cannot be replaced due to poor design.Also popper came off within first wear which is also unfixable. Cannot send for a replacement due to bad weather meaning the need for a coat is urgent and cannot wait for refund and replacement item. Totally sub standard product not fit for purpose. And in no way cost effective. Need solution.
"March 10, 2016",1,Beware of discount scam!!!,"The $50 off of $200 code is a scam! All of their codes are. If you return one item they will not refund you what you paid and make sure they keep the funds on the supposed ""discount"" you received. I have been a long time customer and am completely disgusted by how GREEDY they have become. I just got refunded $2.00 on an item that was $52.00 because they subtracted the ""discount"". PAY ATTENTION to your returned items and invoices. This should not be legal and is very unethical. Asos I hope you treat your customers fairly sooner than later. Ever hear of that saying: buyer beware? Ya...."
"March 05, 2016",1,Don't like giving customers a refund,"This has to be the worst company I have ever had the misfortune to use. Ordered some goods, paid for them and they are not delivered and they will not refund my money.  Their Courier returned them to their depot without even attempting delivery and I can't get my money back.  Customer service is awful, rude and full of excuses.  Do not use!!!!"
"March 04, 2016",1,"Horrible, rude customer service.","Unless you plan on paying for the $11.99 shipping to get it tracked and guarantee a shipping date, the standard shipping is actually 7 days earlier than the actual date. I ordered something to be guaranteed by 3/3 but then they told me I actually needed to wait until 3/11 after they were horrible rude and unhelpful. Don't waste your time. Use Revolve instead."
"March 03, 2016",5,Great website,"Love this website. There is a huge selection of products. The different categories and filters make it easy to find what you want.The option to save items to your wishlist is helpful too.They keep you informed on the progress of your order. I have never had a delivery arrive late. And any refunds are always dealt with quickly."
"March 03, 2016",1,Shame on you ASOS,"I paid for the unlimited next day delivery and last Friday I ordered two items and were supposed to get them both the day after. But ASOS ""brilliantly"" gave one parcel to Hermes and one to DPD and so on Saturday I got two emails from the two couriers about the delivery. While DPD (as always) gave me the one hour window so I could make sure I wouldn't miss the delivery even if I wanted to go out before the delivery time, Hermes only told me that the parcel would be delivered on the day which means that they expected me to stay at home all day on Saturday to wait for a parcel. I had a quick supermarket trip and when I came home I saw a card left by Hermes with only the word ""Monday"" on the card. No matter on the card or on their website there was totally NO WAY I could contact them to rearrange a delivery.  So I stayed at home ALL DAY on Monday to wait for the parcel. It never arrived. A whole day wasted and hey I paid for next day delivery and the parcel should have been with me on Saturday!  Contacted ASOS saying I didn't want the parcel anymore since it was late and I didn't want to stay at home for another day to wait for a parcel which no one could guarantee whether it would arrive or not. Quickly got a reply saying they had asked Hermes to send the parcel back to ASOS warehouse and a refund would be given to me afterwards.  A few hours later I got another reply from another ASOS staff saying they had checked with Hermes and the item would be redelivered to me. I was so annoyed and replied to ask them to check again. Then I got a reply saying they misread my email and they definitely had asked Hermes to return my parcel to ASOS so to process a refund. Two days later which is today Hermes sent me an email in the morning saying they would deliver my parcel!!! What's going on? No choice but had to contact ASOS asking why and they said they called Hermes to confirm and the parcel would definitely be sent back to ASOS.  Only 10 MINUTES later I got a text from Hermes saying the parcel would be delivered today before 4pm!!!! Once again I had to ask ASOS and they said they had no control whether Hermes drivers got the instruction or not so if the parcel arrived I could SIMPLY return it. Great! Is that what customer service is? They obviously don't care customers. ASOS took my money but they NEVER helped solve the problem but instead causing more confusions and frustrations and now they just expect me to make a special trip only to return a late parcel?! I even got an email from ASOS asking me to comment on their customer service! It said ""I really hope I resolved you query""! Are you joking? PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS SHOP. It will just waste your time."
"March 03, 2016",1,Worst Experience - Just want my money back,"This website is terrible. Placed an order for a product before Christmas - waited till end of January before complaining. Was informed that they had some challenges, and should expect the product around the end of February but I'm still waiting for the product (this is March).  The annoying this is that someone in Customer Service placed another order around the end of January after my complaint without taking permission to do so (I requested for a refund then, not an opportunity to wait fruitlessly for another month) - was promised that my good would arrive end of February.  First and last time using this company!!"
"March 02, 2016",5,What's all the buzz about?,"I've been using Asos forever and I never experienced problems? I live outside the uk, and I always order clothes from asos. Works for me"
"March 02, 2016",5,Love asos,"I was shocked when I read all these bad reviews, I have been using asos for years and have never had a problem. They are 100% my go to online shop"
"February 29, 2016",1,Disgusting service.,"I ordered an item for Saturday delivery and DPD didn't bother to deliver the item. They lied about it and took a picture of the floor.  Completely ruined my weekend, and now I'm being made to walk miles to pick the item up. All asos can do is say sorry?!! How about sorry for ruining your weekend, sorry that you're paying for asos premier and now have to pick up your own parcels! If I buy from an online retailer I expect it to be delivered to my home. After telling them I won't be purchasing from them again even though I've been a customer since they first started business they were not even bothered. Why bother giving a company business if they are not bothered to keep you. Disgusting service and disgusting customer values. Do not buy from them if you live in a city centre unless you like to walk!"
"February 28, 2016",1,I will never shop with ASOS again!,"A couple of weeks ago I ordered a beautiful dress from Asos, but received a horrible top instead. They told me on the chat that they would send a replacement, but it never happened! After contacting them 4 times on the chat, where they all told me different thing and lied to me, I finally asked to speak to a manager. They told me that I would receive a call within 24 hours, which of course never happened either!! I am not gonna bother sending the item back because it is going to cost me half the price of the ""dress"" and I am pretty certain with their trackrecord now, that they wont return the cost anyway. I would not recommend anyone to shop with them online, as there are so many better and reliable sites to use.I can also see that ASOS isnt replying to any of these trustpilot messages, which is also totally unacceptable!"
"February 28, 2016",1,Worst Customer Service I Ever Experienced,"They seem great until you need customer service...my package did not arrive, apparently lost in shipping, and they repeatedly gave me the run-around, put me off (my guess is hoping I'd go away). They claimed they couldn't trace the package because it had no tracking number, then said they were ""investigating"" what happened to it. I'd like to know how they can ""investigate"" with no tracking number. Nice clothes, but trying to get a refund or replacement is not worth the hassle of ordering from them. Too many other sites that offer real customer service. I reported them to the Better Business Bureau and my credit card company was decent enough to credit me for the loss ASOS caused."
"February 26, 2016",1,Incorrect information on the website,"Parcel arrived late but also the items advertised as ""regular fit"" turned out to be ""athletic cut"". Unbelievable given that the type info is written right on the t-shirt and its labels. Total waist of my time. If you're doing late holiday shopping like I did - avoid them. My only hope is the airport shops now."
"February 25, 2016",5,Great value!,Got a fantastic deal on some tshirts which I purchased at the last moment and they were delivered next day in time for me to fly out on my holiday!
"February 25, 2016",1,INSANELY BAD SERVICE,"I just recieved an order consisting of 4 items, one where ripped into pieces and one was wrong. They refuse to refund after promisising that on the phone AND they send me one more wrong thing. The people in mails are RUDE and with the lowest intelligence I've ever seen. Please be careful and you just lost a good costumer."
"February 23, 2016",1,I would give 0 stars if I could,I received my package today that I tried to cancel but you said that I could just easily return it when it arrives. What you didn't tell me was that I would have to pay over 25 euros for this return from Finland. Especially as a student I will not pay that kind of fee for one return of two products. Now I remember again why I haven't ordered anything from you in a long time..
"February 23, 2016",1,"Items never arrived, rude customer service - had to FIGHT for a refund","Right up there with some of the worst customer service I ever experienced. In fact, I think its the worst. I ordered items on 29 Dec 2015 but they obviously got lost in the post. The latest my order was supposed to arrive was 29 Jan 2016. When I called on 1 Feb 2016 they insisted I wait until 18 February for a refund.....but... when I called on 19 February they reneged on their promise and refused to refund me.  They also lied to me about the supposed reasons for delay. I eventually managed to get a refund but only after I took to social media and inundated them with negative posts. Even then they totally ignored my post on Facebook and Twitter requests until I copied their head of media relations - @sedgebeswick An absolute disgrace - a quick Google search uncovers lots and lots of people experiencing similar issues. I'll never buy anything from them again."
"February 22, 2016",3,Good and bad,"I ordered there a few of times. The shipment was fast, the customer service ok, but I was disappointed with most of the items. The quality was so so and then I had to bother sending back the items... Put aside the fact that I actually had to pay importation taxes that were more expensive that the items I ended up buying. They did refund me for the items I sent back pretty fast. I like going around the website to see the pictures and inspiration, but I'm not buying there anymore. It's too much of a hassle."
"February 22, 2016",5,It always works,"I have ordered at ASOS several times. They dispatched the ordered items quickly and correct. The packages, I have received, were always in good form. So I don't have anything to complain so far."
"February 22, 2016",1,BAAAD SERVICE,"Customer care is really key when it comes to running a succesfull business!  What does it help to have a good brand, nice website, good prices, etc, if in the end the customer is left unsatisfied?  I purchased a coat from the website ASOS on friday. I paid DKK 100 extra for express delivery (day after delivery) because I want to receive the coat as soon as possible and before I leave for Brussels on Wednesday. I've been tracking the package on DHL's website the entire weekend (yes, I am THAT excited about  a damn coat), and the entire weekend it looked like it was in Germany still. Today when I checked it was the same story so I called DHL and they informed me that indeed the package is still in Germany and I will most likely not receive it today :O I mean, when a customer actually pays extra to receive the package faster, and it says on the order confirmation that it will be delivered on Monday, February 22, between 7 am and 10 pm - how can you still have the package not dispatched from Germany on that same day????  To top it off, I did not find any telephone number to which I could call to clarify this, so had to settle for an email adress. I mean c'mon, how can you, as an online store, not have a number to which customers can call to receive rapid feedback/answers to their queries?  Maybe I will still receive my coat today, but that is not likely to happen. If it does, it still has caused me frustration and I am not likely to come back to shopping with ASOS ever again."
"February 19, 2016",2,"One Terrible, One OK Experience","My first order from this website was a dress for my sister's wedding. It was easy to place and I received a confirmation email right away. I received a shipping confirmation a couple days later with tracking #. The next day I received a follow up e-mail letting me know the shipment might be a few days late due to poor weather on the east coast. I periodically checked the tracking # to see it's progress or get an estimated arrival date. The only information available I could see was that it had been dispatched from their warehouse. About 8 days after I initially placed the order, I received an email saying my order had been successfully returned to ASOS and my money would be refunded in 8-10 days. I contacted ASOS through their chat window (there is NO phone number to call, all communication is via chat or email, which is very frustrating) and asked how my ordered had been returned when I never received it in the first place. The rep was somewhat helpful, and after some digging said my order had never made it out of the warehouse and was accidentally returned before it shipped. So I guess the tracking # was bogus the whole time. I asked if they could cancel the return and just send the dress out, and she said no. I would have to reorder the dress and repay while waiting to get my refund back. I decided to just go ahead and reorder it because I really loved the dress. I went to purchase, and the website said my size was out of stock. I opened the chat once again, got a different rep who was absolutely zero help and kind of an jerk. I let them know what happened, and asked if they could assist me because I knew there was at least ONE dress in my size available, it had been returned to their warehouse and was the one I had already paid for once. He said there was nothing they could do, I would just have to watch the website to see if it got updated (they couldn't send me any email alert), then he said there was a size 10 available to ship. A size 10 isn't very close to a size 4, but thanks. I was eventually refunded my money, and I ended up finding a different dress from a trusted retailer. After I ordered the dress, I placed a separate order for a bathing suit a day later. I was sent a shipping confirmation that said there was no tracking # available, but it should arrive by Feb 3rd. On Feb 5th when i did not received the package, I messaged ASOS and was told I should allow for an additional week in case of shipping delays. After that week, I messaged ASOS again and they asked me to check with my neighbors and anywhere else it could've been delivered, though they could not actually verify if it had been delivered or not. I let them know NO packages had been delivered to me, and was told they would investigate and get back to me in a couple of days. The next day i received an e-mail saying the original package had been lost, but they'd send me a new order via UPS express with tracking # at no expense. I received the bathing suit yesterday as promised. Basically, I would use this company at your own risk and only for inexpensive items. Also don't order anything you need right away, because if you do get it it's probably not going to be in the original time frame they said."
"February 19, 2016",1,Very Unreliable Service,"I ordered a t shirt but was sent the wrong item. When I let them know of their mistake they again sent me the wrong item.When I contacted them again they cancelled my order and said I would have to place my order again.I asked whether I would be sent the correct order if I ordered again and they said they would look into the issue and get back to me within 48 hours. They didn't.I contacted them again with the same query and they again told me they would look into the issue and get back to me within 48 hours. Again they didn't. They just dont seem to care."
"February 18, 2016",1,Parcel still MIA,"Ordered an item from ASOS on the 2nd of February for international delivery (Europe) and received an email saying it had been dispatched on the 2nd and should expect it around the 11th but to wait until the 16th.  The postal service here are very good at leaving slips incase noone was home and will take it back out for delivery the next day then leave it in the post office for a few more days. I have contacted ASOS but now been told to wait until the 27th. Reading other reviews quite disappointed as it seems like another 'phantom parcel' that has gone MIA."
"February 18, 2016",4,Hit and miss: Mostly hit,"I use Asos quite a bit just because the range in stock is a lot wider than most of the competition. The delivery options are pretty good (especially if you have the Prime equivalent) and it is also very easy to return items that do not fit or you just don't like. My only gripe is that the product size charts are very generic and don't always match reality. I also received an item that had clearly been returned by another customer and hadn't been repackaged properly (I really shouldn't be able to tell)."
"February 18, 2016",5,Outstanding,"I've been using asos for 10 years and in that time they've gone from a small online company into a major retailer. I have asos premier which is brilliant value for £9.95 unlimited next day delivery and free returns. Never had any issues with asos, sometimes the delivery lets them down but the orders are always despatched on time. I find when using DPD my orders arrive when expected, Hermes aren't that great. Asos has a great site/app, emails are responded to in just a couple of hours, the product range is brilliant. Overall, can't really fault them"
"February 17, 2016",1,"Poor service, order never received","Never received my order, they took 2 weeks to ""investigate"" then told me it was now out of stock! Will never use them again."
"February 16, 2016",1,Collect Plus delivery issues,"To be honest, until this order, I never had any issues with ASOS, in France and UK. But this was a 490 pounds order, collect plus delivery....parcel lost in the wild! I went 3 times in the store with my 1st ready for collection and my 2 collection reminder messages... wasted journeys, no parcel. ASOS could not help, Collect Plus contacted could not help. Finally the parcel appeared to be on its way back to the sender. But 10 days after, still nothing, as the parcel is obviously lost since the beginning. ASOS plays it foolish with me from the first complain: they are always really very sorry in each email (at a point, I don't really care that Kenny, David, Sandra, Ciara, Tom, and half ASOS Customer care are sorry... it just sucks), every 2 days they send me a generic email  hoping my case is sorted without them having done anything, they ask me three times the same information, they promise to investigate, they ask me to wait... SERIOUSLY? 1st I'm going to hassle until fatigue their useless CC, 2nd NEVER order anymore with them."
"February 16, 2016",5,From the UK to HK in one week again!,"Once again, no problems at all!  Shoes from the UK to Hong Kong in 1 week. Right size/model/colour etc! Was nervous when I read the reviews, but AOK!"
"February 16, 2016",4,Satisfied with my order,"All in all a very good experience. The clothes was delivered on time, but did not fit totally as expected. I will definitely buy from Asos again in the future."
"February 15, 2016",1,Disappointing! DO NOT USE,"Honestly? There are no options for 0 stars, extremely disappointed with ASOS order something as simple as a cap, order the s/m size when i ordered the cap was in stock. They happily took my money and charged for delivery, HOWEVER i recieved the wrong size M/L. So i contact cust service who said there werent any in stock??!  Why take my order, charge me for delivery and send the wrong size, there is a reason we order the CORRECT SIZES! Please DO NOT  reply with "" contact our customer service team and we will look into this for you"", already done that. Why cant large corporations just be honest??!  I have contacted trading standards about this issue, they have actually received a large number of complaints regarding asos.  Word of advice: Order from a competitor."
"February 13, 2016",1,Worst company ever ordered from,"Ordered a £170 watch on 1st of Feb this hasn't been delivered even though they keep telling me it has.  Hermes left my parcel with someone at a homeless shelter and did not take the name of this person!  Since February the 5th they have constantly asked for 24/48 hours to get hold of Hermes. It is now Saturday the 13th and I am still get the same reply email. ASOS is a scam site, I have spoken to trading standards and they have said that just recently they have been inundated with complaints of goods not being delivered and refunds not being issued nor replacement offered. Lucy sent me a 10% discount code for my inconvenience. What a darl God bless her.  You will get patronising replies from Zoe Rebecca and Hannah wishing you a good day.  DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SITE"
"February 13, 2016",1,I get it.....,"I understand this company receives thousands upon thousands of orders within a week. My order was returned to sender without any notice. Not a problem, its hard to keep track of thousands of orders, especially when they are being shipped through USPS, I do not expect special treatment. However, after notifying that my package was RTS, they did not have the option to reship the order, which again I was fine with, but it was stated that my order which I did not receive, needed to return to their warehouse before I received any sort of refund.  Considering I never received the order, that should be a wash. Its been 20 business days since I inquired with this issue. No resolution. Also if your going to out source your customer service to India, you may want to consider training your employees to be able to meet the needs of your customers, the same generic response would work better with a scripted bot.  I am sure when all goes well, its great but if a bump happens expect the run around. I am out 75 dollars, I don't really expect it back either, hopefully they have a good Chargeback team."
"February 12, 2016",1,4 months waiting for a refund,"4 months waiting for a refund, lot's of emails and no effective solutions, and now my query is closed like my problem was solved. Unacceptable, I'll never buy from ASOS ever again."
"February 12, 2016",1,"The Worst ""Customer Service""","I ordered a dress for Christmas season and it arrived a whole month later than ASOS' ETA. Had to scramble to find something to wear for holiday parties. That's bad already, but what's really bad is paying postage for return of the item, checking with them another month later to find out they didn't get it. Apparently this happens a lot with ASOS, no idea why a big company won't take any time to fix their issues. So I can't get a refund because I don't have the postage receipt anymore and that's that. Not to mention I had to go through a string of different people via email to get all of this amazing help because they just don't let you call. Not sketchy at all. Suffice to say ASOS will never get another cent from me."
"February 12, 2016",1,Horride,"Horrible customer service...... First of all to get me to signup for this account just to voice my opinion was effort that I normally do not expend.  In this case it is well worth it. This company has the worst customer service staff.  I like it seems a lot of other people, got the infamous your order has been cancelled send us your life history so we can verify that you are who you say you are, and provide DNA samples and passwords. Yes it is that bad.   And once you do it, which I stupidly did because my fiancé wanted some clothes from this place, they tell you they will get to you when they have the time.  As the customer I am not that important, as a potential new customer I am not that important. I contacted customer service by way of chat, and when I asked that they contact the dept handling my case, they said no.  And then hung up on me.  Just like that: Me: I'm not worried. I got her bending my ear. I sent this last night, and then followed up early this morning with more information. Can you give me a time?Michael: Haha! We're not able to give an exact timeframe, but we'll get back to you ASAP so you can treat your fiance to her dressMe: No, so I can be relieved.

"February 12, 2016",1,Dreadful Customer Services,Will never order again from ASOS. Ordered £100 worth of clothes to be delivered on a certain day (paid an extra £6 to have items delivered on my only day off to be delivered before valentines day as a gift for my soon to be wife) for  them to say they have two different systems which show the delivery will come on different dates. Customer Services refused to accept ownership or refund the additional £6 I paid for it to be now delivered on the wrong day. Absolutemy abismal as an understatement.
"February 12, 2016",1,Probably ok as long as something doesn't go wrong,"ASOS are useless if anything goes wrong. They offer next day delivery if an order is placed by midnight (Mon - Fri) but when the delivery company lies about delivering your package you have to wait 48 hours for them to ""investigate"" then 48 hours for them to request another parcel is dispatched."
"February 11, 2016",1,Difficult experience,"They sent me an order with no return form. I found it hard to access info on how to return and laborious to fill out form. I tried multiple times to complain but they sent me round in circles. I had a ridiculous chat with a member of staff who wasted hours of my life. Hours of my life gone to a ridiculous conversation where she avoided giving me the info I needed. I emailed a member of staff multiple times to ask where to direct my complaint to but she ignored me! CEO if this were my company I'd want to hear this customers story. Contact me! 1st march - no contact made."
"February 11, 2016",1,WONT RESEND WRONG ITEM,The worst customer service I have ever received. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!! They sent me the wrong item and make it my responsibility to sort it out. Appauling
"February 11, 2016",1,ASOS vs Harvard,"This has been a real joke of an experience with this company. I've reviewed their stock the past couple of years and never actually bought anything, as I do not often shop online.  Finally a couple days ago I spent a good few hours picking out a lovely little mix of things in my exact sizes on sale, it was supposed to be a self-treat to celebrate a new job. I sent the order and went to work thinking about my fair-deals arriving, got home and found an e-mail 'Oups!' we've cancelled your order! WHAT? you are suspicious - (huh? why?) send us your most private bank statements, copy of passport, etc, and we'll think about letting you join our very exclusive club (well they more or less said that). Needless to say, I'm definitely not cool enough for ASOS. I called the (disgustingly useless) customer service number, and was told that none of those items would be reserved, and that I would have to wait 48 hours for an (automated) response.  Bull Sh**^Oi45o682096829405869024586t.  (excessive I know ^, but it goes on)  So I wrote to ASOS, after first sending all those PRIVATE documents, obviously a bit flustered (though I can confirm, still polite - i know to keep my cool, but ugh I've lost it now)...explaining why I was flustered, namely the fact that they are NON-contactable (except by e-mails ...which all seem automated as well), and that this whole situation of waiting 48 hours when I had paid originally for 24 hour expedited shipping (which ultimately I was not charged in lieu of cancellation, but it is the idea that I made my order with the need of receiving it quickly). I asked if someone could respond to me more quickly.  And someone did.  Quite cynically and vulgarly might I add. Faye. damn you. and Ramana too (who later reiterated Faye's words in a soulless identical response to a rather poetic effort made to contact them via Facebook. f&P%@^@$%^ck.)  Faye (and Ramana identically later)Hello -------, Thanks for getting in touch about your ASOS account. With the information you’ve provided and after an assessment of your account we’ve taken the decision to close your ASOS account. This means we’re unable to accept any further orders on this account and any other account opened in the future with your details. If any orders are placed we will have no choice but to cancel them, and no further notification will be sent. I appreciate you may find this frustrating; however I hope you can understand that this is a business decision. Best wishes, Faye ----  WHAT?! BULL SHiiiiii6892485984309T!  I will admit, in all shame I have about the sheer capitalistic materialism of my plight - I began to cry heavy duty crocodile tears.  Attribute it to some buried childhood developmental impediment that gives me a grave fear of both abandonment and/or rejection, but darnnit this felt both like abandonment and rejection - from one of the most trendy, best-priced, most-used companies for our sheer capitalistic materialistic fixes.  And I was not, am not, will not, ever be accepted in the club.  Now you might say - make a different e-mail. Called customer service, informed me that doing so will not work - they will delete that account, and anything attached with my name, my address, my bank card.  So then, in last resort to find a ticket to the party, my mother created an account with her name, her details, ordered me a couple of my things - said here baby be my valentine, feel good about yourself in some nice new clothes. She makes the delivery address mine, but addressed to my boyfriend, just so that the puppies won't start huffing like crazy.  Wakes up, new e-mail, ASOS  'Oups! we've cancelled your order.' etc etc etc or basically, 'hey mama-cow don't know if it wasn't clear before but if your baby's milk is polluted that means your's is too and we ain't making no mcFlurries with that shiiiiiiiiiii928456908t so gets on outta here. No synthetic disposable clothing will protect your baby-cow's skin and serve as a background to her polysynthetic nights wasting away on the eve of the wasting away of this sheer capitalistic materialistic Mondial breakdown."" AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  I never applied for Harvard, because I thought the chances of my acceptance were too stressfully slim and in the end- I tend to flourish outside realms of exclusivity. So dammit, I definitely should not have set hopes on my SAT scores appeasing ASOS.  Ciao!"
"February 11, 2016",1,"Order never received, lost my money, poor customer service","I have been contacting ASOS by email and phone constantly for over 5 weeks since my order never arrived. The DPD driver signed for it, and the package never turned up. After proving this by comparing the signature taken for this delivery with my other DPD signatures, they said that this is a legal issue between me and the driver. There is nothing they can do about it. The customer service team are useless. They ask the same questions over and over again, and in the end there is no outcome.  It has been a complete waste of time. I used to shop here frequently. I would not again."
"February 09, 2016",1,WILL NEVER ORDER FROM ASOS AGAIN,"Order has been made on 29th Dec, with an estimated arrival date of Jan 14-Jan 28. Package has yet to arrive and it is already 8th of Feb. Requested them to check the status, and was just told to wait for 2 more weeks. Asked me to verify the shipping address over and over again.  Useless and untrustworthy. You can expect robotic, scripted replies from their customer service reps that will get you absolutely nowhere. And oh, since these are maternity clothes that I was hoping to be able to wear for at least a month before I give birth in March, I guess by the time these arrive I would have gone into labor already.  Will never ever consider buying from ASOS again.

"February 08, 2016",2,ASOS conveniently hides costs,"The store has an annoying habit of displaying photoshopped pictures of items and clothes worn. The lighting can change the feel of the material, and loose parts of a dress are concealed through not always such careful retouching. The worst part here is that although you already are disappointed when you get an item/items that don't match your expectations, ASOS make you pay for returning items. This fact they hide from plain sight, which means you have to download your countries return pdf:s in order for this information to be revealed. This can be classified as false marketing, as they insinuate that returning only requires packing your items, tagging and filling out a report and then taking the parcel to a local post office. As most professional online shops are smart enough to understand that free returns ensure happier and more likely returning customers, the fact that ASOS is not interested in it's customer's satisfaction, may go unnoticed before it is too late."
"February 07, 2016",1,Ordered a £16 watch cost me £266,"Best experience from an online retailer I've ever had. Order a £16 watch, got home to find my gate lying down horizontally in my back garden and the watch delivered in our recycle bin. Cost me £250 to have the gate repaired.  Followed their protocol dealt with them not Hermes. 1.	Asked me for a statement.2.	Asked me to email pictures.3.	Asked me to get 3rd party quote.4.	Asked me to wait while Hermes responded.5.	A Hermes delivery driver appeared at my front door when I was at work, my wife answered and found his demeanour threatening. Informed ASOS of this and they stated this was standard practice. BE CAREFUL IF YOU ARE A SINGLE WOMAN LIVING ON YOUR OWN!! 6.	ASOS asked what evidence I had Hermes had done it, I stated has much evidence that they had they hadn’t. ASOS then stated nothing to do with them and they would be doing nothing for me. An update for reviewers who stated I should have taken the complaint direct to the delivery company not ASOS. This emailed received today. ""I can confirm that all courier complaints would need to be handled by ourselves as unfortunately the courier would be unable to handle your complaint if you contact them directly. We therefore work with the courier to investigate the issue on your behalf. As Hermes have confirmed that the driver did not cause any of the damage, they have refused this claim and as such we would be unable to advise any further on this matter I'm afraid. If there is anything else I can help you with then please let me know."" There needs to be an independent body that you can report cases like this to, then somebody impartially makes a judgement. Other than that I'm wondering whether to make a website where users upload such issues and the members of the public then vote on who's side they are in favor of? I might just do this..:) Just for clarification below is the definition of the word impartial from dictionary.com. ""not partial or biased; fair; just: an impartial judge."""
"February 05, 2016",1,Where is my order??,"Very bad experience,promised my order would be here on time,checked the tracking every couple of hours and surprise surprise it didn't change for the last 2 days. You need to sort out your customer service or people,like me, will go elsewhere. Goodbye"
"February 05, 2016",1,Very very poor customer care,Please avoid very rude.
"February 05, 2016",3,Good service. but the own brand stuff falls apart,"Really like the cut of the ASOS own brand items, but they never last"
"February 04, 2016",5,Always get it right for me,Never had an issue and I think Asos have nailed the online retail setup. Unlimited next day delivery for £10 a year with the ability to order up until midnight. Returns service is faultless and I sometimes use it to order more than one size if I'm unsure. Next day delivery also includeds weekends. Not sure what the customer service is like as I have never had to use it and I have ordered hundreds of times over the past few years. Products are also great for me.
"February 03, 2016",1,"Used to be good, Now really bad, Poor Customer Service","I used to like ASOS and they was fairly reliable. But over the last year or so they have been poor, a few months back I ordered a Jacket which when received was used. And recently they cannot get the order right twice I have been sent the wrong sizes, their customer service is useless, with pointless backwards and forwards emails which they take ages to answer and is a different person every time. Their prices may be good, but is it really worth the grief, you will, not might get. Do yourself a favour and shop elsewhere"
"February 03, 2016",4,"Great, safe, cheap and fast shipping!",I've never experienced any bad thing about this website (though iv'e only ordered a couple of times so far). The shipping is very cheap and fast and i don't have anything bad to say about that - it's amazing!! I've always got the clothes that i ordered in the right colour and size. Love ASOS!
"February 03, 2016",4,Arrives on time,"I have so far made two orders with ASOS and I have received both of them in a shortish time so I am happy, except there was a fault in one of my products but dont let that put you off the products are top!"
"February 03, 2016",1,Worst customer service ever !!!!!,"First of all asos sent my order to the wrong delivery address and to top it off I called them to rectify the problem the first member of staff put me on hold for 5 mins then cut me off, I called back and spoke to a very unhelpful gentlemen who advised there was nothing he can do, then I asked for a call back or an email tomorrow and he said ...GUESS WHAT.. there is nothing he can do!! Asked to speak to a manager and MIRACULOUSLY he could set a call back for me !! Just paid for a year worth of free delivery..and will definitely not be using this company again! Down £250 and my boyfriend has no birthday presents YAYYYYY!!!!"
"February 02, 2016",2,Never order from Asos!,"These guys lack of proffesionalism is outrageous!  They sent my express delivery order in two parcels. One parcel arrived after a week delay, after over 15 emails, several online chat disscusion. From 5 items at least 3 didnt match the products color/size/fabric! The second parcel looks like is lost.  They dont have a tracking no, nor they can say if it is shipped. Their agents keep apologizing and tell me to be patient that they will get back with info in 48 hours.  After the 48 pass they asked me to wait another 48 hours!!! So they get back to me with no helping info! They dont even refund the transport for the items that are not similar to what they posted on their website.  So it is  me who has to pay for stupid over delayed orders return transport. ..this is highly unfair and unpleasant! It is not the first time this happened. Silly me cuz i made a new order and didnt learn my lesson. Dont make the same mistake i did..."
"February 02, 2016",5,Years of great service,"I have been a customer with ASOS for a number of years, and have only ever had one issue with them, which was dealt with quickly and professionally. The delivery is always quick, on time and as ordered."
"February 02, 2016",1,Very poor service,"ASOS really need to review their own customer service. They used to be quite a good company but now it feels like they really don't care once they have your money. Maybe they have got too big, too fast. Based on my previous good experiences, I bought a gift voucher for friend, and without going into reams of details, the friend could not redeem it. It soon became a chore for her, and she gave up in frustration.  It was then left to me to try to get a refund. Weeks and weeks later I now have a refund but only after emailing (x 8), online chat (x2), calling (x1). There has been no acknowledgement by ASOS of the work and expense they cause, let alone the disappoinment. And their customer service is glib. As if they've all been on a training course about ways to pacify complainants by pretending to be your best friend with mock empathy, and it's all very cynical. Would never order from them again."
"February 02, 2016",5,The best online shopping site,"Always on time, easy to use, return service efficient and the items are all good quality"
"February 01, 2016",4,Good place to buy cheap clothes,"Works pretty well, cheap clothes and free shipping"
"February 01, 2016",1,Terrible customer service and refund policy,"In December I ordered some clothes for my Christmas holidays. The delivery date was quoted as well before my holiday, so I confirmed the order. The order didn't arrive and then over the next two weeks I chased its status with the customer service team and through their order tracker.  The customer service team told me to contact the delivery contractor myself as they were unable to do so. I found out that the shipment had been shipped back to the destination, with no sign of a delivery being attempted.  When I contacted ASOS to ask why this had happened and when I would receive a refund, I was given no explanation, was fobbed off, and was told that it would take a further 21 days for the order to get back to the warehouse, plus 24 hours for the refund to be processed, and then a further 5-10 days for the refund to clear in my bank account. A month later I am still chasing the refund and my order query has been closed so I can't contact anyone. Absolutely terrible customer service, I remain unconfident that I will see my money again and will never use ASOS again."
"February 01, 2016",3,Shipping it back,"I bought a skirt for my sister as a gift. However I'm definitely shipping it back, because it was of poor quality and it had a stain on it!! Not at all what i expected."
"January 31, 2016",2,QUALITY SOOO POOR!,"Ok for the delivery, no experience with customer service BUT w-t-f the quality.  SOO poor, all clothes are transparent !!"
"January 31, 2016",1,Worst shopping experience EVER,"Wow. My experience with ASOS has been the worst cystomer service experience. I would never in a million years recommend this company to anyone. It was my first time ordering with them (will be my last) for some maternity clothes. I needed the items by a certain date as I was traveling, and THEIR customer service agent told me via chat to upgrade the shipping method and I would get the items before I left. Otherwise, I would have selected the standard shipping and received them at my destination. Well, the items were late by four day and and I had to chase them and contact sky net to figure out where the parcel was and arrange a delivery to someone else as ASOS refused to reroute, refund or send another package. This process took two days and about 4 hours out of my life.  In fact their agent suggested I spend another $250 and reorder everything if I wanted my clothes, that's WITHOUT them refunding me for the first order which I hadn't received. Why would I give you another $250 when you couldn't deliver the first $250?! They promised to refund me the express shipping which I have yet to see as it doesn't appear on my card and they blocked my account. Again, inquiring as to why 5 times did not make anyone respond to me. They sponsor bloggers to recommend their site but, buyer beware!!!! Definitely not a legitimate company with a proper customer service, they're agents are unprofessional, rude and unhelpful."
"January 30, 2016",1,HORIBLE HORIBLE SITE AND SUCH A SCAM !!!!,"hi,  on the 29/12/2015 i have contacted ASOS online chat and requested to have my item shipped with tracking number or to upgrade shipping method my request was declined. i received email on 31st/12/2015 confirming shipping ( thats mean there was a time to upgrade my shipping) email that i have received confirmed my item will be delivered on the 25/1/2016,  on asos website it claim it will be delivered on 14/1/2016 on 28/1/2016 i have contacted asos via chat to inquire about my shipment and without a tracking number the postal mail will not help me allocate the item, the customer service kept asking me to check with postal mail on daily basis (SERIOUSLY???? I SHOULD QUIT MY JOB AND JUST DROP BY THE POSTAL MAIL FOR THE SAME ANSWER = without a tracking number we cant help you?)after long negotiating i was assured a new item will be shipped immediately and via express mail and i shall hear from customer service withing 48 hours. on 31/1/2016 i contact the customer care via chat, i'm repeating my complaint over and over again for the past hour, and jean from the customer care tell me ""I'm sorry if you received incorrect information"", that's literally apologizing not for the mistakes that has been conducted by asos but rather that i just received false information and i should accept it ?!am I contacting 3 different companies? or is it fair for the customer to wait another 2 weeks for nothing ?? because again without a tracking number i will not be able to receive anything I'm just wasting my time! By FAR Asos.com offer the worst and most horrible customer experience i have encountered !customers are neglected, customer care is horrible and not helpful, communication is messed up."
"January 30, 2016",1,customer care ?,"I have purchased a pair of shoes that was supposed to be delivered a few days ago, so I emailed. I got a reply with someone else's name. Anyway I replied as the email requested to confirm my order number and the delivery address. Then the second email came, still someone else's name on it. Only told me that the item was supposed to be delivered by this day and wait for another week and then email back to them. On their site, they say email customer case if we don't receive the item by the estimated delivery date ? So it's was totally a waste of my time and now I'm still keep checking the tracking which has no update for 10 days after the item had arrived in my local town.Now I'm not sure if I really enjoy the item anymore even if I received. It worries me what service I get next."
"January 30, 2016",1,Customer Service Take Stupid To Another Level,"I ordered shoes from Asos and they were delivered by Hermes to the wrong address.The person living at this address claimed the shoes and I had to call in the police.I contacted both Asos and Hermes.Both of them were unresponsive and denied all responsibility, claiming the problem was all mine.Despite going into detail with Asos about my experience, over and over again I got the same  mind numbing response -""Oh dear, that's not cool, is it"".   No, Asos, it really isn't cool."
"January 29, 2016",1,Horrible customer service,"We received an item that was falling apart at the bottom of the zipper/seam. I couldn't find a phone # anywhere so I started a chat. One of the security questions was my birthdate which is quite fishy. Then they said they didn't believe me that the item was faulty and the only way they would refund/ credit me was to first get an invoice from a tailor. There weren't anymore in stock and my daughter liked the item. So, I thought I would go to the trouble of fixing it myself and receive a partial credit for damage. Any other decent company would do this without hesitation. No matter what I said, ASOS would not budge. After all of this, I will just return it. It wasn't that cheap and I'm disgusted."
"January 29, 2016",1,Suspicious and fishy,"I had a very bad experience with ASOS.com. Think the company is fishy...- I placed an order for a dress and was confirmed instantly as usual. - Few hours after I received cancellation email stating that they need copies of my identification and credit card statement.- Received email saying that they will get back to be within 2 working days after I sent the documents. I blocked my CC number in the statement ex the last 4 digits.- After 2 working days, I still hadn't heard anything from ASOS so I sent them another email.- They get back to me requiring a scan of CC, which is ridiculous. - Throughout the ordeal, they also blocked my account."
"January 28, 2016",1,Awful,"Awful customer service! I even think they might be a scam. I never recived my order confirmation email and when I contact them with my order number, they said they could not find my order when the money was already out of my account and I had an order number. I ended up canceling the transaction through my bank."
"January 28, 2016",5,Great delivery prices,Cheap delivery charges (or quite frequently free!) always happy with the quality of the clothes I buy. My items have always been delivered within the time frame stated. Will continue shopping with ASOS. Very impressed.
"January 28, 2016",1,faulty items,"They keep sending me faulty items/mess up my order. I ordered a Weekday  coat, they charged my account, and after few days I received an email telling me the item was in fact out of stock and the money will get back at me in like 10 days. No money, no coat. The order before that I received a unsewed leather bag with black marks on it and parts of accesories missing. Sick of them, I'll never order again."
"January 27, 2016",1,Customer Service is terrible!!!,"This company are awful when you have an issue!!My parcel was delivered to my neighbour a few doors down by the Parcel company DPD i went to collect my parcel with my neighbour deniying signing for anything! Ok so who do i believe my neighbour or the delivery driver well lets contact Asos and inform them of my problem!! Ok so i am the customer yet i have made possibly 25 phone calls back and forward between ASOS DPD and the police oh and not to mention endless emails!! Always dealing with a different contact at ASOS and they really do not care about my parcel or the £65 i spent on goods with them as far as they are concerned there is nothing more they can do!! WILL NOT BUY FROM THEM AGAIN POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND NOT INTERESTED IN HELPING ME RETRIEVE MY GOODS!!!"
"January 27, 2016",5,good service,"their shipping is fast. if theres a problem, they answer fast and come up with great conclusions.its not always the best quality clothes, but it is low prices."
"January 27, 2016",1,Really Bad Customer Service!,"I ordered some stuff from the store and I was quite happy about the order until it was time to receive it. First, I receive a phone call from the delivery person saying that he is at my house and start questioning where I am and why I am not at home to receive the package. He also informed me that the package will be send back to the company. Almost an hour later I receive a text message - your parcel will be delivered today. Clearly, that it will not take place as the guy already tried to deliver it an hour earlier. I chat with the customer service trying to say that it is not acceptable as imagine I would go home and wait for the package that would not be delivered. Anyway, the long story short, I cancel the order and asked for money back. Imagine my surprise, when next day, the guy try to deliver the package to me, stating that he wasn't aware that the order been cancelled! After asking him to take the package back as I don't want it, he told me not to shop with asos as my building is my suitable for deliveries! I been doing online shopping for 5 years and never had a problem! So disappointment on how it happened with asos. Clearly I don't want to shop with them anymore and I would advise all of my friends to do the same! Bad service guys, bad service!"
"January 27, 2016",1,Customer Service not helpfull at all!,"Hi,I placed an order on Asos over a week ago with standard delivery... I have been receiving text by their courier company saying is ""out for delivery"" for the past 2 days... as the delivery address is my work place, I stayed in the office longer to make sure there is someone to open the door... Still haven't received it!Used the ""Online Chat"" to ask if either they can tell me when the parcel is going to be delivered, or if the texts can stop (unless the case) so that I don't have to stay at work longer for no reason... most of the replies were: ""hahaha"" and ""bear with us for another 7 days"".... Thanks, very professional!As I sad to her, I will think before I use Asos ever again, and it's a shame as I am considered as a shopaholic by many friends"
"January 26, 2016",5,Great service,"I have ordered two pairs of jeans from them. The fist pair were too small, so I sent them back with the free return label. They refunded me in less than two weeks which is very fast when compared to most sites. The second pair of jeans I ordered are probably my favorite pair of jeans I own. The quality of their own denim brand is a lot better than people say online and is, in my opinion, better quality and more comfortable than many ""big name"" denim brands. Overall a great place to shop!"
"January 26, 2016",4,Great prices !,Can only recommend other people to buy from ASOS - great prices and fast delivery !
"January 26, 2016",4,Everything was okay,They listen to their customers and will do something when you're not happy. I ordered a pair of boots and I received the wrong size and in the first instance they told me I could send it back if I paid for the shipping myself. But I explained to them it was a mistake in the app that converted the size from EU to UK incorrectly. So then I could send them back for free. And now they even have occasional free returns which means they really do want to know what their customers have to say!
"January 26, 2016",5,Amazing websites with good quality of products in a competitive price!!,ASOS is the website I used the most for stocking up my wardrobe. They update their stocks very often and the price is very reasonable given the premium quality of their quality of their products. They have free delivery service across the whole country which is free of charge even for returning. They have never missed any orders and the items always look the same as the website suggested. I would definitely recommend this top online fashion retailer to anyone!!
"January 25, 2016",4,Brilliant!,"Love Asos, but I am not sure how their own label range will work out."
"January 25, 2016",2,"Great, until you need customer service","I used to love Asos and ordered frequently from this website for a couple of years.  They have a huge variety of products (clothes, shoes, and accessories) from various brands, including its own eponymous line.  The Asos brand is inexpensive, so its frequent use of synthetic fabrics and its somewhat derivative designs aren't unexpected. In spite of that, the clothes are very fashionable and reasonably well-made.  I have several pieces that have held up well through various washings and still look fine after a year or two of use.  Shipping is free if you spend only $40 on the site, and it's usually extremely quick, even though the items usually come from Asos' fulfillment overseas. Typically, it would never take more than a week for an Asos package to reach me.  Unfortunately, I ordered some maternity clothes for a weekend trip to NYC this Fall, and the items were inexplicably held up in Customs.  Because I needed the items by a certain date, and because I was quickly outgrowing my regular clothes and was in desperate need of maternity dresses, I pressed customer service a bit when two weeks passed without my items arriving by the PROMISED date.  (Because the holidays were approaching, Asos listed guaranteed delivery dates on its website, and I was relying on the date I was given.  In fact, I had even given myself a cushion of several days ""just in case."")  I was told that they would contact their carrier but that it would take 48 hours for them to get a response.  I wasn't happy with this, since it meant that I would not receive the clothes I had ordered by the date of my trip, but I let it slide.  These things happen, and it sounded like a problem with their third-party carrier rather than with Asos.  I worked customer service jobs in college, and I know when things are out of a customer service rep's hands, so I just waited the two days.  Well, those 48 hours passed, and then I contacted customer service again.  And then again.  Each time I contacted them, I was told it would take an additional 48 hours to get a response from their carrier.  At no time was a solution EVER offered.  Even after I began to get angry and started to communicate to the customer service reps how inconvenient the situation was becoming (again, I was in my second trimester and rapidly outgrowing my clothes and really, really wanted to the cute, affordable dresses I had taken over an hour shopping for, and for which I had already paid, with the expectation that they would be delivered by the date PROMISED on Asos' website), they just kept repeating like a broken record that it would take an additional 48 hours to get a response.  It was quite clear that the package was lost, and that with the holidays rapidly approaching it was likely that their carrier was overwhelmed and was not responding to their inquiries, and yet I was repeatedly told just to wait.  With holiday parties upon me, I wanted a couple of cute dresses to wear, but Asos customer service showed absolutely no urgency to help.  They did not offer to replace the lost merchandise with another, expedited shipment.  They did not offer a discount on my next purchase for the massive inconvenience I was experiencing.  Nothing.  When I asked if I should just demand a refund, the rep's response was a lazy, indifferent, ""If that's what you want.  We'll just divert the package back to us and give you your money.""  Never mind that I had been waiting several weeks at that point, that I had taken the time to pick out those specific items, never mind that I was a loyal, paying customer with a history of shopping on their site for a few years.  When I expressed disappointment at their lackadaisical response, another customer service rep emailed me back with a lavish apology and an explicit promise to get a resolution of the issue immediately.  (""I will not rest until we've resolved this"" were his exact words).  I contacted them a couple of days later and was told - yep - that their carrier had not yet responded and so they would reach out to them again, and again I would have to wait ANOTHER 48 hours.  This loop would have continued ad infinitum if I hadn't just pulled the plug and demanded a refund.  I got my money back promptly but was completely disgusted.  After that experience, I just can't recommend this site to anyone.  It has its benefits, but keep in mind that if you have a problem, you will be offered no solution whatsoever.  A quick update:  Though I vowed never to shop there again, I've gotten tired of over-paying for dowdy, often poorly made maternity clothes from other websites and department stores, so yesterday I dipped my toe back into Asos' pond and ordered a cute dress that I intend to wear to my shower.  We'll see what happens."
"January 25, 2016",3,Very Average..,"It’s very hit and miss with ASOS. Purely because their items of clothing are perfectly pinned to  the models, and it makes them look fantastic. But when you order and finally receive it – the quality is just average and their sizing’s are not always true. For example: A size 8 is far too small sometimes. Another issue I have with ASOS- is that they don’t really have a customer services team you could contact via phone. ASOS- As seen on screen – is exactly that. Everything is done online, including their customer services. Which can be frustrating when you are looking for an immediate answer. Their returns process is not fantastic either- you worry if your return will even get to them with the “free” return postage, and if you don’t have your receipt you’re basically out of pocket (if they never got your return). The final issue I have, is that ASOS knows that stock runs low (particularly for sizes 6,8 and 10) and because they run out of stock so quickly – they hardly replenish the stock. Meaning you are left having to browse other styles in the end because there is no clarity as to if what you wanted will be back in stock or been discontinued."
"January 24, 2016",1,Terrible service,"I ordered gift vouchers which were supposed to be delivered days ago via email. After numerous customer service representatives advising me to wait 24 hours, I have now been told they have been sent and they take upto 72 hours to reach my inbox. To try and persuade me an email takes that long in this day and age is ridiculous. Thanks asos, I have missed my friends birthday and wasted a lot of time with no resolution to my problem."
"January 24, 2016",5,Fast delivery,"I'm very happy with my orders from ASOS. The one time I had to return something due purchasing the wrong size of shirt, the return process was seamless and easy. Very happy with everything."
"January 23, 2016",2,Hopeless Customer Service!!,"I am so dissapointed in ASOS. I have a premier delivery account which you pay extra for. I placed an order on tuesday and asked for a next day delivery which i was granted. right now it's 11pm on Saturday and i still don't have my order. Everyday i've emailed them and everyday somone different responds ever so apologetically with some sob story and how they have rectified it and yet nothing changes. Last time i had even worse issues, wrong address again, wrong colour of item, and customer service Rep argued with me trying to say there's no way they could have sent me the wrong item. even though i took a photo and and the tag on the item proved it wasn't the one I wanted. Guess i have to stick to SSENSE, more expensive but more sensible.."
"January 23, 2016",1,Poor customer service,"My order was faulty, also they must enhance the colour on their photos as the item was a lot less vibrant so I informed asos, they asked did I want a refund or replacement. I asked for a replacement. Four days later they email me saying the item is now out of stock. It wasn't out of stock when I requested the exchange. Their excuse was the order had to be processed and the item went out of stock whilst the order was being processed. First of all I have already bought the item and waited for the item to be processed, this is not a new order, they sold me a faulty item so should exchange straight away and certainly not put me to the back of the queue and process the order again! They also told me I should have bought a second item whilst it was still in stock so basically ordering and paying for two! I now have to wait up to 13 days for a refund! Just awful, will not be using asos again!"
"January 22, 2016",1,Customer service must be a bunch of 18 year olds.,"Hi!I have been a customer for 10 years and always loved ASOS. Every birthday I got vouchers and a ""Happy Birthday"" making me feel appreciated as a customer. One day it stopped and so did their good customer service. I recently purchased a big order and when I received my order I only got one package. When I opened it half was missing and I contacted ASOS the minute after the delivery guy left. What do ASOS do? They want to have proof of the signatures AND asks me to contact them later. Throughout two days I had to contact them again and again and NO ONE followed it up. I them met the delivery man and he said to me he found the parcel in the van and had no information there were two parcels. Okay, so I email ASOS and ask them to refund my money for the next day delivery because I choose to use it instead of the 10% off student discount because I needed the products fast.  At the same time ASOS comes out with a 20% off discount which I have troubles using and I once again contact them, and they will not do anything about it.  I then ask Mark in the customer service if he knows if they have trustpilot. He tells me he doesn't know. Do the people who work at ASOS have no interest or information about their own employer. To have trustpilot, which is a quite big website, the company itself have to pay for it and I would expect that the people employed would know.  The overall experience with the customer service is that they doesn't know anything nor have any training to offer any service at all."
"January 22, 2016",5,Love it :),"well i have read reviews here and while my english is not really good but i decided to write my opinion here too asos is first and only online shop that i have bough dresses , and at first when i saw the negative comments i was worried , but their cute dresses , and low prices , and different options for sizes and the easy app and possibility to watch the catwalk .. made me try and shop here .. when i got my first dress , the good quality/material and being as cute as the picture and receiving it on time made me stay their customer !! a happy one :) about quality always remember you get what you pay for , and i still think the compare of the quality and the price , quality is really fine ..and bad things are possible to happen too but you can solve it with their costumer service ..i once got a dress which it was a bit damage , it made me not happy but be fair , it can always happen , and two times the dresses were not really fit me and suit me , so i tried to contact the customer service via the site and Facebook , they were answering me really fast , and they were really helpful and friendly ,so i sent those dresses back and i got the refund , sooner than what i was expecting , and from Netherland the return to Uk was for  free so nothing to complain ,..oh and my paracel arrived always on time . well im happy about everything of this site , hope you will have same experience as mine :)"
"January 21, 2016",1,Dreadful customer service!,"Roughly half my recent orders have gone wrong, either becuase items haven't been delivered or when they have, have just been dumped outside in awful weather.  When you contact ASOS to complain, especially about items which haven't been delivered, their only suggestion is to place another order and then return one for a refund i.e spend double the amount of money with them and hope the missing items finally appears to then go through the hassle of returning it and waiting for a refund. So many of their competitors get it right - I know I'll be shopping with them instead of ASOS in the future."
"January 20, 2016",1,Still waiting to find out where my order is,I ordered well over two weeks ago the delivery company Hermes was meant to delivery on the Saturday and didn't until the Tuesday  and then my order has been opened and three items missing out of it and then been waiting since Tuesday for asos to sort this out and there customer service is awful and a joke stay well clear of this company
"January 19, 2016",4,Good site,"Alot to choose from, you get your items within a week or more, however ASOS  brand shoes are cheap but material is bad, advice you to not order shoes from there."
"January 18, 2016",3,Mediocre customer service. Good products,The purse I ordered was nice but the buckle came off in a single day. Took several days of going back and forth with customer service to get a replacement. Overall a mediocre experience
"January 17, 2016",1,Worst customer experience in my life !,"An order placed by accident has consumed over 2 hours of my day without a resolution. One representative tells me something and the other tells me something else.  I would not recommend this site to my worst enemy."
"January 16, 2016",5,Happy with service,"Have ordered many times from ASOS over the Christmas period and I'm completely satisfied with the service.The only issue I have was with a burgundy ""bomber jacket"" I purchased that turned out to be a flimsy cardigan with a zip.Personally I found delivery;- quick, - impeccable,- trackable. However I can't comment on customer service as I've never returned an order or had an order lost."
"January 16, 2016",5,ASOS is LOVE! ASOS is LIFE! 100% recommend.,"By far my favourite online retailer. Been shopping here since 2011 for items ranging from clothes to beauty to electricals. It has been a pleasure and has changed shopping for me forever (no more stuffy poorly lit changing rooms). In short, I have made 100s of orders over the past 5 years and the items have always arrived on time in pristine condition and well packaged. I can truly say no other retailer has reached this standard. Returns are easy and swift. When I, rarely, run into a problem it is resolved within hours with polite customer service. I would thoroughly recommend and have definitely passed the ASOS shopping bug to my friends and family."
"January 16, 2016",1,unfair asos misleading advertisement,"They ve charged me for next day delivery when the ve said it s free over £100 spent,  when i contact them they ve said they ve stopped it xmas time, web site did not reflect this mis leading advertising"
"January 16, 2016",1,Just order anywhere else...,"First time using ASOS, ordered a shirt for my fiancé that I have been waiting for to become 'restocked' on their website so he can wear in our engagement photos. I paid extra for faster shipping as well. Very fast with delivery and excited I received it on time. Opened the package, completely wrong shirt.No big deal, I got in contact with them and returned the item. They said they will ship me the correct item as soon as possible with the new shipping number. 3 days later, nothing. I re-contacted them and they said it takes over 72hrs if it is in stock. Ok I guess... waited another 3 days contacted them again, this time through their 'chat' and they said there was a glitch in the system and it had not been processed for shipment so it will take another 24-72hr. Honestly I was so over the run around and just wanted a refund. The customer service rep said ""OK, just returned the 'wrong' item back to us and you will get your money back, have a good day""....Glad you guys care! first and last time, thank you!"
"January 15, 2016",1,"Really bad customer service, everything is horrible","They estimated my order to arrive the 14, but delayed to the 21 January. Customerservice SUCK Clothing SUCK Would definetly not recommend buying from them! Refund is also impossible"
"January 14, 2016",1,Delivery Couriers for Asos,"I think Asos should review their courier contract with Hermes, they either throw my deliveries over my fence in the back garden or knock and don't bother to wait for an answer and when I do answer they have gone and left my parcel in the street.  Absolutely disgraceful!  Asos are responsible to ensure safe/secure delivery of any parcels ordered from them."
"January 14, 2016",1,AWFUL,"Asos truly are awful when it comes to delivery, I added in a new address for delivery I checked this over several times and it reverted back to an original address. I email customer service to ask them to re-direct which you can do very swiftly with Amazon and they tell me they cant and that id have to cancel it and get a refund. For such a big e-commerce site they're useless its not the first time I have had issues with them either!!!!!!!!!!"
"January 14, 2016",4,Awesomeness,Asos was a great with fast delivery and easy to use website for online shopping. Thanks for the great online shopping experience and great products!
"January 13, 2016",5,Brilliant,"Great prices, quick deliveries which are excellently packaged, and on top of that the free returns by multiple methods are amazing."
"January 13, 2016",1,"Horrible company, dont go there!!!!!!!!!!!","I ordered a dress in size 36, actually the last one, and i have been sitting in front of my computer every hour, to chek if someone elses returned theirs, with could result in a dress for me. an as i sat their, it happened, one dress got availebel in my size. i ordered the dress, and when i recieved it, it was a smaller size. so bad service, i was happy, was going to wear it for a jobmeating, and when i opened the bag, it was size 34. when i contacted ASOS, i was told i would recieve a new one, but of course they was out of stock so i would just get my money back. Dont go their, it is waste of time and money. You will regret it."
"January 13, 2016",4,Good stuff!,Never had major issues with ordering or delivery and anything I have experienced has been sorted quickly and painlessly
"January 12, 2016",1,horrible customer service,"horrible customer service, such a long wait for delivery and no compensation non whatsoever, all they say and keep repeating is sorry about that but we do not offer compensation."
"January 12, 2016",3,Incorrect sizes,I like that there is a large amount of items to choose from! And there are some great deals sometimes.However within the last four times I’ve bought something I have received two items in  incorrect sizes. When I sent one of them back they sent me the wrong size again. I then returned it and didn’t bother to try once more. That was quite disappointing.
"January 11, 2016",5,Excellent speedy customer support,"I would like to thank the support team who recently helped me out when I entered the wrong postcode. It was completely my own doing, however I contacted them and they got back to me within 30 mins. They contacted the courier company for me immediately and got the address changed. And my parcel arrived safely this morning."
"January 09, 2016",1,Poor customer service!!!,Never buy anything from this company. The goods you receceive is nothing like the picture and it is impossible to send it back unless you have a printer. There used to be a sticky return label. That no longer excists if you order from Denmark! And the oh so helpfull customer service keep mentioning that you can print the return label yourself. I have had 3 emails saying the same and they still have got the fact that I dont have a printer or feel like going to the library to print a return label!!! So now I have no way of returning a pair of really expensive Vivienne Westwood shoes that looks like crap!!!
"January 09, 2016",1,A very low terrible company -never order there,"Just because their orders didnt reach me they blamed me for their terrible disgusting mistakes and banned me from the site.That didnt do nothing to me of course cause i would never buy there again but just with their action offended me.For sure im gonna tell every one i know to never BUY thereNEVER EVER MAKE A MISTAKE TO BUY AT ASOS,its a very low company and unproffessional and they blame u for their own mistakes"
"January 09, 2016",1,Poor customer service,"My friends and I ordered a few items during the Cyber Monday sales in 2015 and till this date I've yet to receive them. First the expected arrival date was 18/12 then they emailed and said wait till 5/1/2016 when the package didn't arrive by 18/12/2015. And finally now they say they'll send the items which are in stock to me but I've to wait for them to arrive by 27/1/2016. I can't even have an upgraded delivery service as they ""were unable to do so"" as they stated in the email reply. I can't believe I have to wait so Long. And when I emailed them asking on several occasions, the customer service kept sending standard replies (seemingly from a template) asking me to check my delivery address, ask my neighbors if they say the parcel, etc. It's really disappointing that an established online shopping site like ASOS does not try to look from the customer's point of view Nor take steps for service recovery to help ease the customer's frustrations."
"January 07, 2016",5,A little reminder,"Keep in mind that customers who have bad experiences with companies are more likely to let people know about their complains!! I'm very happy with everything regarding Asos, especially the customer services (I use the live chat). I've always received my items on time and 99% of them were the right size/color. Note that I've been shopping with Asos for 5 years. Don't let these reviews cloud your judgement..at least give them a try if you're interested!"
"January 07, 2016",2,Complicated and unprofessional customer service!!,In October i ordered a bra. They sent me a bathing suit and when I contacted the customer service they asked me to send back the bathing suit. They told me that they couldn't sent me the bra because it was out of stock.. After a long and complicated process I got a refund for the postage of the bathing suit. Now i have to go through the same complicated process to get a refund for my bra which i apparently didn't get automatically. I think this is a really lazy and unprofessional service ASOS!
"January 07, 2016",5,Really Nice!,"Fast, nice comfortable and cheap clothes. Really a great site!"
"January 06, 2016",1,Rubbish customer service,"I will never order from ASOS again. Placed one order with them. Received an email saying the parcel had been delivered even though I wasn't in. Apparently delivered to a neighbour, although no one can tell me which one. A month later I am still arguing with ASOS, each time they tell me something different. No one owns the problem. Completely unacceptable service which I will be telling everyone I can about."
"January 06, 2016",1,aweful,"I bought a pair of shoes and they send me the wromg size and the product had damages, now they are telling me that they dont have the product anymore and that i have to send it back and wait 10 days for a refund."
"January 06, 2016",1,Terrible customer service,"I ordered a top in a size 16 they sent me out a size 8. They said they would fix it but couldn't because the top is now out of stock. I paid for it when the top was in stock, I should have got this!! Very bad customer service!! I have now to pay to send it back and wait on a refund!!"
"January 06, 2016",5,Obsessed with Asos,"I seriously love ASOS. I recommend it to everyone!! I make atleast 15-20 purchases a year on ASOS and wish I could make more. Their sizing is so consistent - so much so that they've even spoiled me to expecting the same from other retailers which is not the case. I have made returns because they do offer free returns so I tend to order alot and then maybe rethink it afterwards. Never had a problem with returns. In the one instance where I did not receive confirmation of my return, I reached out and they issued my refund within a couple of days. Their quality is great and I received my order before the holidays in perfect timing. Not sure about all these negative reviews, perhaps location matters? I live in NY and I've been fortunate with all of my deliveries from ASOS. Highly highly recommend!!!!"
"January 05, 2016",3,Standards have fallen...,"Hello everyone!I bought a bag on November 11 and when it arrived a month later (!!! I live in Greece not the North Pole) it wasnt the one i had bought. Oh well! I thought. Mistakes are for humans....so i send them an email explaining the problem and i too sent pictures, one of the bag i wanted and one of the one i got (this is crucial). Kind apologies and reassurements that they got it and would send the correct item to me. (Which i wanted for Christmas, but what the fairy...it is Christmas after all...) Yesterday i got the SAME BAG from them. You know , the one i said i didnt want... It wasnt expensive but it was a good bargain and i REALLY wanted it. Ever since summer the services prices shipping products and the whole experience has taken a turn for the worse. Shipping was always bad and things tend to get lost very often on the way to me but i always got replacements. And i have received wrong or faulty items often enough for my liking. I used to buy very often for six years from them but i am not happy anymore. The experience is just not the same and i guess i am frustrated not knowing whether i will receive the item and if it will be the one i bought. I must say though that they always are very helpful and willing to help. I feel safe in that aspect.i hope this helps"
"January 04, 2016",1,No service,I ordered products for Christmas and they confirmed that I would get them 5 days before Christmas Eve. Today on january 4 I still haven't got them and there is no track and trace info on the package. No Christmas presents for my kids and no clear answer about when they can expect to get them. My advice: Asos has some good product but dont use them is you have a fixed delievery date
"January 04, 2016",2,Don't pay extra for Express!,"I ordered a dress before Christmas and paid extra for express shipping, as the site stated it would arrive on or before the 31st of December (I wanted to wear it for my birthday which was 2 days ago). Still waiting... I haven't paid express before and I won't again, what a waste of money! I understand it is a busy Christmas period but please don't put on your site that it will arrive before a certain date and charge extra, when it never does!"
"mber 31, 2015",2,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!,"ASOS sucks. I placed an order and paid for the $29 2-day shipping. My order is scheduled for delivery 10 days from the order date. Contacted Customer Service and they tell me I still need to select Express Shipping somewhere and my order clearly shows I selected the 2-day option. I even sent them a photo of the order. They still say it's may fault and ""too bad""."
"mber 29, 2015",1,Worst customer service EVER,"I ordered a coat that I fell in love with and when it arrived it was not as described. No hook and closures. They said that the description   did not say that, and I sent them the copy. I countered saying that I loved the coat, but it would cost me 20 dollars to have proper closures put in. They said they could not refund me  the money, for me just to return the coat. I counter offered saying give me a 20 dollar STORE CREDIT, that I had my eye on something else for 100 so it would be 80 dollars. They said no. I think because it is a UK site that they really don't get what customer service is all about. So I'm returning the coats, the boots and the poncho all adding up to 300 dollars   plus the potential of buying something else. They would rather lose a long time customer. No wonder their stock  is tanking."
"mber 29, 2015",1,Wake up ASOS,"I've always been a happy costumer ordering from ASOS. Until now... I ordered a pair of shoes a week before Christmas to wear at Christmas eve. Instead I got sent a dress in a size XS. I contacted costumer service and they told me to send the dress back and said they would send me the shoes I ordered in the first place. Now I got an email saying the item is out of stock.  Not going to order from ASOS again. This is just not okay."
"mber 29, 2015",1,Pathetic service ever,I have ordered a jumpsuit which was suppose to arrive within 10 days. On 08th day after contacting them i got to know that it has been returned by the delivery provider because of no reason. My product was returned without even contacting me. And when i contacted the customer service team of ASOS they have given me 3 different reasons. First they said that they require the photo identity then they said they require me to pay more for custom charges (there were none) then they said it has been returned because of their technical fault. The product never came to me and has been returned by their delivery company. Nobody contacted me ever to deliver the product. This is the worst online shopping experience i had. and icing on the cake is their customer service team which is useless. they keep on sending the automated reply even if you try contacting them for help. My suggestion not to buy anything from ASOS your money will be stuck.
"mber 29, 2015",4,As promised.,Got my package as promised. Slow shipping.
"mber 28, 2015",1,Not impressed,"A company which will constantly contact you to tempt you to buy.Childish customer sales techniques to get foolish people to part with money. Watch how they contact you around pay day and make wasting money seem like a laughing matter. Twitter, etc.Save over spending, you'll appreciate it in the long run!"
"mber 28, 2015",2,DONT KNOW,My package comes in Wednesday but i got the wrong size I will have to send it back unfortunately.
"mber 28, 2015",1,Scammers,"I Dident recive my package from them and they dident agree to send me a new one  Dont trust them"
"mber 27, 2015",1,Worst site possible to shop online,I have lost 1 month of my time and money for Asos who have lost my package. They weren't even able to help me and after agreeing to send me another pair of shoes they reimbursed me without my consent!!!! Do not order unless you want to loose valuable time and money on idiots
"mber 27, 2015",1,the worst online shopping experience i have ever encountered...,"i have ordered an item on november the 15', the package was supposed to arrive on december the 3' and it didn't.i gave them another 20 days befor connecting them because of the holidays and the winter sale i assumed it could take longer for the item to arrive....i got an answer a day after saying the customer service is checking my request on knowing where is my package, only to discover a few days later thet ""it was lost"" on the way to me. i requested a refund but the customer service said it was already sent to me again (this morning and it cant be undone), so i requested an express delivery since i have waited for too long, and a tracking number so it wont get lost again, only to find out thet they had send it via standard shipping (again) and it cant be refunded unless i will order the item again and than they would able to refund me on the express delivery cost if i will send back the standard shipping one once i got it.i refused to do so (can you blame me?).although i did let them know that this is by far the worst online shopping experince i have ever had the word ""sorry"" is all that i got and a following email said that they hope i keep doing buissnes whith them in the future,i geusse that for them it's legit that one needs to wait a month and a half for an item to arrive without any compensation.the least that i have expected is that the package will be send to me via express shipping and with a tracking number this time as it cost 70$ (ish) and not having to wait yet another month or so...if it will arrive eventually.i should have read the reviews before....very disappointed."
"mber 26, 2015",5,Love them!,"A lot of people have problems with delivery dates, sometimes it takes a bit longer, sometimes i get my order in 5 days, but usually it takes around 2 weeks (i live in Croatia so i have to have more patience :) ) customer service has always been good, even with returns, and only one order was really late - they sent a replacement so i had to return it because i got double the items that i ordered - again no problem! I have been shopping with them for years and i absolutely LOVE them! my friends also order from them all the time, and they have never had issues....People mostly complain that somebody else signed for their parcel and that they never recived it...not asos's problem, i can't imagine what postman would let your neighbour sign for you, maybe a family member that lives with you, but never a random person?! (i don't know how delivery works in other countries)I think they're GREAT, but i'm used to waiting for online orders since i live far away from most shops....and i always order christmas gifts a month in advance - because it's the holidays and everybody is ordering stuff, things get a lot slower... The short version = this site is my favorite, and i never worry when i order with them!!"
"mber 25, 2015",2,Way too late,"I got my shoes 200% later than expcted. They said max 8 days, and 24 days went by before i got em. And when i confronted them with it, they just said that i should wait, and tried to come around it."
"mber 24, 2015",1,Don't use,"If you expect your parcel to arrive within a month or good customer service when it doesn't then please shop elsewhere - 10+ emails and 25 days later I have no item, no refund and nothing but fobbing off emails"
"mber 24, 2015",5,Only order once and was More than Happy,"ASOS seemed like a cool site and I wanted to order some things for this party I am attending. The app is pretty cool, and some stuff on there are a bit pricey but they seem fair. I order some pants and a dress for my wife and they literally came in 2 days. I paid and extra $6.00 for delivery before 12/29. and they came before the $12.00 shipping date. I was more than pleased with everything! That was my 1st time buying and will not be my last! I am an US buyer and everything was great!"
"mber 23, 2015",1,The Worst Customer Service I Have Ever Experienced,"My parcel was apparently signed for by 'a gentleman' according to DPD, yet no mention of who this gentleman is and nobody in my apartment buiding knows who it is either. After being told to wait one more day over and over, Asos have now come back and said 'the package was signed for, if you dont like it go to your bank'. No explanation of who this person is requested from DPD, just the fact that Asos now have my money and dont really care that I haven't received my item. They have not advised me any information from DPD and refuse to give me any management details to contact. Never Again."
"mber 23, 2015",1,dont use this company,"ordered a suit 13th December didn't arrive when promised 17th December. Called customer service, only available via messaging, told it would take 2 days to get update from courier (Hermes) asked to speak to manager , non available, looks like orders been lost no one at ASOS gives a ****, had to cancelled order, no Christmas present for son. Now waiting to see if refund goes through . do yourself a favour go somewhere else"
"mber 23, 2015",1,WORST WORST WORST,"Since I was placing an order from India , I had to pay custom charges beforehand to the carrier ,which I did. The required amount got deducted from my account and I didn't even receive a confirmation message/email from them. Its been 5 days ,there is no update on the status of the parcel.When inquired about the same ,the customer care sends you messages  about their delivery ,return and refund policy rather than having a look into the exact problem.I would suggest you guys to never order from this website ""ASOS  It is INCONSIDERATE of YOU to keep ME waiting."
"mber 22, 2015",1,NEVER AGAIN! I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS!,"Ordered clothes for our holiday on next day delivery. Our holiday is tomorrow and still nothing. We've been waiting 2 days. The worst of it is they use UKMAIL who are a bunch of useless liars and it must be run by cowboys!  Anyway, it's too late for new clothes now. I'm going to make sure that everybody knows via social media and every other avenue not to order from ASOS!"
"mber 22, 2015",1,Avoid at all costs!,I never received what I ordered and paid for. Asos Customer Service failed to give me a proper solution. They really don't care at all about their customers. Twitter is flooded with negative messages. Avoid at all costs!
"mber 22, 2015",1,Shocking shocking SHOCKING,"Wow, where do I even begin? I reluctantly placed an order with Asos after they messed me about after I returned at item. Anyway, I saw something that I thought would be perfect for me partners birthday. I placed the order on the Wednesday for next day delivery (her birthday was Friday)  I thought it was odd that I hadn't received a text with a time slot so at around lunch time I called the call centre (awful) and was assured that my package would be coming, the reason I hadn't received a text was because the driver hadn't left the depot yet. It got to 7.30 and still nothing! I obviously phoned the call centre only to be hung up on by the person I was complaining to. On Friday, I received a text saying my package was due out for delivery, it never came.  Since then I have called FOUR times to speak to a manager and have been assured that I would be called back. It's got that bad that I've had to complain to trading standards because nobody can be bothered talking to me.  Never have I experienced anything so bad and I will never use Asos again. If you are thinking of giving these people your money - DONT!"
"mber 21, 2015",5,"Consistently speedy delivery, always good service","I've always had positive experiences with ASOS, even when there have been problems that I've had to refer to customer services, the team always handle things well and provide a positive outcome for all. Additionally, delivery is always on time (or even ahead of schedule) and refunds are processed promptly. Thanks ASOS!"
"mber 20, 2015",1,Refund only less than half of returned items. No reactions to complaints so far.,"I returned 9 items, 4 of which simply because they were faulty. So no acceptable quality at all. From these 9 items I got only the cheapest 4 refunded. Asos still owes me more than 120 bucks. And the so called customer service on the German Facebook site does not react at all. Since there is no other way to communicate I will probably report my complaints to the police in UK when I will be there next month.Beware of that company outside UK and NEVER AGAIN."
"mber 20, 2015",5,I love asos,"This actually very funny, seeing lot of US customers complained about asos. For me (UK customer), asos is actually very reliable, they always delivery on time, also not hassle for refund at all."
"mber 19, 2015",1,Horrible delivery to US (DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY),"I had high hopes because a friend recommended this website but WOW never again. I ordered clothes as a Christmas present on the first which was suppose to arrive on the 8th. No tracking order, nothing. My order does not arrive. I get in touch with customer service and they tell me to wait it out until the 18th (which I do) and at this point I am fed up because they tell me to wait an additional 1-2 working days because they are transferring me to a delivery investigation team??? Customer service responds quickly but is useless in actually resolving the situation. I expressed how this is a Christmas gift. Don't waste your time or money, save yourself the headache."
"mber 17, 2015",2,You're money to them,"I have this pet peeve where I can put up with poor customer service if I'm spending small amounts of money, but when I start pushing into the hundreds I expect full freight wonderful customer service. I'm a US Customer and I just got my christmas bonus so I decided to splurge. My card was declined because my bank saw it as a fraudulent charge. I was not notified of this until after 1 am my time. Not my fault. I go in the next day to repurchase and the price has gone up. I email customer service to try and get the right price.Nope. They aren't going to do it.Horrible service.I can afford to spend money elsewhere so I'm going to. Never again."
"mber 17, 2015",5,perfect experience,"I was quite worried about my order from ASOS after seeing the reviews but today my worries are gone. I ordered five pieces; cardigan in cotton, cowl neck jumper, asymmetric zip up, lightweight jumper and funnel wrap cardigan. All sizes and colors are correct. Overseas courier was wndirect and my local courier was Qxpress. order place on 10 Dec 2015 was received on 17 Dec 2015. I placed another order on 11 Dec 2015, let see whether it will reach me. I am from Singapore. It arrived much faster than I thought and I was truly shocked when someone called me to say there was no one at home to receive it."
"mber 17, 2015",1,very unprofessional,"my order has been canceled without mentioning any reasons. totally waist of my time.try somewhere also to do your shopping"
"mber 16, 2015",1,Buyer (or returner) beware! Stay away from ASOS and Hermes,"ASOS nice website, nice clothes, customer service good... However they cannot be trusted at all. I sent back two separate orders back to them via their Hermes free returns service. 1 order for a refund and 1 order for an exchange in size. This was 9 days ago and nothing. I have messaged them and had zero reassurance anyone has them. I've had lovely messages about how they will look into it but that does not pay my visa bill or put clothes on my back. How can they not track items? One item was a £300 jacket, the delivery person left a receipt. Well i say a receipt he left a note that had hermes on it and nothing else. I like ASOS in terms of clothes they have but seriously don't risk your money close to christmas with them unless you want to take a big risk. I won't ever again. Regardless of if i get my money back it's not worth the stress."
"mber 16, 2015",4,Went from Yikes! to Well Done!,"I was very concerned at first...had ordered boots on the US site for a woman's US size 8.  They sent a US 7.  I immediately contacted them as I'd purchased the 8 as my daughter's Christmas gift.  I had to send several emails, and the turnaround time for response isn't what we're used to in the US from customer service. The problem is that they consider a US 8 a UK 5, and in the translation I ended up with a UK 5...which is a US 7 actually.  So they sent me a 7 even though I ordered the 8. I was concerned that I'd not get a replacement nor my ""Black Friday"" sale rate but today I learned from Rachael that they'd send a replacement in the correct size.  I sent the too-small shoes back and all is well.  I think it takes a bit of time to navigate their customer service protocol, but the overall result is very good.  I'm happy again, and will continue to purchase from ASOS!  I also learned that when purchasing from an International company, it's ALWAYS a good idea to check sizing on everything before the purchase.  Thanks ASOS!!!"
"mber 15, 2015",1,WARNING - DO NOT ORDER FROM ASOS,"Signed up just to put this  review up and warn others before they spend their money. Terrible service, S L O W delivery and customer service. They take your money and your item never arrives. I ordered something about 10 + days ago and it STILL hasn't arrived. You spend your days just chasing for an update. I cannot stress the reasons NOT to order from ASOS. Plenty of other places to spend your hard earned money. They use Hermes - and you can see why the service is so terrible. All style and no substance. You cannot rely on them for anything. So disappointed."
"mber 14, 2015",5,Excellent service,"I've been ordering from ASOS for years now, and it is by far the most trustworthy online shop I've had the pleasure of doing business with! The items are that of good quality, and if there by chance are any issues you can very easily return the item and get refunded. The quality customer service I have recently experienced pushed me to write a review; Sara and Elomo, it was a pleasure being in contact with you both. Thanks again for the help!"
"mber 14, 2015",1,Items never arrived and poor communication with in the comany.,"I would never order from Asos again , I ordered a dress and it never arrived so 10 days later I called to see where it was and they tell me it's taken back to depot so I ask why wasn't I informed and can I have my money back to be told I had to wait 17 days before they would refund THERE MISTAKE! Then I receive an email the day after saying the phone call was not logged and could I call them back as the person I dealt with hadn't refunded my money and had dismissed the whole situation without refunding me! Never again...."
"mber 12, 2015",2,ASOS - only giving you an extra star for trying!,"DON'T use ASOS at the moment if you want a guarantee that your presents will arrive. I have been on the phone to them twice, emailed, tweeted ad everything else to sort out my parcel. I am now going on my honeymoon with no holiday clothes and missing some Christmas presents because no-one has the ability to contact MyHermes. Sadly, ASOS continue to use MyHermes, who would not speak to me as the customer (as they are contracted with ASOS) and they do not force their delivery drivers to leave the correct details on the ""Sorry we missed you"" slips. The driver has CLEARLY scribbled out that they will reattempt and instead decided they will send the parcel right back after the second attempt. IF they had left a contact number I would have told them a safe place to leave said parcel or which neighbor would have held on to it for me, as like most people I work 8am-4pm and cannot sit waiting in. ASOS have said there is nothing they can do, despite me ringing the after the first attempt and asking the to email MyHermes and inform them to leave the parcel in a safe place, yet again ALL SOLVABLE if MyHermes had left a phone number that wasn't head office (who hang up after the answer machine message). The funny thing is, when I checked the delivery days, the parcel actually should have been delivered on a Friday or Saturday when I am in, instead it got here early and arrived Tuesday and Wednesday and was sent back Thursday. I am really sorry ASOS, you have lost another customer. It is also too late for order anything else and a refund can take up to a week anyway- Brilliant NOT"
"mber 12, 2015",1,Terrible service,Order never arrived. Have e mailed constantly with no success and no refund. Item now sold out. Never again
"mber 11, 2015",5,Fast delivery,"Fast delivery!My daughter and I order a dress for her and got an email about the last delivery was Monday 14 December. We were already received it on Thursday, December 10 and we ordered the dress on Friday, December 4, it must be said that we live in Denmark and are accustomed to fast delivery and we must say that Asos.com has that. :-)  And quality is okay, we would buy there again. and recommend to our friends."
"mber 11, 2015",1,SAVE THE HASSLE,"worst company ever. Sent the wrong order two times in a row now when they had their shoe sizes listed improperly on their site. Completely their fault and now they are telling me I have to repurchase at full price (I got mine during a black friday sale). I also received another product with pulls and a hole in it. You can only contact them online and have to wait 48 hours for each response, which is never helpful as it is. Stay away"
"mber 11, 2015",1,Asos has gone downhill.Customer service terrible,I used to order from asos all the time.Made an order the 27th November with up to 5 days standard delivery.Mailed a week later as hadn't received my order.Was basically told to ask my neighbours did they receive it or ring my post office to see had they got it.Emailing asos with not 1 person dealing with the situation having to explain each time.Its now the 10th December and got an email to say they have sent the order again no explanation but noticed myself only half the order is on it's way.Now asos says the other part is sold out!Not even a mail to explain I had to mail ask why only half my order is being sent.Terrible customer service.Wont be in a rush to order again from Asos
"mber 11, 2015",5,Fantastic Service,I have been ordering from Asos for a few years now and the service has been outstanding. My orders are always delivered on time and I like that you are sent a text to provide a time slot of when your order will be received on the day. I have never had an issue with returns and always recommend Asos to friends.
"mber 11, 2015",1,Terrible customer service,"I've ordered from ASOS three times and had major issues all three times: I was sent wrong items, incorrect sizes, and had items shipped over a month late. Their customer service is almost nonexistent. DON'T BUY FROM THIS COMPANY."
"mber 11, 2015",5,Awesome,"Honest, legit and trusted merchant! Being their client for more than 5 years now, the only thing, I would like to see some loyalty programs with free stuff for example!"
"mber 11, 2015",5,Pleasantly Surprised.,After ordering from ASOS.COM On Monday (I never ordered from there before) I came on here to see the reviews. I live in the US and I was just mainly looking for review on shipping time. I got a little scared about reading all of the horrible reviews. I paid the 12 dollars to get the 2 day shipping. So I was really surprised when I received my order in TWO DAYS! Wooo hoo! Love what I ordered :)
"mber 10, 2015",1,Unacceptable Business Practice,"I ordered a dress on 11/27 and was promised delivery on or before 12/7. By 12/10 I still had not received my dress. When I contacted customer service, I was sent pre-scripted replies. They basically refused to look into my issue and instead told me to wait another week and a half for my product. Terrible service. I will never order from this company again."
"mber 10, 2015",1,"First time they sent me the wrong object, the second time they lost my order.","Rarely I've been so unlucky in internet shopping. As I said in the title, the first time I bought on their website they sent me the wrong object, a complete different thing from the one I ordered. I sent them back the pack and had my currency back.The second time I (foolishly) decided to try my luck again my order was lost nobody knows where, cause tracking is possible for orders from 25 € only (mine was 23)."
"mber 10, 2015",5,Quick and Efficent,"Ordered a lovely dress, came within the time frame specified and looked exactly as the picture and description. Fits very well to me, very pleased with their service. Would highly recommend."
"mber 10, 2015",1,Horrible customer service! Horrible shipping!,I ordered a beautiful dress from ASOS the dress looks perfect but I got charged double! Why? Customer service has no idea and says it's all my fault I ordered the same exact dress twice when I tried to get a refund they said no until they received the item back and guess what it's been more then 2 weeks and I still haven't received the dress. I will get my money back when the dress gets back to them and 10 days later. So I spent $200 on 2 maternity dresses that are exactly the same! I don't recommend even if the dresses look good online. To much hassle. I might not even get my dress by the time I need it by 😭
"mber 09, 2015",1,dissapointed,"not true size, had to pay 25 dollars when received the item."
"mber 09, 2015",1,Last resort,"I only use ASOS if I have no other choice. Some of their stuff is good quality (other brands) but their own regular brand quality is awful (blazers that feel like paper, dresses that are so thin material it is see through, etc) But what I did not like the most was I select next day delivery, and they change it after I've paid to a regular delivery so I did not receive my parcel in time. This has happened twice. I assuming this is because they can't reach the demand but I should be informed before I pay or the Next Day Delivery option should be blanked out. I also have ASOS Premier which entitles me to free next day delivery but not a single time has it actually come the next day.  Seriously... last resort and even then you might end up sending it all back because the delivery date cannot be trusted."
"mber 08, 2015",1,Worst service to date and they steal,"I have spent money with ASOS over the years, and to date I would never advise anyone I know to shop there again. They took £280 off me for products I wanted and refused to investigate on the same day where my products have gone or replace them or refund me. This has got to be the worst online retailer to trust when things go wrong their end, as its never wrong our end when they are taking funds directly from our accounts."
"mber 07, 2015",1,Exhausting process -constantly disappointed by this company,"Time and Time again Asos let me down. I pay for next day delivery, it doesn't even get processed the next day let alone delivered. I complain to customer services and get passed from pillar to post by patronizing customer 'care' advisers who haven't got a clue whats going on and are just trying to appease me. Even when I go through social media. The clothes and choice are great, the service is abysmal. It's a gamble. I'd say that if you're casually shopping it's sometimes worth it but whatever you do don't order something you need by a specific date because the chances they'll let you down are about 3-1 in my experience."
"mber 07, 2015",1,Very dissapointed,"Had only half of my order received , after no emails I had tried to get it a few times to find out they didn't have it in stock although advertised and I had paid for it , they refunded me and the money will not be in my account until close to Christmas. Absolutely unacceptable conduct, will not use ASOS again or recommend it."
"mber 07, 2015",4,Nice clothes and good service.,"I have been ordering from Asos.com for over a couple of years now and am very content with the clothes as well with the service.  They have got a  nice selection and when something doesn't fit properly or doesn't suit you can very easily return the goods and get a refund. No hassle. Would definitely recommend Asos."
"mber 07, 2015",1,Rubbish,"They are happy to deliver items but when you want them collected, its impossible. Being trying to get them to collect items to return for a week now. Stayed home waiting as I booked a slot everyday hoping they would turn up on one of the days. They never did come and ASOS customer care is a joke. Can only contact them through livechat and they won't do anything but say rebook a collection. You're better off going to a shopping centre and trying on the items and at least you can return them in your own time. Wouldn't use ASOS again after this and advise anyone else to not bother if they think they might need to return anything."
"mber 07, 2015",5,LOVE ASOS,"I have been shopping with ASOS for years and have never had any problems. I'm shocked to see that they only have a 4/10!  The items are always delivered on time and when they say they are going to be. As well as the returns always being refunded quickly & correctly.  I love ASOS, its always my first go to when shopping, and I would always recommend to people!"
"mber 07, 2015",1,Terrible company,"ASOS made me wait 26 days for the arrival of my parcel. After it didn't arrive within those days, I contacted them and have now been told I just have to wait another 17 days before they will even consider a refund. If this parcel doesn't arrive, they say that is down to me and that they will not refund me. They charged me $100 for essentially, nothing. And now will not help me at all, expect to give me 15% off of my next order.. which is funny, as this means they think I will actually use their service again. Terrible company, poor customer service, and basically - a bunch of thieves."
"mber 05, 2015",4,easy buy and easy return/swap if you need it,"I like to shop on asos, as it makes the whole experience so much lighter. I can find clothes in all kind of quantity and quality ranges. I have recently bought shoes from another provider which made it a nightmare to return them, so that I almost thought i could just buy them then. That made me appreciate ASOS much more. in case I don't like something Its the easiest to return the item and have my money successfully back on my card 10 days later.  I have ben customer at the online shop for over years now and am never disappointed. Until now I always was sent the right size or item I ordered. Once you get to know the brands you shop from often, you know which sizes you need to order. That varies a lot anyways."
"mber 04, 2015",1,THIS COMPANY IS A TOTAL JOKE!! RUN WHILE U CAN!!! DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!!,"THIS COMPANY IS A TOTAL JOKE!! RUN WHILE U CAN!!!DO NOT BUY FROM THEM, THEY'LL TAKE YOUR MONEY AND NOTHING WILL EVER BE SENT OUT. AND THEN WHEN U FINALLY GET THROUGH TO THEIR PATHETIC CUSTOMER SERVICE, THEY TURN AROUND AND TELL U IT WAS OUT OF STOCK?!! YOUR TRACKING SAYS THE COURIER CO HAS MY PACKAGE, BUT UR TELLING ME ITS OUT OF STOCK? LIARS!!!"
"mber 04, 2015",1,Inept Unaware Servicing,"I believe Asos originated and is operated out of Europe(UK). Which is why it's hard to understand the poor level of service they provide. I buy designer products as frequently as I purchase from Asos and Mangement would fair better mimicking their neighbors Gucci, Dior, Chanel, Louis Vuitton ect... I hate the customer is always right moniker; we all know that's not true. However, there is zero tolerance for a retail faction with a minimal level of professionalism to not operate their business with a [customer first] point of view! It's inexcusable!Ive spent over $50k over the last 7-8 yrs with Asos and after my last CS experience I will not promote, advocate, or invest another ounce!"
"mber 04, 2015",1,"Great clothes, cant deliver them though!","Absolutely stay away from ASOS. Have failed to deliver three consecutive orders, with no real reason. You pay for next day and it doesn't turn up. You can only email customer service which responds several hours later and get some wishy washy excuse. There is a telephone number but its premium rate and they keep you on hold - surprisingly! Not sure whats gone on there as ASOS used to be good. Now its easier to get the Ebola virus than a delivery from ASOS."
"mber 04, 2015",1,Worse Company to deal with!!! Buyers Beware Stay Away!!!,"Worse Company to deal with!!! Buyers Beware Stay Away!!! No customer service!!! Chat people not there to help or simply don't understand English. If you happen to have any issue, the decision will be made against you and your money, even if you happen to be a long time customer!!! Absolutely nothing is taken into consideration. Most of today's websites have a feedback options on products and services. Wondering why ASOS doesn't???The answer is simple: ALL WOULD BE NEGATIVE !!!solution is simple: STAY AWAY"
"mber 03, 2015",4,Great service and products,I love ASOS for a bit of shopping. Easy returns and a great selection. Thanks :)
"mber 03, 2015",5,Fantastic service all round,"Would highly recommend ASOS. Been using them for about 2 years now, never had  a problem, deliveries always come on time, products are always great quality and also they give great customer service. Rang them up regarding a query on a return and was put through to an employee, who was very helpful, after about 30 seconds of being on the phone. Fantastic company"
"mber 03, 2015",1,Appalling customer service - would not recommend ordering through ASOS,"I ordered a top about 3 weeks ago on next day delivery, it said my parcel was being delivered and they sent me a text message asking me where they would like them to leave my parcel if I was not in. I told them over my back gate, however when I came home there was no sign of my parcel and the picture which they had taken of the parcel was not my house. I called up ASOS the next day and told them about my missing parcel they said they would contact the DPD to retrieve my parcel on Monday (2 days later) however I never received anything on the Monday not even a email. I contacted the customer care team voicing my disappointment with their service and they promised to have it resolved by that week. 2 weeks later I still have no parcel and I have sent numerous emails back and forth trying to get this problem resolved - Just want add they do not always reply to my emails I sometimes have to send a reminder! Finally on Tuesday I was told the DPD has retrieved my parcel and will deliver it to my address the same day. It is now Thursday and still no sign of the parcel and after send another email to them reminding them of my missing parcel, they tell me that they will send a replacement parcel of my order if there is the availability!! Shocking customer service if you ask me!Fair to say I am extremely angry and disappointed with the service that I have been given especially when I am a regular customer of there's. I will not be ordering through ASOS again."
"mber 03, 2015",2,Late delivery,I ordered a pair of 108 boots and they were suppose to be delivered 1st of December it's now the 3rd and they haven't been delivered I look on the tracking and the boots were in lod Angeles California where I live now all of a sudden there in Nevada I contacted customer service through email I'm still waiting for a response I won't be ordering from here again
"mber 03, 2015",1,"After shopping with Asos, I now know why I don't do online clothes shopping.","Clothes look great on the models, sizes are a complete mess.. A 10 is like a 6!! a 12 is like an 8.. I have never Been so disappointed with a purchase.. I paid for next day delivery twice and lost out, maybe if they got their sizes right??  I don't know what their return policy is like as I've not been refunded yet, if they can justify their sizes then I have no faith in them whatsoever, I am a slim 8!!! Even a 12 was abit on the tight side.. This answers my question why I never order clothes online, thought I'll give Asos a go but never ever again.. Too much hassle, end of day why should I have to pay postage twice when someone in their marketing/buying department not checking their sizes!!!"
"mber 02, 2015",4,Never really had an issue other than a few products not looking the way they did online,"I've ordered from asos for years, nearly every time i've ordered i've never had an issues other than once when i ordered a suit from there and it was definitely not the same suit as in the picture online. I remember a few deliveries being a bit late but again as a whole they're pretty good at getting things to you on time."
"mber 02, 2015",5,Trendy euro fashion,I ordered most of my clothes from ASOS. It's free returns and the shipping from the UK to the US is free and fairly fast. Great range of euro fashion.
"mber 02, 2015",1,Order not received.,"I placed an order with ASOS at the beginning of September, consisting of 10 pairs of shoes and 16 items of clothing.I received 5 pairs of shoes after weeks of back and forward emailing. They refunded me for the other 5 pairs of shoes as they said it was mistakenly returned to them. The 16 items of clothing was never received or refunded. They gave me many excuses, empty promises and kept assuring me that a resolution is near. Their reply to my last email on 27/11 informed me that the query has been closed on their side, even though I still have 16 items outstanding. They have in other words stolen my money. They have committed fraud! This company needs to be shutdown."
"mber 02, 2015",5,So far so good...,"At first i got worried when i read all the bad feedbacks regarding asos coz it's my first time to order and im expecting 2 deliveries on dec 03 and dec17. I emailed(windirect/anchato) regarding my 1st package when can i receive them, because it was already schedule for delivery since nov 30 based on the delivery tracking. they replied to my email very fast and inform me that today i'll receive it.  and they were right i just got my package today, one day ahead from the delivery schedule.. Lets see for my 2nd package if there will be no problem because that one is not trackable. but for now im satisfied customer from singapore."
"mber 02, 2015",1,Customer Service from Hell,"My parcel was not delivered and when I asked ASOS to send me other items or refund me they stalled, refused to escalate my complaint, lied to me about the fact that the parcel had been tracked. Was referred to ASOS by the Mamamia network who said that ASOS made everything so easy. Boy were they wrong. I asked for the contact details of a person within this organization that I could escalate my complaint to, because they kept telling me to wait 1 week before they would do anything about it, the customer service representative ignored my request (THREE TIMES) and gave me stock standard answers to add fuel to the fire. I paid them $189 and have nothing to show for it 16 days later and ASOS is not even going to try to remedy my complaint for 1 week. If there was a star less than 1 they should get it."
"mber 01, 2015",5,Best online fashion store out there!,"Asos is not only the online fashion store that i use the most, it is the one that has the best range of choices and a very fast shipping. I live in Denmark and my clothes usually arrive within a week, which is great. I have never experienced any problems with them and trust them with a lot of purchases. I have only had to send something back once, because it didn't fit, and i got my money back right away when they received it. I love Asos, and it is definetely my go to store for online shopping."
"mber 01, 2015",2,I'm Truly Shocked.,"So I orderd an item that hadn't arrived on time, so I sent an e-mail message, that it's been too long since my original date of arrival. ASOS costumer service just decided to BLOCK my account, and now I can't contact with them no more, and can't order from them no more from any account, they blocked my address too. What kind of a service is this? Disappointed!"
"mber 01, 2015",5,ASOS is love,"So far I have made 4 orders with ASOS, and the experience has been great. The items always come intact and are of good quality (even the books). Already did my Christmas shopping with them and I'm over the moon with the items and how fast the delivery is.I do know for a fact that they use Hermes (they're awful as carriers but that's not really the company's fault) as a carrier and that's why I always use Click & Collect either from a Boots store or the local off licence.The returns are also quite simple and fast unless you return something during busy periods like after black friday or christmas.Overall I'm very pleased and I will 100% order again and again."
"mber 01, 2015",5,Great company,"Honestly cannot fault ASOS.The quality of everything on the website is of high standard. Their communication skills are excellent, always informing you on the current status of your parcels. Their refund process is easy and free. Every time I order from ASOS I know that everything will be done professionally and in a way that benefits the customer.  I had an issue with a faulty bag a couple of weeks ago, after sending them pictures of it and communicating about what to do, they sent me a full refund very quickly and were very apologetic about what had happened.  I believe they have one of the best customer services in online retail."
"November 30, 2015",1,Truly awful customer service experience,"Ordered several items on 11th November, items shipped on the 13th and according to tracking should have been delivered on the 16th November.They never showed and no tracking information was available.  When contacting Asos Customer Service I was lied to by several different associates.  Could never get through on live webchat, no telephone number to call and by the 23rd November with no refund and no parcel I was becoming increasingly more irritated but their 'could not care less' attitutde.  I eventually got an email and then subsequent refund on the 24th November,but I think that is only because I persisted in emailing them airing my grievances.  Now I know that things can sometimes go wrong, but what makes this company incredibly frustrating to deal with is the over the top 'friendliness'of their customer services, without actually doing anything to help.  They think that chucking in 'have a nice evening' and 'we love our customers' etc that they can pull the wool over our eyes.  Truth of the matter is not one of those people I dealt with gave a stuff about my situation or in helping me resolve it.  Needless to say I would not deal with this company again.  Am sure when it all goes ok they are fine, but as soon as you hit a problem, don't count on them to fix it quickly."
"November 30, 2015",1,Undelivered item!!!!,"Dont buy from ASOS!!!!! Quite afew times they have got my order wrong or atleast delivered it very late, but this time they totally messed up. I ordered something for next day delivery a month ago and it still hasnt been delivered. I contacted them through email various times and have heard nothing. They dont even have a phone number you can ring, everything has to be done online! Plus i cant even track my order. And i cant get a refund because noone replies to my email!!!!!! AVOID ASOS AT ALL COSTS!!!!!"
"November 28, 2015",1,Awful ASOS!!!,"I am appalled at how shocking the customer service is at ASOS. How is a company as incompetent as them surviving. I have been subject to rude, patronising emails about an item I received that was not onlyincorrect once, but twice! The dress I received was incorrect and returned only to be told it was out of stock, I then noticed the items name had been changed on the website after I had informed them of my incorrect order. I was told I would recieve a refund to which I did not! I had the exact same dress, in the same colour and size sent back to me, to then be told that 'although it is a little confusing this was in fact the correct item.' NO IT WAS NOT! After lengthy emails where ASOS would not admit blame, they finally acknowledged this and said I would recieved my delivery charge back on return of the second item. This has not happened...the dress was received by them but I was informed the paperwork was missing and they had no clue as to why I was returning the dress. And so my battle continues!!!"
"November 28, 2015",1,Absolutely terrible customer service,"Ordered a bunch of things ready for christmas next day delivery, but 2 days later, I received only 2 items out of the 10 items I ordered. Contacted Asos about it to ask where the missing items were and what could be done. They apparently interviewed the driver in a few hours and weighed the order so for all they knew, the order was sent out intact and not tampered with. I double checked with my mail as it may have came in 2 separate orders however I did not find it therefore it must be a problem over on Asos side in the warehouse. I then asked if I could return the items I did receive and get a refund as who in their right mind would pay for items that they did NOT receive however they've just completely shut me down by closing my account for no reason after being a loyal customer for 4 years. They now won't reply to any emails in regard to this matter so now I'm put in the position where I feel like I've just been robbed of my money and can't do nothing about it. I will never shop on Asos again, terrible customer service! I would recommend anyone thinking about purchasing things from Asos to go to the high street or other online websites as I wouldn't want anyone to go through what I have just been through."
"November 26, 2015",3,Ok-ish,"Ordered a few dresses (for choice) for an upcoming wedding - 1 style was completely different to the photos online, one style wasn't great quality however one dress was lovely. Returning was easy, returned via courier who collected from my work on a day of my choosing. All in all, ok delivery and return however items are hit and miss...."
"November 26, 2015",5,Very friendly and helpful customer service staff,"I had an order to return due to defects, so contacted customer service online.I was very impressed with how helpful and friendly the staff were, especially Deborah. It made my day"
"November 26, 2015",1,Beware,"Clothes ok.They use Hermes delivery company and they are disgraceful.Asos custmer service are very bad too"
"November 26, 2015",4,"Good clothing, good conditions","It's been a while since I use online stores in order to buy clothes. I think it is great in case you don't have time to go shopping (or don't like stores).  I've ordered 3 times in Asos and I've had no problem with it. The sizes are ok, they are pretty fast (around a week to get my orders) and the quality (at least of my pieces) is really good for the price.  And also, the possibility of returning the items is a good point for the company.  Fast and convenient, recommended!"
"November 26, 2015",1,Unacceptable,"I placed an order for a few dresses a week before I was due to go away on holiday. One of the dresses was a different item to what I had ordered and I got in touch with ASOS straight away. I told them I was in need of the correct item asap as I was going away on holiday and was told that a replacement for the correct item had been arranged on express delivery. I received no confirmation of this and so got in touch again to be told the same thing, later the same day I was told the item was out of stock despite it still being available to order on the ASOS website. I got in touch again the next day and explained that the item was actually in stock on their website and was told that it would be arranged for next day delivery, again later that day I received an email informing me that it was out of stock in size XS but I could have it in a S to which I agreed was fine. The next day I woke up to an email saying the item was out of stock. I got in touch with ASOS numerous times through their chat option and was told it would be delivered that week and was then told I would receive a refund instead. I've now been told that the only way to receive the correct item would be to reorder it as they are only able to replace items of the same stock but as they've told me this 3 days later the item I originally wanted is now out of stock. I'm fuming as I would have ordered the item ages ago if I hadn't been told one was already on it's way. Upon asking for an address to send a complaint to I was told this information could not be provided. I feel that of the amount of people I have spoken to from the ASOS customer care team not enough was done to sort out my problem."
"November 25, 2015",1,Bad customer service,"My first purchase with Asos and also my last. When tracking my parcel with Hermes and discovering that they had marked my parcel delivered and signed for when it had not been, (and that's another story!) I contacted Asos to find out what was going on. I informed them (3 times!) that no one in my household had signed for it and it was not in any 'safe place'. I was then told that I should go knocking on my neighbours doors in the area to find out where it had been delivered to!!! When I said that it was not up to me to go searching for the missing parcel, I was repeatedly told that I HAD to do this before it would be taken any further. What started out as an issue with their rubbish courier service turned into awful customer service from Asos who clearly have no idea on how to handle a problem. I still can't believe they expected me to go knocking on doors asking people randomly if they had my parcel!! Wish I had seen the reviews for this company BEFORE I decided to purchase from them. Never again."
"November 25, 2015",2,Faulty product and lousy customer care chat  (Order no. 178773497),"I bought approx. 20 pair of socks and 10 pair of boxer underware.The purchase session was easy. The time of delivery good. 4 pair of the socks were however not acc. to the homepage specification. Instead of 95% cotton it was mainly syntetics (90%).I accessed asos.com costumer care chat session to report this issue and find out what asos would do about this. Meet a person keep on asking questions about my account details which i stated exactly as these were. The person claimed that it was not correct. I informed order number. position on the order of the faulty item. My name, my email adress, my birthday, my address etc. The fault was not even an issue in the numerous line of questions.Suddenly the chat hung up."
"November 25, 2015",1,WILL NOT SEND REPLACEMENT ASOS,"Bought a coat from asos, the wrong item was sent so i contacted them on sunday by customer care live chat, she reassured me that a replacement item would be sent within 48 hours and by next day delivery which was great so sent back the unwanted item on monday the 23rd as directed by customer care, tuesday came and nothing so contacted customer care again and she said oh this item has been sent out for you but not next day delively just standed, then i explainted that i checked and the item was still  Processing then i was told it would definitely be sent today the 25th November BUT surprise surprise STILL NOTHING, just contacted customer care and now there not responding to me.. i am sick and tired off been promised by ASOS there sending my replacement and ignoring me now Please can someone help me get this sorted as its causing me a lot off distress...!!!"
"November 24, 2015",2,a company that has gone downhill,"I used asos quite frequently and thought their products, website, cost and delivery services were good.Recently I selected a nominated day delivery as I needed the product quickly and on the day I knew I was in. According to asos I selected the following week leaving a week and a half from purchase. The delivery charge was over £5.00, when I asked where my order is I was told the wrong day was selected. Customer services agreed to refund delivery charge via written correspondence then refused as it was my mistake - given the delivery was so expensive I couldn't believe it was based on a lead time of over a week. Asos refusing to refund the delivery has cost them £100 of pounds from a frequent customer and another bad review."

"November 24, 2015",1,PATHETIC!,"This was my first experience with ASOS. I placed an order on the 12th of November and got a confirmatory mail telling me that the order will be fulfilled by the 23rd. I kept tracking my order to see the status and As of 21st November it was still stuck on 'package held for pre processing'. Worried that I won't  receive my order on time, I contacted customer care and the representative assured me that the order will reach me on the date promised by them.And today, on the 24th of November, I get a mail from them saying that my order has been cancelled because ""the carrier did not receive a photographic ID"" and that its on their way back to them. I can only receive my refund 5-10 working days AFTER it's been received by them.What rubbish! Why wasn't I informed upon placing my order that an ID was to be provided? And how exactly is it my responsibility to get it across to a carrier selected by YOU? And why did the customer care representative NOT inform me of this even after having access to my order details and status?Disgusted by how unfair the situation is, I sent customer care a mail about how I need a refund immediately and will definitely not be waiting over a fortnight for it. I get an auto-generated mail from them saying I've reached an ""unattended mail box"" and also gave me ""some handy tips"" that may help me with my ""query"". Ha, I bet! Judging by the terrible reviews on this site I don't think I'll be getting my refund for a long long time (if at all). Well, this definitely is not my final word on the matter! I will keep reposting this review until and unless I get a full refund from this company."
"November 21, 2015",1,WASTE OFF MONEY,"Bought a coat a week ago had to go away for a few days when i came back i opened it to my horror it was the wong item that was sent because its outside there return time frame, i cant send back now im stuck with something i cant wear so annoyed waste off money!!!"
"November 20, 2015",5,Great!,"I've had ordered from the shop many times. Everytime, everything has been as it should. Going to buy from the shop again."
"November 19, 2015",5,GREAT SERVICE,Been a member for many years and you can not simply get free next day delivery even over Saturdays and Sundays anywhere else. Good for last minute outfit or gift source. The only thing bothering me is they keep changing couriers when i find DPD is the their most reliable service rather then UK Mail or Hermes who drop parcels all over the place
"November 19, 2015",1,Worse Service ever!,"I ordered something with Asos the other day and wanted to get it delivered the next day in the evening, obviously ASOS was pretty fast with taking my money from my account. The next day my ordered didnt arrive, so I had a live Chat with a guy the next day which was a Friday. He said that they will start an investigation with Royal Mail which can take up to 5 business day (by today we passed the 9 days). I was upset but I agreed to wait ( what else should I do as I wanted to have my money back). Strangely he told me that I signed for my parcel, which I haven't. When I asked to see a copy of the signature he said he cant provide it. So far I had to be the one to get in touch with ASOS and their brilliant customer service, and so far most of the time I got the same rubbish response. No answer to my question no nothing. Just a it will take longer and we are very sorry. Seriously is this how you treat your customers?? I wanna know when this great investigation is finally over and when I can get my money back! Do yourself a favor and never order with ASOS, accept you like rubbish service. Seriously I could have a more productive conversation with a wall then with their customer service."
"November 18, 2015",1,Worst customer service I've ever received,"I am so disgusted with the customer service I received with ASOS. This is what happened:  I ordered my boyfriend's 19th birthday presents with them. I have recently moved to Birmingham so my old address (his address) was still my saved address on my ASOS account. Not even thinking, I placed my order. He'd wanted these t-shirts and socks for months but could never afford it as he doesn't earn much money and neither do I so I saved up my money just so he could have an amazing birthday present.  Without thinking I pressed order and then after about an hour, something clicked and I realised I had sent it to his address! I panicked and called your customer service team. The woman I spoke to was not very personable at all and she sounded like she couldn't of cared less about my issue. She told me because it had been an hour after I had ordered, I could not change my address which seems completely stupid to me. She told me to call back as soon as my order had been dispatched and tell them the courier service and they would email them and get it changed immediately for me.  I called back the next day after my order had been dispatched and spoke to a different man. I had updated my address on my account by this point but he kept telling me I hadn't. He changed it manually for me. He then REASSURED ME that he would sort it and that he would email Hermes and tell them to redirect the parcel. It had not left the warehouse by this point.  Confident my issue had been solved, I waited and waited. I had told my boyfriend to open all parcels and letters sent to the house in case anything was important and because ASOS had reassured me the issue was sorted I didn't think to tell him not to. I receive a text from my boyfriend asking me why I had ordered these t-shirts and socks and asked if they were for him. I had to tell him. It completely ruined everything for me. His birthday has now been ruined and the surprise has been ruined. His birthday isn't for another month. ASOS promised me that the issue had been sorted and it hadn't. I won't even get onto the disgusting customer service I received from Hermes when I messaged them asking why it hadn't been changed after the parcel turned up.  I'm so upset because I worked so hard to get my boyfriend these presents and the whole day has been ruined now. I was looking forward to seeing his face when he opened the presents as we barely see each other anymore and now he has nothing to look forward to.  Thanks a lot ASOS."
"November 18, 2015",1,Waste of time,"I spent nearly all day trying to sort my order out, and I had nothing in return for the inconvenience they caused me.  Firstly, I went ahead and spent over £100 just to get next day delivery... Because I needed the items asap. I then applied my 10% student discount code. It went through and I paid for my order.  The following day I was expecting my parcel, to then receive and email telling me that I wouldn't be getting it that day.. But the following day. There was no explanation given, until I had to prompt someone to tell me. It was due to a technical glitch. Fine whatever, that happens. I then got another email later that day to be told that one of my items is out of stock and I am now going to receive a refund? Well why was that item displayed in the first place and how comes I could still pay for it? Due to this error it was the cause of my parcel delay. All they could do was apologise and give me a 10% off code for another order.  Well I can already get 10% with student discount and why do they think I would ever be shopping with them again? Very very unreliable service and it took me about 4 different customer service members to finally be allowed to have all my items returned from the courier, rather than wait for it and return it all myself. I just didn't want my items at that point, I had enough with it.  I wish I had read the reviews before I spent my money with them and I would not recommend them."
"November 16, 2015",1,An absolute shambles of a company,"I have just had thee worst experience of any online shopping I have ever done, and believe me I have done a lot. The whole thing was a disaster, all stemming from their inability to listen to what they customer is saying. They are always right and don't care about anything else. I had the misfortune of dealing with their customer service team on several occasions and the lack of intelligence is astounding. There is a culture of reply to email and delay delay delay at all costs instead of taking the time to resolve the issue. I waited from 20 October til 13 November to get a refund for a returned item. It's already been sent they say, have another look! I send bank statements, PayPal statements, all to no avail. Eventually I got to speak with someone with a glimmer of intelligence via Twitter and everything was sorted, money received. However too much has happened and I will never shop with asos again. To be made to feel like a liar on multiple occasions by a store that I am giving my hard earned money to is unacceptable and in this climate, there's plenty more fish in the sea! SHOP SOMEWHERE ELSE AND SAVE YOURSELF THE BOTHER UNLESS YOU CAN WAIT WEEKS ON A REFUND AND ARE HAPPY TO HAVE TO BEG FOR IT"
"November 15, 2015",1,Over it.,"Still waiting on a refund from almost a month ago, since I was sent the wrong sizes.  E-commerce in 2015 is way too competitive to be this lackluster."
"November 15, 2015",1,Don't waste your time...,"Ask for an exchange and get a refund in ten days. When customer services were emailed I received no apology for the inconvenience just told to buy the item again in the correct size. When questioned why has this happened? I was advised this happens regularly if the item is out of stock or of a different colour. (I know this wasn't the case when on the product as I checked daily.) Do they not understand people don't have another £100 to spend whilst waiting up to 10 days for a refund?  I'll be returning the rest of my order and spending my money with a more competent company."
"November 13, 2015",1,Horrifying experience. Never again.,"I ordered a dress, along with 6 other girls to wear in a wedding as a bridesmaid. 21 days have gone by and according to my local post office the tracking number they gave me is false. It still hasn't been shipped out to me. I've been emailing back and forth to the company. Which gives me generic emails like ""so sorry that you have to wait a little longer for your package"" and we're currently ""investigating"" the issue. They refuse to give me a phone number or offer any solutions. I will NEVER order from their company again."
"November 13, 2015",5,Was hesitant but absolutely recommend!!!!,My package came exactly on time and the clothes are just like they're advertised. Will be buying from asos again :)
"November 12, 2015",1,Wrong item dispatched,I think I got someone else's order. Reading the reviews on here it seems that nobody gets the item they ordered. Rather shocking performance for an online retailer!
"November 12, 2015",1,Wrong colour delivered,My item looked nothing like the photo on the website. It wasn't even the same colour. ASOS were unhelpful in resolving their mistake. This was my first experience with ASOS. I won't be using them again.
"November 12, 2015",2,"Two sizes big, button missing, and pockets SEWN SHUT","I ordered a navy toggle coat from ASOS after I had been looking all over for one. I purchased it because it was on sale for a good price and looked better than the $200 and $300 coats I seen elsewhere! The size 8 was sold out so i ordered size 6 and thought it would be fine. Shipping came on time, but when i opened the coat and tried it on, it was at least two sizes too big! And I ordered down!! It was down to my mid thighs yet the model had her jacket stopping near her hips. This is an ASOS brand coat so the size guide should have been accurate, but it was extremely off. Upon further inspection, I saw a loose button inside the bag and realized it popped off the jacket! I also tried to put my hands inside the pockets, and they were sewn shut! These were not decorative pockets as the info states that there are usable side pockets and the model had her hands in them in the website pictures. I was just amazed at all the things that were wrong with this jacket and very saddened as I had been so excited to recieve it for winter. I usually never send things back, but I can't even try to make this coat work. And I won't let $100 dollars go to waste. Unfortunate, but I'll definitely be more wary about shopping here again. At least returns are free."
"November 11, 2015",4,Excellent service,Asos has great customer care and provides really good service.
"November 11, 2015",3,Didn't have my item in stock,I ordered a pair of boots during their sale only to receive an email 4 days later to say the shoes were not available. Disappointed but realised sometimes someone has got in there just a few moments before me. Overall my experience with Asos has been a good one.
"November 11, 2015",1,Absolutely horrible,"I ordered about 5 items, the shipping was great I got the items fast, as for the actual clothing, HORRIBLE!!! When I first opened the items, one of the shirts that I purchased was broken, the chain that was attached to the shirt was detached. That didn't bother me as much, I didn't care to send it back, but what really got to me, is when I finally washed & dried the shirts, they all shrunk, they no longer fit me, and I will no longer buy from here again."
"November 10, 2015",5,Positive experience,"I have only ordered off this website once, two dresses for $40 (free shipping). Both dresses fit. A colleague at work orders from Asos regularly and has been successful returning items if they don't fit. Would recommend."
"November 10, 2015",5,Why so bad rating?,"ASOS sent me the stuff I ordered, everything was fine, the prices, the quality - the same as on the website, everything was really great! However I had to return my brogues since they were somehow faulty. First I sent a picture if it's normal or not - ASOS replied that it looks weird and that they will send a new pair or I'll get a full refund - even for the shipping back. Do you flippin' understand that this is the best service you can get if you buy something on the internet? Wake up people, you are making me sick, go ASOS! Will definitely buy something there in the future."
"November 10, 2015",5,Great service,"Ordered a T-shirt from them. It was dispatched the next day, with an email from their courier service saying they have been made aware of my order and it'll be with me soon.  Selected the regular ""before Friday"" shipping and it delivered today, on Tuesday.  Very pleased and well fitting top"
"November 10, 2015",2,Rubbish!,Ordered for next day evening delivery. An outfit needed urgently. I received a text message to say it will be delivered between 6pm and 10pm it never showed up. When contacted asos they said they will be in touch in 48 hours. Not good enough especially after paying £7.95 for next day evening delivery. Won't be using again.
"November 09, 2015",5,Fab!,"Every time I order with Asos my delivery always comes earlier than expected, this time I only paid for standard for delivery but was delivered within two days of ordering, absolutely perfect service! Clothes looked just like they did online, could not recommend more highly."
"November 08, 2015",3,I love Asos - but not their My Mail courier service,"Asos is fantastic  - customer services is excellent,  their  web and app online shops easy to use and place orders, their selection of goods and labels -  great.   Their courier service My Mail, however, lets them down 'big time'. If Asos switched to a reliable,  efficient  and professional  courier service they would be one of the top online retailers out there - if not  the  top retailer.  It's  a shame the company is getting poor reviews because of one element of its service, but it's  understanable. I love having  so much choice and being able to order up to midnight for next day delivery BUT Asos needs a courier that can then keep their promises, and deliver the goods on time."
"November 07, 2015",1,Unsatisfactory,"The order not only came 3 days later than the promised ,before or on date ,but they also sent me the wrong size .I ordered a 12-13 and I got a 9-10 .I thought about giving them a second chance but looking at the other reviews besides mine suggest that thats a bad idea .DO NOT SHOP AT ASOS!!!"
"November 07, 2015",3,Not Asos fault but delivery company's,"I ordered for next day evening delivery, paid extra for this as well, I am premier delivery customer but I needed my items delivered after 6pm as I was working during the day. I waited until half 9 in the evening and what I see on the tracking page is that apparently I failed to accept the delivery even though nobody knocked on the door! And I've got a big dog that always barks when someone knocks... I immediately tweeted to Asos helpline and honestly that is the best thing to do, you probably won't be able to get hold of the delivery company, they don't bother much, trust me... Direct message Asos on Twitter and let them know your tracking number, date of birth and your e-mail address and they will get hold of them. They've told me that the driver 'knocked on white door with glass' but my door is brown, lol! Well anyway, I got my items the next day and earlier than expected! I was a little scared to be honest as I spent quite a bit for this and I have read some horrific reviews on how people never got their stuff or their money back. If you are ordering for next day delivery make sure you do it as early as possible and opt for daytime delivery as it's more safe."
"November 06, 2015",1,NEVER AGAIN will buy from them!,"It seems ASOS NEVER keep to their promised delivery committment regardless of if you pay for express (did so for my 1st order and got the parcel after promised delivery date) but customer service was good so decided to give them a 2nd try. BIG MISTAKE! decided to follow their timeline and choose a standard as i ordered way in advance of when i need the items. Of course, the items did not arrive. A check with customer service again say the item will be delivered more than 2 weeks after the committed delivery date. 1 whole week after when i needed the items for! Extremely bad service. Never will i order from them again. Not worth paying for the stress they always give me on delivery."
"November 06, 2015",5,Love!,Love asos only ever had one problem and they resolved it for me instantly. I have always received brilliant service!
"November 05, 2015",1,Don't know why I gave them a second chance  - WRONG ITEMS,"I never write reviews but I felt the need to since ASOS obviously doesn't know how business is made.  *First time ordering - The picture didn't match the item. Bad customer service.*Second time ordering - Sent the wrong item - yet to see customer service. The other item did not match picture correctly either (much shorter in reality but whatever)... Also, my sister and friends has ordered from ASOS and received the wrong items several times. Are you kidding me? Is this a order- and hope for the best- site? With no other online-companies have I had this problem. You can never know WHAT you will receive when you buy from ASOS - it's a guessing game. I do not understand how this can be a problem when it seems easy to fix because all the other online-shops seem to be able to put the right item in the right box....."
"November 04, 2015",5,Happy with my orders and the service I've received.,"I have made many orders with ASOS and have always been happy with my orders. The few times I've had to contact customer service (incorrect item received once, returns not processed on time a couple of times) they have responded quickly and sorted it out straightaway."
"November 03, 2015",1,THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I have been  a loyal  customer with ASOS for 5 years I place an order on line for $525 and I have always sign for my goods or the leave me a card to collect it from the post but this time they left it out side the door and we where not home we did not get home till late that day /night and no parcelI have send them more then 10 emails /messages and every respond is a different story they asking me to give then a different address to refund me my money.Yes am going to buy another house how stupid they are.They never thought that I have been buying from them for 5 years they customer   service is very poor and you will go t.hrough hell . I have file a complain with the Fear Trading and I will let people know not to buy  from them."
"November 02, 2015",1,Rubbish,Would give 1 if I could!! Don't become a premier member ... Next day delivery what a joke 3 days later and they say they are going to process my order within the next 2 days what a joke!! Customer care team members who don't understand social media and explain everything is out of their hands!!! Please aim to redeem yourself asos
"November 01, 2015",1,Return slip not included,Had to go to fedex and pay to send my item back to asos. Was definitely misinformed. Not shopping on asos anymore. Never imagined paying to have an item sent back
"October 31, 2015",5,THANK YOU,"After publishing my review  few days ago, I have finally received excellent customer service from Alex at ASOS; who finally managed to resolve the issue for me. I have now received a refund as promised by him."
"October 31, 2015",1,I did not receive my order and I did not get my money back,"I have ordered dresses from ASOS. And I have been ordering from them many times already. And I have never been disappointed until now. I did not get my order from the post on Oct. 21  and they told me to wait until 29 October or maybe check with the neighbors and get in touch with the post office. I did everything as told but to my dismay, no dresses for me!  Therefore I send them an email asking where my order is, I got no answer. Then I send another one and another one and another one. No answer. I asked for my money back, no answer!  No dresses, no money. I feel so angry about this."
"October 30, 2015",1,BAD COMPANY! STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I purchased an item from Asos and the delivery guy put my item in an outside building that was wide open. When I got home it was obviously gone!! They are a joke and getting back to you, No phone number, just emails which i received an email advising 48 hours and it will be resolved! Now they are ignoring me and haven't bothered to help any further!!! Disgrace of a company! Trading standards here i come!!"
"October 30, 2015",5,Satisfied costumer since 2006,"I've been shopping at Asos for almost 10 years now and I've only had good experiences. They have a very large offering on all products, the website is great to work with, most products have videos and all have very clear photo's and information.  Sometimes products from their own brand lack a litte in quality but it's usually pretty easy to spot before hand with the videos and photo's what will be good or lesser quality. It's not happend a lot but when I've had items I wanted to return that was never a problem and doesn't cost more money either. Although shipping and returns are technicaly not Asos their responsibilty I have never encountered any problems with this."
"October 29, 2015",5,Great service!,"My order was lost during delivery, but ASOS replaced the ordered items quickly."
"October 28, 2015",5,Great service,I never have any problems when ordering on asos. Great service. Thank you. :)
"October 27, 2015",5,Love 2 shop!,Thanks ASOS loooooooved my mew boots x x x sexy x x x thanks!
"October 26, 2015",1,ASOS - IS A FRAUDULENT SITE!,"Over a month ago I bought two watches on this website. One for my father, the second - for yourself. But I got nothing. NOTHING.When I wrote about this in the customer service, they promised to send me a replacement. But it turned out that this watch is out of stock and Asos decided not to return money. They just blocked my account. I was left without a watches and no my money. Today I appeal to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (FBI) with a complaint about fraud Asos site.People! DO NOT BUY on this site, if you do not want to lose your money!!! There are many reliable sites, with lower prices and good customer support."
"October 26, 2015",3,Delivery service going downhill....,"I have used ASOS for years and never had a problem. Standard delivery use to come within 2 days which was great, but now im currently 2 weeks along waiting for a delivery and can only contact ASOS via email with very limited response and as yet no resolution.  I am 7 months pregnant and waiting on some maternity clothes which are near on impossible to get on the high street unless you want to dress like your granny! Companies should NOT be allowed to treat their customers this way! There should be a someone to speak to rather than half arsed emails.  H&M have a really good customer services team and although their delivery is pretty rubbish also, it helps to be able to speak to a real person!! From other reviews on here it seems if everything goes your way then ASOS is a great site to use but if something goes wrong then youll be lucky to see the items you paid for or any return of your hard earned money - pretty worrying!"
"October 25, 2015",1,Traumatising Service! Have been made to go to Court!,"On Wednesday 7th October 2015, I placed an order. This item was due to be delivered to my home address on the next day (Thursday 8th October 2015). However, I did not receive this item and was surprised to say the least, to see that the tracking information for the order had said the order was delivered and signed for. Upon seeing this, I immediately contacted ASOS Customer Care and after exchanging numerous emails back and forth, I was informed by  ASOS Customer Care that DPD had investigated and concluded that the parcel was delivered to the correct address and signed for  – according to DPD, an elderly woman possibly in her 60s/70s. I was promised that if, after a second check with neighbours, I still could not locate the parcel then a replacement would be sent to me.I responded to this citing that the information provided by DPD could not be true since there is no one matching that description in the household or in the neighbouring area. Therefore, I requested a replacement after a double check was not successful. After all this dialogue, you could imagine my bewilderment and astonishment to see that the next piece of correspondence I received from ASOS Customer Care was to tell me “We’ve investigated this fully with the carrier and driver in question. As it’s been confirmed that your order was successfully delivered and signed for, sadly we’re not able to replace this for you. If you have any other questions about the refund of your order, you’ll need to contact your bank.”Angered with this, I responded immediately questioning this conflicting email – I was just told that a replacement would be sent, why now could it not be sent? After exchanging further numerous emails with ASOS Customer Care , I became increasingly frustrated, angered and uneasy at how I was being treated – almost 3 weeks after the initial date of my order, I am £90 out of pocket with a missing parcel and nobody at ASOS seems to care. I have already been in touch with BBC’s watchdog about my experience and have been informed that they would investigate the matter. Under the Consumer Rights Act the goods remain at the retailers risk until they are received by me. Since they have acknowledged that I am not in receipt of my goods, legally they are obliged to refund me. I would advise anyone that has gone through a similar experience with this shambles of a company to use HM Courts & Tribunals Service Small Claims Court to retrieve their funds and also claim compensation."
"October 23, 2015",5,IDGF I LOVE ASOS,At first I did read all these reviews.. so I was hesitant about ordering but I said F it I'mma order some clothing.. and it came in earlier than expected.. I'm seriously happy. ASOS can take all my money. ^^
"October 22, 2015",3,"Difficult returning policy outside UK, but love the wide range","I love the wide selection of clothes and sizes and I very much appreciate the larger sizes. I would state that Asos is the one of the leading online webshops with larger sizes that are still very flattering and on point with fashion. I am happy with the sales that are always going on and the few times I have contacted customer service I have not been disappointed with their response. Shipping is sometimes quicker than companies within Sweden.  HOWEVER, to you Scott below. Returns are NOT always free, like if you live in Sweden (like I do). If I order a pair of pants to the cost of $25 and want to return these I have to pay for that postage and shipping myself. A cost that will normally land around $20. So it is definitely not worth it for me to return those, and I am stuck with a pair of pants I can't use. Before I order I always have to do LOADS of measuring to make sure that what I am ordering will actually fit me.  I am also displeased with how the student discount only apply to UK countries but it's not really a big deal. I just mean, a discount of 10% would be nice but on smaller orders it doesn't really make a difference."
"October 22, 2015",5,People are so quick to judge. i love ASOS,"First...people complaining about the shipping...that has NOTHING to do with ASOS as a site - so i completely disregard your reviews when youre complaining about shipping speed....by the way, they do offer 2 day shipping if you're THAT worried about it....shipping has NOTHING to do with ASOS... Some of their ""tracking"" doesn't happen...for example sometimes i'll order things and it will just say ""everything looks ok on our end"" and sometimes it actually shows a tracking trail...but enough of that... Their stuff is great...the quality is prime -- the one thing is, most of the stuff i order, i have to order a size up, MOST of the stuff...so for example...my t-shirts (depending on company) i order Large...for my sweaters/sweatshirts i order a XL....heres my advice, if you are UNSURE about the brand and how it will fit you, order your normal size and also a size above...they offer FREE SHIPPING ON RETURNS so you cant go wrong... I've had maybe one time i had to contact customer service and my issue was resolved in a timely manner...some people just dont have patience and like to complain about everything... I live in the US so the fact that it takes 3-4 days (on average) for it to be shipped to me is OK with me...hell, sometimes it even has to come from the UK and i get it in a timely manner..but again, shipping speed has NOTHING to do with ASOS...and EVERY company will tell you to wait another week after the expected delivery (amazon and backcountry to name a few - both reputable sites). Their stuff is great, unique, can be pricey (but wait for the sales) and they seem to sell out of items fast so if you see something you like...GET IT! again return shipping is always FREE... love asos...thanks!"
"October 22, 2015",2,Delivery Dates from ASOS not Reliable,"I ordered a white jumpsuit from ASOS for my bachelorette party back on October 8th,  noting that the delivery date was shown as ""Delivered on or before Monday 19 October 2015"".  It is now October 21st, and I don't have this item.   Even worse, when I contacted ASOS today, they said to wait until October 25th.  Umm what?  Why wouldn't that have been the delivery date shown when I checked out then?  Also, what good is that when I need the jumpsuit for October 23rd?  Even if I receive it tomorrow (22nd), that is still useless, as I need to have it altered to fit my height.  I needed it by the delivery date indicated, period. Also, I got this baffling message from their customer service: ""As there isn't a tracking number available for this order, we can't see its current location"".  What. Are. You. Talking. About.  How can there not be a tracking number?  So it just gets sent out from ASOS without any clue as to where it could be?  Terrible logistics and shipping policy.   Needless to say I will not be ordering from them ever again."
"October 21, 2015",1,Very poor quality & terrible customer service,"I bought the swimsuit for my holiday and the first time I wore the swimsuit, when I took it off, it had dyed my skin black! The whole of my torso was black and it had stained my skin and would not wash off! I had to spend my holiday hiding my black stained body. I contacted ASOS in July about the faulty swimming costume. I sent pictures and returned the swimming costume and was told that it had been sent to the garment technologist for investigation, but I didn't hear anything back and the query has been closed! This issue had not been resolved and I had not even had a refund! It was upsetting enough that this happened on my holiday, but having had my query ignored and closed, I feel is really bad customer service. I have since contacted ASOS care again, am being asked all the same questions I have been asked previously, and am not getting any further.  So bad!!"
"October 20, 2015",5,Good Customer Service,"Don't understand all these bad reviews I have been using them for years and never had a problem, my favourite site to shop from. Next day delivery has always arrived next day and if I'm suddenly not in I can choose weather to have it re-delivered on another day I select or left in safe place / with neighbour. If I ever received something wrong in my order which is rare I just return it and get a replacement or a refund. I recently bought a pair of trousers that were faulty, told customer service and they replied straight away. They then sent me a replacement pair on next day delivery before I had even had time to return the other pair."
"October 20, 2015",5,Not a bad word to say about it.,"Always always always order from Asos.com it is my 100% go to website when I need new clothes.  The quality is amazing. The price range is fab and they have all the new in trends as well as look books to get style inspiration from.  Cannot fault the website at all."
"October 20, 2015",1,Worst experience ever,"A little synopsis of what has occurred: - Ordered a pair of shoes - arrived damaged- Sent them back and asked for a replacement - arrived damaged again- Sent them back - was told for days that the warehouse 'was investigating' - Shoes arrived - completely the wrong pair - I email to complain - told I have been refunded - Complain through my DMs - told I have not been refunded - Ask for a callback as a matter of urgency - absolutely nothing.  65 pounds out of pocket after 4 weeks.  Simple terrible and unacceptable."
"October 18, 2015",1,Poor customer service with little to no after sales support,"Let me start by saying I am a regular online shopper and have even bought from ASOS many times in the past. But fortunately, up until this point I had never had an issue with an order.  Ok so here are the issues I had in the order process - - Added a new address and selected it on checkout but the email said it was coming to the original address and not the newly added and selected one.  - Said in checkout process that orders over £100 get 'free next day delivery', so I selected that option. At the end of the checkout process and it wasn’t a free option anymore.  - They leave my suit outside, wedged behind my bin while I am away for the week.  The responses given by ASOS - I must have clicked back in my browser and lost the correct address details which is absolute scripted rubbish.  - Was told by them that they couldn’t give me next day. I should have paid the £6 and they would have refunded me. I assumed it was just added on automatically. This is basically a broken feature in the checkout process, but also totally falsely advertised because it is not available to the customer.  They said a few times to contact them but this seems like a pointless venture 99% of the time. You can’t speak to anybody on the phone and the people or person on the twitter account are just a joke. No help what so ever. They then told me once the order was created they couldn’t redirect it to the address I wanted until dispatch and it was also to late to cancel and reorder to the correct address. Then on dispatch they told me they couldn’t send it to the new address because I hadn’t used it before.  So because I couldn’t change or cancel my order, my suit ended up outside wedged behind a bin (or as Hermes put it ‘a safe location') while I was out of town and couldn’t get to it. Luckily for me, a neighbour saw it and brought it in before the box got wet and the contents damp and dirty.  There is no 3d Secure card process but can't sent to new address, I could take anyones wallet and get myself some ASOS clothes send to anywhere but I want my stuff sent to the correct address and thats a huge security risk?!?! Absolute nonsense.  How they can have such a disconnect between their customer service team, warehouse and the courier (in this case Hermes) is beyond belief.  Now don’t get me wrong, I like ASOS, they sell good stuff but there checkout process is so buggy and the lack of customer service for such a big company is appalling. Its just a case of one foot not talking to the other all round. This is really not on for an online only company that is so hard to contact.   One of the things that made me most angry was there total disregard for the fact the checkout process is fundamentally broken and I even sent them screenshots to show this. I am a web developer who has built many online stores, so I know how to use a checkout and the fact that they should tell me, you have done it wrong is just not acceptable. Even say, I had put the wrong address in, I hold my hands up and say I got that wrong but what about the 'next day delivery'?  I was not at all surprised to come here and find such bad reviews. Its just a circle of frustration and stupidity with ASOS, absolute amateur hour. I suppose its just a case of you get what you pay for, sadly this time I felt really let down because I spent nearly £200 on a suit for my wedding."
"October 18, 2015",5,I can't fault them!,"I order from Asos all the time and they are really good, I have the free next day delivery for a year option which is brilliant and it always arrives on time! There customer service team is also really helpful, I've only ever received something wrong on one occasion, which seems to have been a website error with the picture not matching the title, and therefore the warehouse sent me the same wrong item twice, but in their defense the customer service team dealt with it really well and you could tell they were really trying to sort it out, in the end they took the item off the site in order not to cause the issue. TBH what they sent me in mistake was probably nicer that what I had even picked out, but I sent it back anyway as I didn't need it, and got a full refund. I order from Asos so much though and that's the only issue I've ever had. IMO they are one of the most reliable fashion online stores, and with the massive range it's always my go to. The quality of the items is always top notch too. I would definitely recommend them!"
"October 17, 2015",5,Good experience,"I ordered Denim jacket (ASOS label) of USD 72 with free shipping on 4/oct/15. It was delivered to me on 12/oct/15. The jacket is of good quality and features as shown on website. Fabric, Stitching and metal buttons are of good quality. Fit is perfect for me.Shipping and India custom duty processing was done by ASOS’s carrier wnDirect. Denim jacket is dutiable in India so in this regard I received an email from ASOS on 6/oct/15 for payment of USD 20 as duty, which I paid through PayPal, after which the parcel was released by wnDirect for shipping. It was airfreighted to Delhi and from there it was delivered by local courier DTDC to my Mumbai address."
"October 15, 2015",5,Great,"I have shopped at Asos.com a million times, and never had a problem with them. Shipping is free, and fairly fast  - I always receive the item before the latest date they put.Easy return, when that occasionally happens.Love shopping there."
"October 14, 2015",2,Fraudulent Activity,"I bought an item from them. The item took exactly a week to ship to me. Meanwhile in the midst of waiting for my merchandise to arrive, i experienced fraudulent activity with my bank account."
"October 13, 2015",1,Poor customer Service,"I have for 5 days asked your incompetant customer service for help regarding some items I want returned, for 5 days now I have been promised a phone call from your call center and stil I have had no call nor help, I have sendt several mails and no help has been offered as promised! ( A phone Call )Is this really how your cheat people to keep clothes thay dont want?? The Items I have PAID for are all the delivered in the wrong colour!! Never have I been more frustrated and angry! Your company should get its finger out and start doing proper custermer service as I need my things returned before I am stuck with these poor and wrong items!!ASOS do your job!!!When can I expect your call!!!!????"
"October 13, 2015",1,Overall terrible customer experience,"I placed an online order with a valid credit card and my order was cancelled by Asos indicating they needed additional information. They requested I provide a scan of my passport and credit card statement as well as data of birth.    Sending my confidential data is a security threat to me, sending this kind of data by Email is not secure and open to hackers for identity theft. Secondly, what does Asos do with a scan of passports and credit card statements? This is excessive and unacceptable and puts me in unnecessary risk of identity theft.  Their customer service was unable to provide any explanation of why this information was requested.  After several contacts with the company, they indicated they cancelled my order in error and asked me to re-enter my order online, further wasting my time.   Overall a very terrible and negative customer experience."
"October 10, 2015",4,Just as advertised,"I was hesitant to order with Asos seeing all the bad reviews on this site and others, but I suppose only unsatisfied people voice their opinion. I ordered an Asos trench coat, it came in the mail exactly 4 days afterwards (just as planned) in good condition. And the coat itself is just what I expected, not top quality but for 85€ that's what you get."
"October 09, 2015",1,'Next day delivery' pfft,Been waiting 10 days for my 'next day delivery'. Investigation was conducted with the courier which was meant to take '48 hours'. 3 days later still no parcel and no follow up from customer service. What an absolute joke.
"October 08, 2015",1,"Waited in all day, 10.30pm and no delivery!","Spent £280 and got next day delivery... Have a special occasion on saturday and needed the delivery, waited in until got a text in the afternoon saying delivery between 6pm-10pm got my husband to rush back from grandparents with new born at 6pm, now still sat waiting and no delivery or even a courtesy text/call/email to explain! Not happy at all!"
"October 07, 2015",1,Rubbish service,"Ordered 3 times and 2 of 3 times they didn't deliver - can't pay to track their shipments Don't care about customers either - simple refund but what about all the time I spend ordering"
"October 02, 2015",5,Amazing Service,"Paid for ASOS Prime and I love it, absolute life saver before I went away and free returns."
"October 02, 2015",1,terrible online experience,"The  shipping time is very long. After waiting for almost one month, I still do not receive the goods.  I believe it should be a lost case but they did not refund to me.  I will never purchase from them anymore."
"October 02, 2015",1,Fake Nike,"I received a pair of fake Nike Roshe Run trainers.I contacted the company and attached pictures of the shoes.The will not acknowledge that the shoes are fake and only return with company phrases such as ""ASOS only stocks genuine and authentic items, bought directly from the brands so you can be sure the item you received was genuine."""
"September 30, 2015",5,Good service,"I ordered a pair of jeans on Thursday evening and they were delivered on next Monday afternoon. No problems, no hassle, and I was able to track the order throughout. Excellent service and a good price. Recommended"
"September 30, 2015",4,Fast delivery,I have ordered from Asos a few times and my delivery has always turned up within the delivery window! Usually before the max waiting date!  Returns are easy for me to drop into my click and collect shop and are processed in a reasonable amount of time! Happy!
"September 28, 2015",1,TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.,"ON THEIR WEBSITE CLEARLY STATES FREE DELIVERY OVER CERTAIN AMOUNT. DOESN'T PRESENT THAT OPTION DURING CHECKOUT. I BRING THE ISSUE UP WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY SAY JUST PURCHASE AND PAY DELIVERY THEY CAN REFUND IT. I CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE AGAIN ASKING FOR REFUND AFTER ORDER. THEY CLAIM IT WAS MY OWN FAULT AND NO SUCH OFFER EXISTS AND WILL NOT REFUND SHIPPING COSTS.  EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL AND PATRONIZING TELLING ME 'THEY ARE SORRY I FEEL THIS WAY'.... I HAVE HARD EVIDENCE OF SCREENSHOTS OF THE OFFER YET THEY REFUSE TO ADMIT THEY ARE WRONG.  You'd think a large company like asos wouldn't be ridiculous and fight with me over a measly shipping cost but unfortunately that's not the case. Their customer service also needs to communicate with each other better. Don't tell me one thing and then pass my case around to 3 other representatives."
"September 28, 2015",1,Appalling,"The so called customer service most certainly has no customers in mind.  I have placed an order for 4 items with ASOS.  I wanted to return 2, however, customer service made these returns so difficult, that I am now returning all items at my own expense.  I asked ASOS about a return address but was advised that they are not permitted to give me an address instead I have to use their shipping agent.  Which company in the world will decline giving out their address (even if for tax reasons it is only a PO Box number).  Which mail order company in the world will prescribe a shipping agent unless the returns are free.   Don't be misguided:  ASOS returns are NOT free, hence I would very much like to choose my own shipping agent.  By now ASOS has had my $500 payment for about 20 days earning interest, this money will keep earning interest for ASOS, the company without address, until the returns situation has been sorted, which may well be another 20 days.  ASOS is doing well out of me.  I have been internet shopping forever, myTheresa, Neiman Marcus, Spanx, Lucky Scent, a large number of Dutch companies, never, ever any problems with returns, but ASOS a completely different story.  Maybe by providing MINIMAL customer service the customer is exhausted to that extent that keeping the items seems easier than returning them.  Good policy for the company, but certainly not user friendly."
"September 24, 2015",5,"Professional, caring and helpful","This review of Asos isn't about their clothes or the shipping. Since I live in Sweden it's quite obvious I'll have to wait a couple of weeks for my delivery to arrive. That's perfectly fine with me. What I want to do is write a short review of Asos's customer service department. I've been in contact with them through email a handful of times and they've always been wonderful. I'm not sure I can describe how nice and helpful their customer service is (well, I can write it in Swedish but I'm not sure how helpful that'll be to any of their non-Swedish-speaking customers) but I'll try. If you accidentally order two dresses instead of one and miss the window of time when you can cancel the order, the customer service people will guide you through the entire process. With a lot of patience and understanding. If your shipment is lost on the way to Stockholm they will apologize (even though it's not their fault!) and help you track the package. They'll make sure you get your goods in the end. If you happen to get a shirt instead of a skirt, all you have to do is contact them and they'll sort it out. It might take some time but who are we to complain? The men and women who work there are only human. They're not robots. They're doing the best they can and I can honestly say I've never ever encountered a better customer service. So, all in all, I'm always going to shop at Asos. Not because of the clothes (but they're nice too) but because their customer support is great. I feel safe with them and wish them nothing but the best!"
"September 23, 2015",4,Professionel,My experience with Asos is only positive. They have a very professionel and structured approach to orders and returns.
"September 21, 2015",1,Poor customer service; horrible delivery,"I placed an order for a suit with this company. After 3 weeks no sign of the suit, I emailed ASOS several times and they finally said that there is nothing they can do and the order is lost. And once it was found and returned, they will credit my money whenever that may be. Regardless, I blamed the courrier service and reordered the same item. Guess what, they addressed the item to the wrong addresss again (I found this information from UPS). So now my 2nd order will probably go around the world and go back to them resulting in 2 refunds (whenever they happen). When I complained, all i got was a 10% coupon. Blah!! They can keep that - wish i could give them zero stars. Do not shop here. Very unreliable"
"September 21, 2015",1,Bad customer service,"I ordered two pairs of jeans that turned out to be of a totally different color than on the picture on the Asos website. I complained about it and heard nothing. I just received an email which said: ""Thanks for contacting ASOS Customer Care; I really hope I resolved your query!"" Normally I really like Asos, but this got me looking for alternatives."
"September 21, 2015",1,Terrible Customer Service.,"After purchasing with ASOS for a few years without any issues I had my very first issue. I made an order for a Sunday delivery before I went on holiday in which the order did not arrive. When I returned from holiday to my surprise the parcel stated delivered so I checked the tracking which stated signed for by Thomas and delivered at 9:30pm. I contacted ASOS customer service to be told this was my neighbour. After checking with my Neighbour which has no one by the name of Thomas living there I contact ASOS again.  The response I got from the customer service was so appalling I just have to show all. If you have an issue with ASOS they clearly do not care about customers, loyal or not.I shall never return to use ASOS. Read below the first response. This has continued and still no full reply from them after saying now on 3 occasions they are looking in this over a week. Hi, Thanks for getting in touch about your ASOS goodies.  I’ve had a look into this and can see that your order was delivered to your neighbour with the name ""Thomas M"". As your order has been delivered to and signed for by your neighbour, we’re not able to refund or replace this for you.  As you haven’t received the order, this is now a civil issue between you and your neighbour. I hope this answers your query. If you have any more questions, please let me know – I’ll be happy to help. Best wishes,  ASOS Customer Care"
"September 19, 2015",5,Fantastic,"Ive shopped with ASOS for years, never had a problem with contacting them, always fast delivery, love their clothes and if i have ever have had a problem with something its been dealt with quickly!"
"September 19, 2015",5,Fast shipping and great service!,"I had a positive experience ordering here. The customer service is awesome, I got answers to a lot of questions I had about my shipment and my parcel came in 9 days (I live in Canada) which is very fast since I chose standard shipping which only costed me 1.30. My dress came in the right size and great quality just as shown in the pictures. I will buy and shop from asos again definitely."
"September 18, 2015",3,Accessories and shoes,"So far so good!I have often bought accessories and shoes from ASOS without any delivery problems .Few times bought clothes and the experience has been different from time to time. I think it's hard to find the right sizes that fit as it vary between the different brands . If you have to send something back, it can be a long process , but I always got the right amount back.So I keep it within buying accessories and shoes , but avoids clothes"
"September 18, 2015",1,"It's been over a week, my parcels lost, and I haven't been issued a relpacement","I ordered some lounge-wear from Asos, to wear during my time at University. I ordered with plenty of time to spare, at least 7 working days prior to my departure to University. I ordered on a Thursday, and apparently, my parcel had been delivered on a Saturday. Apparently, the courier they used; Hermes, decided to leave my parcel outside, despite me not giving them any special instruction to do so. So, either my parcel was stolen, or they didn't leave my parcel outside at all. So, when I contacted Asos via email to let them know I hadn't received my parcel, and they then sent me an email, in which they advised that I check a possible ""Secure Location"" that my parcel could have been left in, as well as check with my neighbors. I complied, but had no luck, as none of my neighbors had accepted the delivery, and I checked my front porch, as well as my back yard, but there was nothing there. Frustrated, I called up Hermes, which was very difficult indeed as I had to dig deep to find their number. Once I did get on to the phone with them, they admitted that the parcel had been left outside (I wasn't given a delivery note) and that if it is not there then I should contact Asos to issue a replacement, and that Asos must claim my parcel as a lost delivery. I then contacted Asos, via email, explaining that my parcel had been lost and that I would like to be issued with a replacement. They said that I would be issued with a replacement, and that I would have an email sent out to me confirming this (I still haven't received this email). I told them that I like next day delivery as a form of compensation for my hassle, as I was not at fault and I had very little time to spare. When I sent that email, I was sent another email, which repetitively stated that I check in ""Safe Places"" and with my neighbors to see if they have accepted my delivery. Now, frustrated and infuriated with their response, I sent them another email, explaining my disappointment, and stressing that my time is limited and there will be no one to receive my parcel when I go to Uni on Saturday. They then replied to me with an email in which they apologised and said that they can see from tracking information that my parcel is out for delivery today (Wednesday, 5 working days after my initial order). I then asked them for my tracking number, and the tracking number that was supplied to me was the same tracking number of my initial order, the one that had been lost. I called up Hermes again, to confirm this, and indeed, the tracking number that I had been supplied was of the previous order and a new tracking number should have been issued. I then asked them whether there was any delivery scheduled to me at all, and they couldn't find anything. I emailed Asos again, telling them that I had been supplied with the old tracking information, and requested that I am provided with new tracking information. Turns out, that no one had issued a replacement, and someone from their team stated that, going through the chain of emails, they realised that no one had raised a replacement, but they have done that for me now. I was still not supplied with any tracking information. After some digging, I found a number for Asos, and called them on Thursday, explaining the problems that I was facing. The individual on the phone said that he must talk to a superior about my parcel and I had advised him that I didn't have much time left. He said all that I could do was just sit tight and wait for an email. I waited, and once again, I was sent an email which advised that I must check a ""Safe Location"" or with my neighbors to see if the parcel has arrived. I called Asos again, the same individual picked up, and stated that he must once again speak to a superior. It is now Friday, and I'm meant to move in for University tomorrow. I am without my parcel, and without any information on what action is to be taken next. I can't cancel my order because what I ordered are necessities. But I don't have my order, and I'm left infuriated, confused and out-of pocket. If your parcel is ever lost, good luck, because Asos will do everything they can to get out of supplying you with a new parcel."
"September 18, 2015",5,Great bikini,A received a perfect bikini top that looks exactly as it appeared in the picture.
"September 17, 2015",1,"Cheap Chinese goods, poor service, no phone numbers...","I purchased a suit for a wedding as part of the bridal party. The jacket had no tags on it and it was tiny, I asked for an exchange. ""Stephen"" was very friendly and promised an expedited replacement. After a week I contacted the company again. ""Martin"" was cagey and would not refer me to a supervisor nor give a phone number. Ultimately ""Nafisa"" said replacements were not allowed for US customers. I'm apparently stuck keeping this tiny jacket and normal pants. Beware, this is a foreign company with bad Chinese made products and no phone numbers."
"September 16, 2015",5,A great online shopping experience,"Loads of choice, good value, always quick delivery - thank you Asos!"
"September 16, 2015",5,So far so good!,"I've fast become a fan of Asos. It's always a bit tricky to order from international sites (I'm from the Netherlands) since you never know exactly how the shipping will turn out. Asos, however, is fantastic.  The biggest plus and the reason why it's now my top 'buy from' site are its free deliveries and free returns policy. On top of that my deliveries usually turn up long before my orders from Dutch online stores, I can pay via PayPal, and the informative emails during the process and track and trace option are great. Hassle free, I love that.  My only con so far would be that the emails from Asos are really getting out of hand. I'd love to get the occasional email about new collections, but it's either opting out completely or receiving nonsense on a daily basis."
"September 16, 2015",1,One of my worst online experiences ever!,"I purchased a swim suit from ASOS in a size G.  I know this will unlikely mean anything to the male shoppers out there, but there is a sinificant difference in swim top sizing between a G and an F.  I received an F sized top. Long story short.  After submitting my complaint I received 3 different emails from ASOS, each as useless as the next.  Explaining that the item I wanted was not in stock, they don't change orders so I must have ordered an F, and finally that there is bra sizing differences between Canada and the UK. Having previously shopped in the UK, and currently living in Canada, I can tell you there is no difference in sizing when you purchase a G sized bra.  Size G is a G! Needless to say after 6 rediculous emails I am returning the entire swim suit at my cost.  I will never, ever waste my money at ASOS again.  If this had been the first time I had, had issues it wouldn't be so bad, but this is the second time they have screwed me over.  So done with this terrible company.  There are far to many good online companies out there to waste money on subpar service."
"September 14, 2015",5,Love ASOS,"I have shopped with ASOS for years and have never had a bad word to say, once my item didnt arrive, after informing ASOS they immediately sent out another one which reached me within days.Also their returns are free and super easy. They are 100% about making their customers happy."
"September 12, 2015",3,OK service.. not great,"This was just ""OK""Slow and items are so so."
"September 12, 2015",5,EXCELLENT,LOVE THIS COMPANY.
"September 11, 2015",2,I am getting tired now,"I used to love Asos, and would check their website everyday.But now I am just getting tired of them. First off they delete the wonderful feature where you could compare the dress etc. sizing/measurement with your favourite dress etc. that you knew looked good on you. This was such a wonderful feature especially when you live in Denmark and do not get free returns, which mean you have to be extra sure that the stuff you are buying fits.I just got my new dress yesterday, and it didn't fit. Granted stuff like that happens, so I am planning on returning it. Usually that means there would be a sticker I just had to put on my parcel and then down to the post office and pay. But apparently that was too easy, now I have go into their website, pay there, then print something (not everybody has a printer dear Asos, so even more of a bother for me), and THEN go down to the post office.  What was wrong with the old way? Seriously? Also don't get me started on the fact that in Denmark instead of using our postal service they are using Bring, which mean you have to pick up your stuff the most random places.  I am sorry Asos, but all of this makes me want to find other places where returns are easy and figuring out if a dress is big in size or small is easy (being able to review a garment would make this easier, like almost all other online shops have). Hope you guys fix this, since gosh I used to love Asos"
"September 11, 2015",3,"Their shoes run small, they mess up orders","Their shoes run small but their return policy is nice in the United States.But I ordered a two piece suit and they only sent me the suit jacket and a completely different pant bottom. I went to exchange the pants for the right ones but they claimed they were out of stock by the time I got around to it (4 days later). They refunded me for the bottoms, and i thought about returning the jacket too, but I didn't. I regret it since i never wear it. I've only had one successful purchase with this company."
"September 11, 2015",1,lack of customer service !!,Way to long time before they react ón returned items ! More than 35 Worning days ???
"September 11, 2015",3,Good but slow.,"Took a while but I did get what i ordered.Good quality all round."
"September 08, 2015",3,Changed delivery,"I don't really know what to write here, since I have had very different results from this page. First of all, I live in Denmark, and I used to love asos, the delivery was great, I always got what I expected and so on, - and I would have lived to give them 4-5 stars for this. But the past year, their delivery has just been hell for me- and other Danes.. I don't know what they changed to, but whatever it is, it is just awful. Packages are damaged, people are rude, it takes sooo long to get the delivery, and now it's come to that I don't really want to buy from there anymore - it's just not worth the trouble... Which it really sad since I used to love it.."
"September 06, 2015",4,love the one year next day delivery service for £9.99,"i buy from asos quite often and i absolutely love the shipping option they have for the year vip service, its great i wish other companies had this service available as well. :D Happy customer."
"September 05, 2015",4,Good,"Ordered many times. Allways on time, and returns are very easy."
"September 05, 2015",5,"Nice dresses, good customer service :)","I have ordered from Asos multiple times since last year. Most of the packages arrived within the set timeframe or a couple of days later, except for the last one. I waited for a set number of working days as required (28 I think?) and then emailed the customer care again, asking for a replacement. They have been very helpful and arranged for sending it to me, even though the size of the item in question was listed as out of stock. It's kind of strange that some people say their customer service is rude. In my case, they have always been very polite and willing to help."
"September 05, 2015",1,Delivery,"Delivery is absolutely appalling. Company rude, argumentative and downright shocking to deal with. Will never buy off Asos again !!!!!!!!!!!"
"September 03, 2015",1,0 would be the right score!,"If I could scored the service as 0; I would LOVEEE to! This is the worst online shopping experience I've ever had. I ordered an EXPRESS delivery, I paid 6 EUR more than the normal cost. It turned out that it exceeds the scheduled delivery; while in fact i will be away just the day after. This is so RIDICULOUS, since I am based in Netherlands which is only 1-2 hour flight from the UK; and when I checked it with the DPD Parcel company; they mentioned that my items were sent using CLASSIC / NORMAL delivery package; meaning no SPEEDY delivery should be expected. This means, I literally pay 6 EURO for NOTHING! When I called the CS, no apology even was mentioned. SUPER UBER TERRIBLE service.  THE WORST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE EVER! I would NEVER EVER EVER use ASOS; and will inform all my friends and colleagues are aware of how poor the service has been. Seriously bad!"
"September 03, 2015",1,Worst service ever,"So firstly I went through a lot of trouble ordering my things, then I ordered for next day delivery- sat in my house all day and the delivery never came. Next when I finally received my delivery one of the products was wrong. Now they're saying they can't send out the right product because it's out of stock, although I ordered it first!. Now finally one of the products have ripped after one day of owning it because I stretched and when I try to get in touch all they say is ""we're trying to solve the problem, sorry for the inconvenience"" and act like everything is ok"
"September 02, 2015",1,WHAT A SCAM! Customer service is useless.,"Complete runaround! Everyone says that ""they are looking into"" the issue or that some other dept is handling it, yet nothing ever happens. Taking my money elsewhere. I have been arguing with them for over a week to offer their student discount."
"September 02, 2015",1,Worst service ever,I ordered parcel Saturday night paid for delivery to be on the Sunday!  Waited between 6-10pm no one showed contact customer care who said was a missed deliver I was home no one had showed and if they had why would a calling card not be left! Customer care confirmed be delivered Monday 31/8/15 again no show after 25 emails back and forth customer care said would never have been Monday as bank holiday so had been arranged for Tuesday waited again and no show have now been told parcel returned as unsuccessful delivery and I have to wait 7 days for refund is this really a away to run a business obviously don't care about customer service just making money! Will never use again!
"September 02, 2015",3,Average Experience.,"I've only ordered from ASOS once but purposely ordered from the 'petite' range as I'm quite small and thin. I find it hard to order clothes online and was very excited to see they had a special 'petite' section.  I ordered about 5 different things and they all looked very nice in the photos, all on petite sized models and it fit them really well, looked really fitted and flattering so I thought this was how it would look on me also. However this was wrong to assume because I couldn't believe how large each item was upon arrival, they looked so small in the photos but were baggy and large in real life! None of the clothes fit me properly, they were all extremely long (came down to my knees when they were supposed to be mid-thigh) and baggy around the waist. One dress was an off the shoulder style and looked very elegant in the photos but in real life it kept falling off my shoulders because it was just too big. I was very disappointed as it was a beautiful black dress with lace sleeves. It was the same problem with the rest of the clothes.  I also ordered a pair of black wide fit platform heels (only kind available was wide fit) and they were bigger than I thought. I have small feet and ordered UK size 3 / NZ size 5 as this is my usual size but they seemed more like UK size 4 in real life and are on the verge of looking weird on my small feet. They are also made of leather and the straps cut into my feet, they are very stiff and I've tried multiple times to loosen the leather but it never seems to work or make a difference. As a result the shoes are quite uncomfortable and hurt when I walk in them.  I gave ASOS 3/5 stars because the delivery was pretty quick and also free (unlike so many other online shopping websites) and I did quite like one dress, I've been wearing it even though it's quite baggy. Although I don't think I'll wear the rest of my purchases so I feel it was kind of a waste of money as I spent quite a lot for each item.  Not sure if I'll buy from ASOS again, I can understand it might be great for non petite people because the clothes will probably fit better. But would not recommend this website to any petite people, even buying from the 'petite' section like I did."
"August 30, 2015",2,"Not ""As Seen On Screen"" anymore","I have been an ASOS customer since 2009 or 2010. The latest orders have not been as shown on screen. The colors are not what's described and the returning process is so much effort that you don't feel like returning it  It's disappointing when you have been loyal customer for this long and that the product isn't what it' seems"
"August 30, 2015",1,SCAMMERS!!,"I have gone back & forth with these morons for over a month now via email since they don't have a phone number (sketchy already). They called me off a blocked number, promised me a refund (this is on August 8th). It's August 30th & they have yet to refund me TWO refunds now. Telling me it was processed so talk to my bank cuz it's not their fault. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!!! SCAMMERS!"
"August 30, 2015",5,I've always had great customer service from ASOS.,"Every time I've ordered from ASOS, I've always received my items quickly and with no hassle. On the one instance that I returned an item, I received an instant refund and they paid return postage costs. I didn't need to chase up for a refund. That's why I will continue to be a customer."
"August 29, 2015",1,sent me exact same faulty shoes twice!!!!,"I have been using Asos for the past 2 years, and have found their customer service to be poor whenever ivd had a problem with my order. My most recent experience is the worst I've ever encountered though! I ordered an expensive pair of shoes, they arrived on time but had 2 nails sticking up through the inside. I sent them back and requested an exchange, clearly writing what the fault was. It always takes a long time to get a new product sent out, but this time it was taking longer than normal and I had to send a chaser email. Funnily enough, after they emailed back the shoes were despatched. They gave an excuse that they had been busy. I noticed then that they had despatched to my home address despite my original order going to my parents. I emailed to explain I wouldn't be in and it was an issue. I ordered a new pair to my parents address and asked they cancel the other order. The replacement pair actually turned up on the Sunday but they had a large black stain on. I sent them back, and awaited the second order. When it arrived, I was disgusted to find they'd send me back out the pair with nails in again. I was furious. I have been in contact with them on Twitter and found them to be unprofessional and unhelpful. I've asked for it to be escalated as I'm not happy waiting 7 days for 2 refunds. They said they would pass to escalation team, and I've had to chase them twice about that already! I'm never using them again, they are a complete cowboy company!"
"August 29, 2015",1,Do not order international delivery.,"Customer service replies really fast; however, only to let you know that even you paid for an express delivery, the package will take longer than a ""saver"" delivery.Don't waste money on this website, they are jokers. Better knit it yourself.  PS. 15 days after order still not shipped (initial estimated delivery time: 3 working days)."
"August 28, 2015",1,DO NOT BUY,"I will strongly advice against this webshop. Have now tried for more than two months to get in contact with them in order to return items. They went completely radio silence and now I am stucked with 4 items (+500 EUR) I cannot use.  Worst EVER webshop experience - STAY AWAY"
"August 26, 2015",1,Awful Customer Service,"I ordered a suit for an upcoming trip that was scheduled to be delivered, according to ASOS, a few days prior to my trip.  When the package didn't arrive as promised, the customer service member responded with a too-bad-it'll-get-there-eventually attitude that I didn't appreciate.  At the end of the day, I understand that a company doesn't control how fast a package arrives once it is in transit, but they can be proactive before shipping to make sure that they choose a shipping option that ensures arrival by the promised date and if there are issues, they can issue an apology and a resolution."
"August 26, 2015",3,Simular,"I ordered three dresses from the brand ASOS.One dress was from asospetite and fitted me well (UK8), but a size smaller was maybe better. The other two dresses were the same but another color. I ordered UK8 and they were both to big. The red one was even bigger than the white one, even if I ordered the same sizes. The products were delivered the day after I ordered it.I'm 168cm and 49kg."
"August 24, 2015",1,Beyond a joke.,"I bought two items from them on the 16th of August and everything went smooth until Hermes claimed to have delivered my items on the 18th when they hadn't. I contacted ASOS to tell them that my parcel's tracking claimed that it was delivered to my porch when it hadn't despite two people being in the property at the time. I contact ASOS who said they would send out a replacement ASAP as both items were in stock. Three days later and there is no dispatch e-mail from the second order.  Queried this with their Customer Care Team on Twitter who tell me it won't be sent out until the 25th of August despite both items being in stock.  I asked ASOS to cancel this order and refund me. They told me they will request an order cancellation from the warehouse and will let me know.  6 hours later I received a dispatch e-mail.  I ask them why I received this and they told me that it can be a tight turn around and sometimes parcels are already picked before cancellation comes through. Fair enough, I thought, I will send back once I receive the items.  So I receive the items today... or item.  They had only sent me one item instead of two.  I ended up tweeting them again asking for details of their complaint procedure (still haven't received it). Ended up calling them on a number that they don't seem to advertise on their website but can find if googled. Explained the situation to Ricardo, who was very helpful and figured out what happened.  I will never use ASOS again.  I have placed 4 orders in the last 3 months and they've managed to screw up 3 out of 4. This one in particular was beyond a joke. I want to be able to buy from a retailer hassle free.  I would rather pay full price for a reliable retailer than ASOS."
"August 24, 2015",4,4 stars,"Free delivery, fast service, good package... The pictures are more glamorous that the real clothes."
"August 24, 2015",5,"Love shopping, love ASOS!",Great site! Love it ... but I love shopping too! LOL Probably why I'm single ... spend all my time in the shops hehe x Thanks ASOS! Any chance of a voucher discount???
"August 24, 2015",1,refund process stinks,i have been buying from asos for years and am a premier customer. in july i made a major purchase that came in 2 packages which i returned in july in 2 packages. i have been refunded for 1 package and i have been trying to get the refund for the other package for 7 weeks now.they keep telling me its been refunded and to wait 10 days then nothing. ..now they want bank statements..i have noticed other reviews with similar experiences.asos really bad customer service. .stop putting the onus on the customer. ..this is your problem. .you should fix it
"August 20, 2015",1,Wrong items,"Super upset with asos. They sent me completely wrong items and would not honor any discount for me to repurchase the same items. They said because it's sale items they can not give me any special discount. So not only do I have to waste my time (pregnant with a toddler) at the post office, I have to wait another week and a half to hopefully receive the correct items. I'm not sure if I want to purchase from this company anymore."
"August 20, 2015",4,pretty good,Great range for tall women. The only issues are with delivery.
"August 20, 2015",5,Asos curve,I have brought my clothes from there for years  .i thought I had better tell you what excellent clothing it is.there customer service is excellent  only one small problem there are no phones it's all done through email but that's answered rather rapid.but the service you get from them is excellent they deserve  more than 5 stars.if you have to send anything back at all there returns is excellent too. I'm very pleased with them so I hope you will be too and very up to date clothing.
"August 19, 2015",2,4 Weeks For A Refund!,"I am an ASOS premier customer and had ordered at the end of july, tried my things on to find they did not fir and sent them back using their prepaid sticker via Royal Mail. I had to prompt them that I hadn't received a confirmation of return after 8 working days (their policy states up to 7 working days) and so I sent them my proof of postage receipt.They said they would refund, but they hadn't actually received the goods back yet and to wait up to 5 working days for money to show in my account.Another week passed and still no sign of my money. Emailed again and they said there had been a ""glitch"" in their system and would retry the refund and to wait ANOTHER 5 working days.9 working days later i emailed AGAIN as the money had still not been refunded and they asked to see my bank statement to prove that the money had been taken out and not been put back in by them!!I have now been assured that the money has been refunded again and been told it may take up to 10 working days!!!This will be nearly 5 weeks of a no showing refund, please beware.Very polite staff though this doesn't resolve the issue."
"August 18, 2015",1,Faulty and wrong picks,"My first order from ASOS I found shoved through my letter box which my dog unfortunatly got a hold of and was useless, taking note of that I re ordered and left a note not to put through letter box but all of the items received where faulty! I thought it was just bad luck so 3rd times the charm i ordered and all the items i got where the wrong sizes! After these experiences I now just see them an as online Primark!"
"August 18, 2015",1,Treated me like a liar,"I ordered a present for my brother from ASOS which was never delivered.The courier (DPD) claimed to have a signature but, as I told ASOS, there was no one at the property at the time the signature was recorded, which I could provide evidence to support. After 2 full investigation and more than a month of battling they still refused to refund or replace the products!"
"August 17, 2015",5,good customer service,"i have bought a fair bit from ASOS over the years, recently i ordered a package which according to Aust Post was delivered , however i was at home when ""delivery"" supposedly occurred. So i contacted them and they told me they'd send a replacement free of charge, so i'm more than happy to keep buying from them."
"August 16, 2015",1,Delivery Service w/ Hermes,"I ordered a Barney's Originals Double Zip Biker Jacket in Bonded PU last week and it said estimate delivery would be 20th August 2015. However it arrived today the Hermes delivery guy was frustrated for waiting around for even one minute and left my item on the door which any passer-by can just take and it is my money down the drain. I am only writing my complaint on here as I could not find anything for hermes customer service."
"August 15, 2015",5,Great Customer service,"I ordered a suit and a pair of dress shoes from asos and they upgraded the delivery to International Express delivery. I received the order promptly within 3 working days. The shoes and the suit was great, I miscalculated the size of the suit so I ordered another one and sent this one back. I had no hassles, my new order again got an upgraded delivery. The order that I had sent back was received within a week's time and was refunded the same day. The new suit was great. The color of both the suits were accurate as displayed on the picture (not on the video). I will def use them again. Great customer service."
"August 14, 2015",4,Great selection,"Great selection, but some delivery costs are way to expansive and sometimes they don't even deliver it on time sooo..."
"August 13, 2015",2,terrible quality,bought a pair of shoes.. split apart from the tip in just 15 days. item returned and got refunded but not delivery charges. 4 quid out of pocket. will never buy from asos..
"August 12, 2015",1,Order sent to wrong address,"My order was sent to wrong address.Even though the courier said the package could be re-directed, Asos tried to make me believe that this wasn't possible.After 10 days emailing back and forth I gave up. Every time I get an answer it was always from a new customer service employee who hadn't read previous emails, and therefore it was from scratch every time.So in the end I have to spend 10£ and 3 hours of transport to pick up my parcel. So much for ""free shipping"" :)"
"August 12, 2015",5,Love it!,I really don't get why this site got so many bad reviews. I never had a single problema with asos. Their clothes are amazing and the delivery is fast. I love it!
"August 11, 2015",1,Horrible Customer service,"ASOS customer service is beyond horrible.  I recently purchased some school clothes from ASOS. I had recently moved so when I got to check out I updated my address. The next day I checked status on my package and saw that it was being shipped to my old address, I was very annoyed. I contacted ASOS by email because they don't have a call center and expressed my issue to them. Someone named Phil got back to me that same day and said that he would look into my issue and he asked me for my Order # and my address. The next day in the afternoon I noticed that Phil or anyone from ASOS customer service had still not contacted me back about the whereabouts of my package so I sent them a few emails back to back expressing my annoyance with this whole isse. Later on that day someone from there customer service name Sophie emailed back and said:Hello Yanni, Thanks for getting back in touch about the address change of your order ######## We're unable to amend the delivery address your order is being sent to. The parcel has been delivered to:#################################### This was delivered on the 11th August at 13:55 to the concierge.  You can try to retrieve the parcel from the current delivery address or ask the person at the address to return it to ASOS. If it's returned to us, a refund will then be issued and you'll receive an email to let you know. If you still want the items and they're still available, please order them through our website as normal as I'm unable to place your order for you, for security reasons. An easy way to do this is to log into your account, view the original order and then add the items you want back into your shopping bag. I'm sorry that this probably wasn't the answer that you was hoping for Yanni. If there's anything else tat you need,please get back in touch I'll be happy to help. Best wishes, SophieI was frustrated because basically they where like I had to pay even more money to get my package on a error they made or put my trust in some strangers hands hoping that they will do the right thing and send my package back I could not believe it. I then responded and asked to speak with a manager but I got no reply back they totally stop responding to my emails."
"August 10, 2015",5,Fantastic,"Great delivery time - delivered on both Saturday & Sunday (one of the items i wanted came back in stock the day after I had originally ordered). Customer service was brilliant through email, replied almost straight away. Thanks."
"August 10, 2015",1,Absolutely crappy customer service,"I'm a student who has made regular purchases for many years and have had a problem once where my order was not picked right and returned it TWICE to finally have it picked right and bearing in mind it was my prom dress so I was not happy about it not arriving on time. Yesterday, i've tried purchasing an order with my regular student discount code which both Asos and UNiDAYS provide and have used in the past but somehow it didn't work so I contacted both websites. Asos, low and behold, was RUBBISH at solving my query. They TOTALLY did NOT read my email properly and suggested I contact NUS out of all people to sort this out! They simply linked me to the NUS homepage, NOT help/ support page, and left me to my own devices. That was such an unexpectedly stupid thing for a big company such as Asos to do in terms of customer service to not even read my email properly! Will NOT be shopping at Asos anytime soon."
"August 08, 2015",1,Horrible site,most difficult site ever to try place a order!. Would not bother ordering again.
"August 08, 2015",5,I love ASOS,NIce range of clothes. Many different brands and they sell clothes from other high street retailers. Fast delivery. I have been using ASOS for years and cant fault them.
"August 08, 2015",5,Great,"I really don't get why this site got so many bad reviews.. I never had trouble with asos. It's easy and a lot of the stuff is cheap too... So yeah, I love it!"
"August 08, 2015",1,Worst CS team I've ever come across,"I love the variety Asos has. Especially for petites, which in other places is just hard to shop for. It really is a shame that their packing/shipping department and customer service teams are very inattentive. I was sent the wrong item after having it shipped express to have it on time for the weekend. I ordered a size 2 mini dress, and they sent me a size 6 long gown. Do they even read labels or check the item description before packing them?! Long story short, I didn't get to wear what I had planned to for a weekend event, and ended in a huge disappointment. Getting back to the customer service team, I know they couldn't careless if you were shipped the wrong item, or if it arrived late. Because it probably happens all the time! When I emailed service about getting the wrong item, they responded with an email completely irrelevant to my issue, which caused even more frustration. This tells me they don't actually read it. Asos really needs a one day or overnight shipping option for emergencies like these. If they did there would have been hopes to solving my problem. Asos, I love your product variety. But what's the point if your packing/shipping department and customer service teams are total disasters? Totally unhelpful."
"August 07, 2015",4,Lovely,loved everything I purchased recently!
"August 07, 2015",1,Pictures don't match the products,"I made two orders from Asos.co.uk and both times the product did not match the picture posted on the website. One was a lipstick, which they would not accept a return for because ""it had been opened"", even though the colour was clearly different from the picture (""we will advise our marketing team""), the second was a white lace dress which was entirely white on the website but turned out to have a brown front panel on the actual product! That was returned and refunded but was also the last time I will order from Asos."
"August 07, 2015",5,delivery,"I was meant to have an item delivered on a specific day chosen and paid extra for this. the couriers used as they used hermes and dpd both don't have my item and this was for a specific even which is why a selected date was chose for delivery.   however I called asos and the person I spoke to was extremely helpful. They informed me they would check and if the parcel could not be found they would refund the rest of my money as they will already refund my delivery and there is no more in my size. very happy with the service just a shame about the courier. I work I  a distribution centre and we use dpd and know what it can be like."
"August 06, 2015",1,Next day delivery...never delivered!,"Ordered from ASOS and was eligible for next day delivery. Due to the useless couriers Asos use, they kept trying to deliver a package during non-business hours to a busiess address even though i contacted Asos customer services twice to confirm it was a business address who assured me they would deliver during business hours the next day. Lo and behold, i sitll hadn't received the package today so followed up again to be told it was getting redelivered to their warehouse as they ""could not deliver it"" (note my work recception takes deliveries anytime of day between business hours - in fact an order from another retailer which I had ordered the same day as this Asos order had already been delivered successfully today). Asos said they would not be able to deliver my package (ever) so will have to refund me...but the great news is, is that i can re-order the same items IF the items are in stock! Thanks Asos...so kind. Not ordering from them again, not worth the frustration."
"August 06, 2015",5,Great service,"Orders are always on time. I live in the Netherlands and receive my orders always within three days. Great customer service. I bought heeled sandals and after 10 minutes of wearing both the heels clipped off. Being unable to walk I stumbled to a shoemaker across the street who fixed them. Sent Asos an email about a possible reimbursement and got a reply within an hour that they will reimburse the costs of the shoemaker. Only downside is the shipping by DHL, if I miss two delivery attempts I have to go to a DHL pick up point which is really far away!"
"August 05, 2015",5,Would recommend,"My go to website for all men's fashion items, a great range to choose from and easy to use website"
"August 04, 2015",4,Never had a problem with an order,"I have been shopping with ASOS for a few years now and I've never had a problem with an order. If they are not early, they are always on time. Free returns and free (international) delivery when spent £20 or more makes it even more attractive. However, I recently faced a problem with an ASOS Rewards codes after accumulating more than 500 points. Unfortunately, it took them almost two months and countless emails from me to sort it out. Overall, good company."
"August 04, 2015",5,Great service.,"Order delivered collect plus within 48 hours.Item of clothing didn't fit, got refund within 5 days. And a replacement item within 7 days. Couldn't complain one bit about the service. Free returns is great as well."
"August 04, 2015",5,Can't understand these bad reviews.,"Never had any problem with Asos at all, myself and girlfriend use them all the time and the delivery is always on time and the returns are dealt with quickly and efficiently. What more could you want?"
"August 01, 2015",1,bad quality :(,"on the picture seems like perfect but in the real its a bad quality :/ , i just wany to know where can i find the one on the picture i do like it in the picture , how ever it will be my last purchase in ASOS :/ , and its not cheap ://"
"July 31, 2015",4,Very good,"great service, delivery and products!!"
"July 31, 2015",5,COVERED UP SWIM SUITS,"Been looking for modest/covered up swimsuits everywhere! ASOS had so many to choose from and I bought two longsleeved suits and one dress one! I am a size 14/16 and even though it's swimwear it is not inappropriate or too tights, it fits perfectly and I feel so comfortable in them all! I didn't send any back!!! If anyone is looking to be covered up when they are away this summer, check out ASOS, you will not be dissapointed! Also very fast shipment!"
"July 31, 2015",5,Love it!,"I was really really surprised when I logged on here and saw so many negative reviews! I love ASOS and use it very regularly. I find that the quality of their goods, sizes and prices are all really great! I've been using ASOS for the last 3 years and have ordered a large number of items spanning over various categories and have never been disappointed. I'm really sorry to hear that that hasn't been the experience for everyone....it's a real shame."
"July 28, 2015",1,The worst costumer service I have experienced,"I bought a bathing suit and a skirt and payed for express delivery witch should be dispatched within 24 hours. After 5 days the order is still not dispatched and I want to cancel it since it is now irrelevant because I have left for three weeks on vacation. This is not possible and they dispatch it after 6 days though I have told them several times to cancel the order. Now I am home again and I have to pay the return myself though the fault is on asos.  Simply NEVER buying anything here again. They are just cheating costumers to get money."
"July 24, 2015",1,Not sure why there even is a CS team,"I made a simple order online (only one dress) and was highly anticipating its arrival. Upon opening the package, not only was I sent the wrong size, wrong color, etc, I was sent the completely wrong item.  Of course, I submitted a form online immediately and followed the instructions for return. Days and weeks past. I sent follow up emails to ask about my order. When I finally receive a response, the item I initially ordered was out of stock. Of course it was. It's been 3 weeks since!  The CS team gave me answers from the FAQ page. They offered ZERO solutions. I am also incredibly confused by the logistics team did not immediately pull the correct item off the shelf and ship it right away while it was still in stock.  As I am asking for a full refund, a CS team member has the AUDACITY to tell me that they will only refund the amount of the dress, and not cover shipping. Why would I pay ANY money for your mistake?  Again, no apologies or solutions were offered to me. The CS team at ASOS is a complete joke, and offering a FULL refund is the very least they can do.    With all the delay in communication and all the time wasted with ASOS, I will not be shopping with them again."
"July 23, 2015",3,Petite,"I'm 5 foot and always struggle to find nice jeans, a friend recomended asos and i noticed that while they have a large petite range of trousers all the models are 5""6 or taller. This information is in the product details. This puts me off buying anything from their petite range as none of the models showing the items are what i would call petite.such a shame asos get some shorter models please :( Jess King."
"July 23, 2015",5,Asos Customer service,"Honestly, I buy most of my trainers from ASOS because of their great customer service. They deliver on time or even early most of time. They RARELY make mistakes, and I love their sales. sneakerface.net"
"July 20, 2015",5,Asos saved the day :),"So I had ordered a chi chi london dress from the chi chi website for a wedding I was attending.  The dress came the day before the wedding and they had sent me the wrong size!!! :( I was devastated and started to seriously panic. Thank goodness I turned to Asos and they really did save the day. I was able to order the exact same dress for next day delivery.   I placed my order at 6.27pm on Friday and Asos delivered my dress at 9.07am on Saturday! :D  Amazing. I can't rate Asos highly enough, fantastic company."
"July 20, 2015",4,Great service!,"Great service! Delivery on time and you can even follow your parcel minute after minute!!Great customer service!Would highly recommend!"
"July 20, 2015",5,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!,"I have NEVER experienced a disappointment with asos, is actually a very good online store, and I love they have this small videos of models modeling the clothes before you buy it. I just love the website! FAVORITE ONLINE STORE *****"
"July 18, 2015",5,Completely Happy With My Order!,"I have recently received a pair of white leather PUMA sneakers that I ordered to wear with my scrubs in the OR. Ordering online was fast and easy, and I got an email confirming my order. I was surprised that the order arrived in a timely fashion because I chose standard shipping. When I received my order, I was impressed. The sneakers were finely made, with real leather; very sturdy and comfortable. I am totally satisfied and will definitely shop at ASOS again! Keep up the great work!"
"July 18, 2015",1,Their customer care is a complete joke!,"I orders am item on Monday with next day delivery and received both email and text communication from ASOS confirming it would be delivered on Tuesday. The DPD tracker said it never arrived with them and I emailed ASOS customer care on Wednesday afternoon to alert them to this.  Their first reply on Thursday morning just said the tracker says it isn't with DPD (funny I told you that). I replied later to ask if they had any further information and I got a reply from a different customer care assistant saying he would look into it - if I gave him 24hrs - my order was already 48hrs late by this stage. Confusingly I received a second email that evening that was a follow up to their original email (and completely ignored any email  I or indeed ASOS had sent since) saying it had been lost and a replacement would be sent. Fine! If only the story ended there - on Friday I got another email informing me it was lost and a replacement would be sent. Both emails that talked about a replacement said I would receive a dispatch email. Whilst waiting for this email, I received an entirely different one - informing me that my returned parcel had been received and a refund issued. Funny I didn't receive any parcel so would have been unable to return it! It seems that their customer care is a farce, I had emails from four different people who clearly had not looked at any other communication relating to this order. My final communication - four days after reporting non-delivery was to say we have refunded your money. A complete shambles - I wanted the replacement shipment not a refund but because multiple incompetencies by their so called 'customer care' team this option was removed from me. Add to this the fact that I had to find a phone number for them online as they don't have one on their website they only offer the multiple person, we will tell you anything and not follow it up email system."
"July 18, 2015",1,You had one job,"The only time I ordered something from Asos was a gift certificate for my best friend which basically required them minimum efforts from your side - send a picture with a promocode to an e-mail address on a particular day. On my friend's birthday I didn't congratulate her on purpose hoping that Asos will deliver my certificate and wishes on time..by the end of the day I felt something was wrong and wrote a friend whether she received it or not - she didn't of course. I wrote to Asos' customer support and they apologized, however needed two more reminders to send the certificate out IN 2 DAYS! Hopefully my friend understood the situation and was happy with a present. But Asos crashed my plans. You had one job, Asos. I paid basically for air - for a JPG picture to be sent to an email, but you are unable to deliver even this much for my own money. What can I say - my next friend will receive a certificate from another, more reliable shop. And I sincerely recommend anyone who doesn't want to endanger their plans / friendships to order gifts somewhere else."
"July 17, 2015",3,I want so badly for this to be a five star review,"I have ordered from Asos five times, so I consider myself to be knowledgeable enough to make this a sturdy review. I have to say, with five orders and one return I've never had any problems whatsoever with Asos customer service or shipping: all of my packages arrived exactly on time with no bumps in the road (and I live in the US, not the UK). So I'll make this simple:PROS:- Seriously unique styles available. ASOS really does carry styles I've never seen anywhere else, which is why they bring me back even after bad experiences. - Awesome prices, with a huge sale inventory. - Their website, shipping, and entire ordering process is really easy to navigate. They also send both receipt and shipping email alerts (which I appreciate). - When it's good, it's great! The clothes I've gotten from ASOS that have fit and were decent quality have uniformly been pieces I LOVE. - Returns are not only FREE, but also very seamless and forgiving. I have been known to keep stuff I was unhappy with merely to avoid the hassle of returning it, but ASOS really is good about refunding you and making it quick. CONS:- SIZING. This is my #1 complaint, and my reason for writing this review. I recently paid for an order that included two pairs of shoes and two pairs of shorts, with all the items being ASOS brand. The shoes, both of which I sized up in (I am a 9.5, often a 9, and I ordered 10's to be safe!) were too small. This was crazy, because I've never needed a size bigger than a 10 in my life. The shorts, which I ordered in my normal size, were WAY too big. In order of the clothes I have gotten, here has been my sizing experiences: dress (non-ASOS brand) – WAY too big, swimsuit bottoms (non-ASOS brand) – perfect, flat shoes (ASOS, and I should note these also were a size 10!) – perfect, crop top (ASOS) – perfect, shorts (non-ASOS) – WAY too big, which brings us to the order I already described above. I feel like I'm playing Russian Roulette with this company, even as I order everything in my regular sizes! Lord knows if I sized down to auto-correct, it would be just my luck that item would run small. I really think this could be remedied if the website had reviews, and it worries me that they don't.– As said above, there are no product reviews. What are they hiding?!– While ASOS brand stuff is reasonable quality for the price, the same does not go for all the brands they carry. Once, I was so profoundly disappointed by a Vero Moda dress I ordered that I nearly never bought from the website again. Of course, if you're familiar with a brand they carry and know how it fits you/the quality, etc, then go for it.– It really sucks when they carry styles exclusive to one of their petite, tall, or plus-sized brands that are not available for straight sizes! Often there's like a pair of petite brand shorts that I fall in love with, and ultimately have to ignore cause 5""4 does not qualify as petite :( In conclusion: I am ALWAYS hesitant about online shopping, and picky at that. ASOS keeps bringing me back because I'm so in love with the styles they carry and their service makes it all very easy. But they really need to get their sizing under control, or I'll have to force myself to stop shopping here because it is just disappointing. I really think they are capable of better."
"July 15, 2015",3,Non-delivery due to DHL postal (lack of) service,"UPDATE:I received a quick response from Asos to my complaint / cancellation of my order and apologies. Saying I will get a refund within 21 days and they wil look into the DHL post service matter.I've changed my review to a more positive one for Asos, but I'll wait with buying something again at Asos until they can offer some alternative delivery. - - -I've sent several emails to Asos and their postal service DHL about my doorbell not working and asking to change the delivery address. At the DHL site I found the option to have the package delivered to a parcel shop nearby. I filled it out and got confirmation.After that I did not hear anything for a while. I sent another email to DHL and they replied that something went wrong and the package was not delivered at the Parcel Shop. They also said that there would be another delivery attempt that day. Well, I'd say, after all the attempts I've made to communicate with both companies, just to deliver a simple pair of slippers... I find both their services sadly disappointing and inadequate. Just read the email correspondence and decide for yourself... For now, I will spend some more wasted hours on figuring out how to get my money back :( (15th juli, 2015 - Asos reply)Hello C.X., Thanks so much for getting in touch about your recent order 160816036 - So sorry that you haven't received your parcel yet. I've checked your order for you and can see that the carrier attempted to deliver your parcel onthe 4th July, 7th July and the 8th July but sadly no one was present to receive the order. As this is the case, your parcel was returned back to the warehouse on the 8th July. Parcels can be returned to us because the carrier has not been able to locate the address, has left a calling card and has not received a response or due to the parcel being refused at the delivery address. Please allow up to 21 working days from the date your parcel was sent back to us for it to arrive in our warehouse. As soon as it does, we'll get it sorted within 1 working day and send you an email to let you know. I'm really sorry your order didn't reach you. If you still want the items and they're still available, please order them through our website as normal as I'm unable to place your order for you, for security reasons. An easy way to do this is to log into your account, view the original order and then add the items you want back into your shopping bag. I hope this helps, if you have any further questions please let me know - I'm happy to help. Best wishes,JennyASOS Customer Care - - -(15th juli, 2015)Hi Saiful Ehshan, After several emails with your DHL post service, I still haven't received my package?Usually I get a card with information in my letterbox from the DHL, but there's nothing. It's been two weeks since the order has been dispatched.If I don't get any response from DHL or Asos within 14 days, I would like to receive my money back from my order - number 160816036.I'm dissatisfied with the DHL service and I hope you will start an inquiry in their services. It's not the first time this happens with DHL and I had hoped the 'Parcel shop' system would improve their services. Maybe it would be a solution if Asos provides an (alternative) option for delivery at a Parcel Shop or other Post office address in the order form? Below you can find the translated email correspondence with DHL post service. With kind regards,C.X.

"July 15, 2015",1,Terrible,"Did not receive my item and when I contacted them about it they gave me  a rude response as if it was my fault it got ""lost"" in the mail. I had to pay an extra duty fee when they sent out the replacement item. By the time i got it, it was too late. Also when returning, its not even prepaid. So i've spent more money on useless fees when I wont even wear the item. The worst experience from a company by far."
"July 14, 2015",5,Asos is #1,"I am very surprised by all of the bad reviews that are placed on this website about Asos. I Have truly not experienced anything bad with Asos, I have always received my items on time, and I order for me and my husband, and If  we ever had an issue customer service always replied in an instant. So I have luckily not experienced anything bad yet! I think Asos is the best clothing site out there it has everything you need with a wide price range. Therefore 5 stars! :)"
"July 14, 2015",1,Terrible customer service,"Have placed my first order and wish I'd realised how many people seem to have problems with lost deliveries and impossible to contact customer service. No parcel turned up (fine, these things happen and are to be expected if Hermes is the courier used). Tried emailing, twitter - no response. All I want is to get a refund for goods not received. Appalling non-existent customer service."
"July 14, 2015",5,Good seller!,"Now 1 st time order from Asos,good price,FREE speedy delivery!I will recommended this shop!"
"July 13, 2015",2,Poor customer service,"I had a problem with my order and contacted ASOS 4 days ago and have still not heard back. Meanwhile, ASOS continue to update their social media with endless irrelevant videos and jokes, rubbing salt into the wounds of unhappy customers. Used to love ASOS, but now they got so big they don't care about the customer anymore. Will not use again."
"July 13, 2015",5,Nice store,I bought a printing dress for wife ， it is beautiful and comfortable，my wife and her friends all like it.
"July 12, 2015",1,worst customer service ever!,"I recently ordered a belt off asos for an upcoming wedding, when the item arrived I opened it to find a completely different belt to the one I ordered, I contacted asos via facebook (as this is the only way to get some what of a quick response) and attached some pictures showing the item I ordered and what I actually received hoping to get some sort of a solution off them. The response is received was disgusting, a very sarcastic message detailing how the images were like a spot the difference game for a three year old, they did how ever say they would post out the item again. When the second item arrived it was again incorrect I can only assume this is down to an error on their behalf with the images they are using on their site, I once again contacted them via facebook with the only response being to send my items back for a refund. this exchange has left me rather angry as not once did they apologise for the rude response I received or did they offer a good will gesture for sending an incorrect item twice."
"July 12, 2015",5,Best site for online shopping,"My favourite website. Has clothes for all shapes and sizes. There is so much choice. You can end up browsing for hours. Sells clothes from asos and many other brands. Delivery is always on time or comes just before you expect. No problems with this site so far....touch wood. I'm sure it's the UK no1 site for young adults. Love it"
"July 10, 2015",5,ASOS is my go to online store!!!,"Just recieved 5 items from ASOS: a jacket, a sweater, 2 tee shirts and a backpack. All of them fit my size tremendously!!! The shipping was very quick to Canada and I appreciate everything! And I will be ordering more and more to come :)"
"July 10, 2015",5,Easy and convenient,"I placed quite a large order with Asos and once my order was processed I then decided to read some of the reviews, which obviously left me a little worried! However, I found the service I received was very easy and a smooth process. My order was dispatched as a next day delivery, in which I also got a text with a one hour window as to when my parcel will arrive which is incredibly handy! AND it actually was delivered within that hour!  I do have some bits I need to send back however it seems as though the process is just as simple. Couldn't be happier with my experience!"
"July 10, 2015",2,Professionally unethical behaviour,"I have been dealing with Asos for quite a while now, until recently I ordered a next day delivery.Well needless to say as I write this review I am still waiting and it was supposed to be delivered on July 04.I became very frustrated trying to contact them on line with no success, even the email which came to me saying that the order was confirmed, when I used it, came back as an unattended box.I then  tried calling only to discover that the call cost 75p per minute.Luckily I then discovered a 0207 number.I lost my cool. To think that they have a 0207 number and is  forcing customers to call a number charging 75p a minute is unethical and a disgrace to the people  who buy  from them.I am rethinking my relationship with ASOS because this is wrong on every level.BY THE WAY, THE NUMBER IS  0207 756 6100"
"July 09, 2015",1,"all (ok, some) style - no substance","Terrible, terrible customer service - some of the worst I've ever experienced from any company.  ASOS say that UK Mail lost my parcel, but they refuse to send a replacement order, and they are obviously stringing me along by continuing to insist that they are trying to obtain more information about what happened to my order. (It's been nearly two weeks now.) I get perky and repetitious emails from the company whenever I contact them, but absolutely no satisfaction. I have finally resorted to asking my credit card company for a refund - hate doing that, as none of this is their fault!  I will NEVER order from ASOS again."
"July 09, 2015",5,Excellent,"Hands down the best online retailer, ordered a fair few items and not a single problem, sent one item back as was too big but they text you when they have received it and again when the exchange has been dispatched... My only moan would be they should really have a few stores but no biggy."
"July 09, 2015",1,Bad experience,"Received worn item without tags and loads of stains! It is unbelievalbe that returned items are not checked, and again they are being posted to other customers!"
"July 08, 2015",4,"First Order, Not Bad At All","I ordered the Club L Plus Plunge Jersey Pencil Dress in pink product code 688880 (From the curve plus size women's section). I ordered the dress very late Tuesday evening June 6th and paid for 2 day shipping. I received notification via email the order would arrive on or before Thursday June 9th. I received the order Wednesday June 8th before noon. My order was literately processed and shipped in one day. I was nervous I needed the dress for a wedding I was attending that up coming Saturday July 11th while tracking the shipping I noticed it shipped from the UK so I was a little nervous. However the efficiency of the order processing shipping was not an issue. I opened the package pleasantly delighted to find the dress was exactly as advertised on the website. The dress was true to color. The material is of good quality.  I would have giving 5 stars however there were minor issues. Viewing the dress online on the model it was clear the dress would require alterations. Since most items I purchase require alterations that was a non issue for me. This is my first purchase from ASOS I wasn't sure if the sizes run true or if I could trust the size chart. I am 5'5 220 pounds. I have an hour glass figure.I have a bit of tummy overage, and about an inch of upper back fat. My measurements are 44-39-47 I wear a true size 16. I ordered a size 18. I received a size 22. I don't know if the incorrect size was an error or if ASOS was familiar with the product. Thank goodness I received the 22. The dress fits extremely close to the body. It literally hugs the body like a glove. But it feels good on. It is very important wear the proper undergarments and body shaper with this particular dress because it will reveal every secret you have. So in the case of this dress a size 16 or 18 would have been to small. The sleeves of the dress gathered a bit to much for me and they were to long (which could be seen on the model as well) so they had to be altered to tapper my arms better. However I like the extra space because my arms are a bit large.  All in all I am very pleased with the dress and the processing of my order. I apologize if I gave to much personal information but I look for detailed descriptions when reading a review."
"July 08, 2015",5,Cheap and cheerful.,"Others may have had problems with ASOS, but...I've bought over 20 items of clothing (trousers, waistcoats, tracksuits) from  ASOS and never had a problem. From my experience, ASOS products are great value for money. The next-day-delivery service, ""premier"", is cheap (£9.95 for a year, compared to Amazon Prime at £79). Service for me has always been great. Returns and exchanges have been seamless. Honestly, I can't fault them."
"July 05, 2015",5,Best online clothes shop,"I have been an asos customer for a while now but i decided to take up the 9.95 offer for 1year premier membership, its the best thing indid, next day delivery on every order, nominated delivery if need to aswell, bargain, the clothes are always good quality, never recieved bad quality, i will use Asos for my clothes shopping for many years to come :-)"
"July 03, 2015",5,Aldrig haft et problem (Never had a problem),"Jeg har været kunde hos asos i ca. 3 år, og køber stort set alt mit tøj fra asos. Vil tro jeg kun har købt tøj fra andre steder end asos 4-6 gange de sidste 2 år, og jeg køber tøj ca. 3 gange om måneden.  Man får hvad man ser, og min ordre er aldrig kommet senere, end den seneste frist de angiver i ordresbekræftelsen. Udover det er det jo alt for lækkert, at der er gratis forsendelse. Måske er jeg bare virkelig heldig, men fra andre jeg kender, der også shopper på asos, har der heller aldrig været nogen problemer. Jeg har en enkelt gang skulle returnere en kjole, og der var heller ingen problemer. Jeg har aldrig skulle skrive ind til deres kunde service, så på det plan har jeg desværre ingen ekspertise. ELSKER ASOS <3 (English translation)I've been a customer at asos for approx. 3 years now and get most of my clothes from their site. I believe I've only bought clothes 4-6 times from other webshops/stores than asos within the past 2 years. - I buy clothes approx. 3 times pr. month.  You receive what you expect, and I've never experienced receiving an order later than the date that has been informed in the order confirmation. Besides that, it's just a luxury that they provide free international delivery (Excuse me if this doesn't include all countries, I havn't read their international shipping policy). Maybe I'm just really lucky with my service, but friends and acquaintances of mine, who also shops at asos, hasn't had any difficulties either. I had to return a dress to asos once and once again I didn't have any difficulties. I have never had the need to write an email to their costumer service, so unfortunately I don't have any expertise in that area. LOVE ASOS <3"
"July 03, 2015",4,"Fast delivery, accessories for every taste!","I ordered a Batiste Dry Shampoo, 3 Nail polishes and 1 lipstick. Fast delivery, no problem at all. I was able to track my order all the way, and there was no need to contact Asos at all, so I don't know how the service is. I like how there is free shipping, if you buy more than 125 DKK, which isn't a lot of money! I don't really like their clothes, but their accessories are on point. One for every taste. Their clothes are not for every taste though. Maybe too floral, printed, basic or just too simple to the price.  Delivered to Denmark and my package came within 3 work days."
"July 03, 2015",5,Outstanding and reliable!,I've been using this website for a few years now to buy clothes. It is fantastic! If there are any missing orders (maybe 2 out of the 100 orders I've had with them) then their customer service will just mail you a replacement order. Definitely 5 stars for customer service!
"July 01, 2015",5,I'm Impressed,"I purchased a Trench Coat from Asos. (The delivery was very prompt considering it was free.)Looks great and fits perfectly. I think this is one of the best clothing sites online (even better in the sales)I sent the customer care team an email to let them know this. I received an email back-( same day). The email received back was very nice and thoughtful-which is great customer service. I've ordered a few things from Asos -no problems. Thumbs up  :)"

"July 01, 2015",2,Not impressed,Ordered some shirts and paid for the premium service so I could get next day delivery. That was 4 days ago and still no sign.
"June 29, 2015",1,costumer service is very rude,"1)They don't help or even offer advice, 2) their refund system is awful 5-10 working days really,the costumer service people all sound like robots, quoting the website with every questions."
"June 27, 2015",1,RUBBISH CUSTOMER SERVICE!!,"Ordered a dress but was out when it was delivered. Courier put a card through my door to say 2 parcels (other one was from Simply Be) had been left in my recycling box. This can't be seen from the street so clearly someone was following the courier around because when I got home 2 hours later there was nothing in the box. Contacted the 2 companies immediately. Simply Be responded and straight away and replaced the goods. Three weeks later I have not had a single response from ASOS other than an automated reply to say that they are looking into the problem and will get back to me! I won't be ordering from ASOS again!!"
"June 27, 2015",1,Awful,"I received two faulty products, one ripped and one stained (which meant they had simply replaced a t-shirt that someone else had worn and gave it to me). I was fine exchanging the wripped one, but wished to keep the stained one because they had no more available and I really liked the top. All I wanted, which was completely reasonable and any other store would have instantly done, was a small discount on the price of the dirty t-shirt they sent me - they refused! They would only refund - which I already stated to them I would rather not do. They offer me a 15% discount on a future buy but because I already have student discount that was 10% and I can't use both codes together, this meant that it was only really a 5% discount which had an expiration date of merely 1 mounth, which I wouldn't use in such a short period of time because I already did my big summer shop. I asked them to increase the percatage by a little (after all I am always spending a lot of money there) - NO.I asked to at least extent the expiry date of the discount so I would actually be able to use it when I needed something - NO.So all in all, the only thing they offered me was something which would mean I spent more money at their store which benefited than way more than it did me. Why giving a small percentage off for a faulty product - which any else would do - is so hard, is beyond me.  If I can't trust them to be reasonable and be held to the same standard as other stores - why would I spend a good £400-£500 a year there?Rediculous and a shame because they have lost a very loyal customer!"
"June 27, 2015",1,Never Again!,"Placed an order and got an email confirming that the order was received. Then got another email stating that the order has dispatched. Two days later yet another email, this time thanking me for returning the item. Obviously I never even received the package. Then when I contacted them they were very polite and said that they'll send me the item if it still is available. Now got an email saying that it's out of stock. The product is still for sale on their web page and can be ordered. Seems like a SCAM to me."
"June 23, 2015",5,Excellent,Ordered handbags at 3pm Monday and i received it at 9am the following morning! Very impressed. Would definitely shop again!
"June 23, 2015",1,WORST online shopping experience ever!,I ordered six items. Received email saying they had canceled my order and I needed to send passport and bank statements to verify payment for future orders. I did so but email bounced. In the meantime only two items I ordered were still available. Re-ordered but received same email saying to send passport and bank statements. A complete waste of time.
"June 22, 2015",2,"wrong item, not in stock anymore","Ordered from them for my first time and got lucky to order a shirt that was low in stock and that I was very excited to get my hands on.... And of course, they sent me the wrong item. And not only that, but it's not in stock anymore. The package had the right label on it but with the wrong shirt inside.  Perfect. Not shopping with them anymore."
"June 20, 2015",4,Not a problem thus far,"I've ordered a few times from ASOS, all spread throughout 2013-2015 and not had any major problems with my orders. My recent order was expected to come around Wednesday but arrived on the Saturday before hand (which if I had specified for a Saturday delivery I would have had to pay around £5) so if you're in the UK, you may as well go for Standard delivery and it may come much earlier like mine. I have noticed that some heels I bought had a blemish on them that I can't remove, but I can't be bothered with the hassle of returning so that doesn't seem much of an issue. Also, I wish they would not fold dresses when packing them as it gives them creases which is annoying if the dress is expensive. However, these issues are just me being critical and I think that the store itself is fine. Overall, the delivery was great, the clothing is usually in perfect condition and I'm left as a happy customer."
"June 20, 2015",1,ASOS- worst customer service I have ever experience,"I order some clothes online and got it sent to my UK address on screen the I saw the confirmed for my UK address  and said that i could expect deliver by June 18 but then an email came thought to me saying the clothes were being sent to a old Canadian address I use to live at and I could expect deliver by June 24th.....I don't live in Canada anymore or know who lives there and ""the best they can do"" is tell me to try and figure out who lives their and get them to return the package......how the hell was my UK credit card charged when they screwed up the delivery and billing address. I can't believe they didn't offer me a refund right away and apologise for their mistake I always enjoyed shopping at ASOS but I have never in my life received such horrible customer service. I am beyond frustrated with ASOS, I have emailed them through there website - absolutly useless...all the replies I got were template message and not personalise so I tried there Facebook page and started messaging them through that and each time it's a different agent who responses to my message and doesn't read the ones before them and just says sorry the deliver address can not be changed...if they can't change the delivery address they need to refund me for their mistake....I am outraged.  I would suggest everyone to save themselves this hassle and to never order from ASOS."
"June 19, 2015",5,ASOS is the best!,"I've been ordering from ASOS for atleast 7 years and have always thought their customer services department is amazing. Yes they do sometimes make mistakes, but they rectify them immediately and are extremely friendly and reply promptly by e-mail. 100% recommended by me (for UK only) and I trust them more than any other online site. I'm actually so shocked with the bad reviews as I've always had a positive experience."
"June 17, 2015",1,Used to be excellent - now abysmal.,"In the last 6 months every time I have ordered from ASOS I have had nothing but hassle.  Most recently I had problems trying to order during a 20% off promo and their customer service team kept asking me to use their website when I had told them their website was crashing repeatedly.  After 6 hours I managed to place my order but when I received it, it came in a box with no protection with a glass bottle of foundation rolling around inside.  Most recently I ordered again during another 20% off promo, I didn't learn the first time apparently, as I tried to pay it said the order failed, however checked paypal who said it had gone through.  I had no reply from Customer Service for two days and I had to chase them up repeatedly. Finally got an e-mail response who said it would take another 48 hours - may I add this was a birthday gift I had ordered on the 15th for the 23rd.  I found their phone number which they don't advertise on their site.  I spoke to a very pushy customer agent who confirmed my order had been cancelled and I would not be receiving it.  I told them it was a birthday gift, I needed it and they were holding my money.  She wouldn't budge, told me that the order was cancelled and that was it.  I asked if they would provide me with a discount code so I could reorder at the price I paid on Monday, she said no.  Not only are they holding my money, they aren't taking my order and they have left me now to go out and try and find another gift.  Not only that, I have to contact Paypal myself to sort out the money being held even though ASOS are the ones holding it!  An absolutely ludicrous way to treat customers. I had a previous discussion before where I stated I thought ASOS had become a shadow of their former self.  This has been very much confirmed and to be honest I will not be shopping with them again.  I can get most of their merchandise for other sites and shops and I wouldn't want to give them my money."
"June 17, 2015",3,Don't trust delivery times,Great products but horrible US delivery. Their quoted delivery dates are not accurate! If you plan to order something expedited... Don't expect it to be delivered when you expect!  This has happened to me many times!
"June 16, 2015",5,I just love Asos!,I just love everything about this shop! And it has one of the best delivery services!! I ordered a parcel at 9 pm via next day delivery and it was really delivered before 1 pm the next day! Thank you guys!!
"June 16, 2015",5,I loooove ASOS,"I have been ordering from Asos for over 4 years. I order at least 2-4 items a month, if not more. Their customer service has always been 5 star for me. My items are ALWAYS shipped in 2 days and the returns are ALWAYS hassle free.  My refunds are always credited back to my accounts. I'm a avid online shopper and Asos is in my top 5 for highest rated online customer service and quality of apparel."
"June 15, 2015",1,Still Waiting for my Item,"It has been such a bad experience and sill is as I m still waiting for my item to be deliver.For some reason my item was send to my billing address  when I did asked to be send to my work address, I receive the package at my home after receive a confirmation mail saying that it will be deliver to my work address.I did send it back as it was the wrong size, I then confirm that I needed it to be send to my work address witch of course hasn't.Last Saturday my partner was at home all day and I was I work all day, was expecting one of the 2 adresses to get delivered.I receive a mail saying that they tried to deliver to my home address (still don't understand why !!! ) but no one came.Got in touche with some guys from asos who guarantee they will deliver to my work address again on Monday. (today ) Still nothing and no news from Asos -Very unhappy prob the last time that I order with them if I don't receive my item.They should make sure that their client receive what they pay for.Not the case ..."
"June 14, 2015",4,good for clothes shopping,been using for both mine & my daughters clothes since Christmas and fond them to be efficient. Need more sales though ;)
"June 13, 2015",5,Only praise from me,"Placed my order for multiple items on Friday morning.  Qualified for free next day delivery.  Was pleased to see that asos use dpd so had an hour slot where I could live track parcels. Saturday lunchtime my items are with me and I'm very pleased with the clothing, service and delivery.  Really impressive over all and will get my business again."
"June 13, 2015",1,terriable delivery and customer service !!!,They have awful delivery service I've had many problems. I wanted my delivery for next day and they did not deliver. In addition  they have put it through at standard delivery. My friend had the same problem they delivered her order after 2 months!! Never ordering from asos again!
"June 12, 2015",3,"Good, but troubles with delivery","I would defiently shop at ASOS again, it's easy to use the site and have a lot of lovely things, and cheap too! I bought a bag, it's super easy, big plus, BUT the delivery took a bit longer than expected and I missed a good track and trace service."
"June 12, 2015",1,Horrific Customer Service,"Received my order on time. Unfortunately an item was missing. Not only did they not resend out the missing order, their customer care team was rude and declared my account was no longer active and would not be doing anything in terms of a refund or replacement. Unbelievable how a company of this size can treat a customer like this."
"June 11, 2015",3,Used many times but let down on the last few orders,I've always used ASOS to shop ever since they first started and have always rated them for their quick delivery. I've placed a number of orders over the last week for dresses to wear to weddings over the summer. Disappointingly on two occasions i have received my parcels with the dresses screwed up in the bag. These have been satin £80+ dresses arriving in a really poor creased state. The latest order was an £80 Warehouse dress which had clearly been worn as there were drink stains down the front and it smelt like someone has sweated in it all day - not what you want to receive when ordering especially items at this price !
"June 11, 2015",1,Untrustworthy unreliable and indifferent,"I bought a dress from ASOS on May 25th and they told me that it would be with me by June 8th. Mind you that June 8th was their closing date. I needed the dress for an event on June 10th, so I was pretty confident that I would be OK and ready to go.Now that I am writing this, it is the 11th of June,still no dress and their customer services are useless.I sent them a series of complaints and their steady answer is ""Sorry, these things happen, wait another week, go to your postal office and if all else fails,talk to us in a week"".Absolutely disappointing and useless service.Never buying from them again."
"June 11, 2015",5,Good custumer service,"Recently my sunglasses broke, then i wrote to Asos about it and they send me a new pair the day afterReally good custumer service"
"June 10, 2015",5,AMAZING,"Always very accurate, fast and never had any problems. I am a premier member and its worth it :)!"
"June 10, 2015",1,Do not by from ASOS worst company ever,"Still havnt received my shoes or had a refund, whatever you do don't leave a message with the receptionist NATALIE to try and sort out there mistakes which let me tell you there are plenty of. When you leave a message with her it never reaches were it is suppose to, made millions of phone calls which get you nowhere except an expensive phone bill. And emails do not get replied to no matter how many you send. Here's a list of the so called customer care team who you don't want to deal with, JAMES, HUGO, NATALIE, WORST (receptionist) EVER,  PHILIPPE  the manager who hasn't got a clue what's going, all he does is pass the blame on to someone else, well done PHILIPPE take a bow. CARRIE ANNE customer experience team, she needs to look up the word in a dictionary because she obviously does not no the meaning of the word. Take my advice and save yourself a lot of hassle from this absolute joke of a company and DO NOT BY FROM THEM."
"June 09, 2015",4,Very happy with asos service,"I got my parcel,perfect service as usual,i recommed asos"
"June 07, 2015",4,Great Shopping Experience,I am a regular ASOS shopper and have been for years now. They stock a great selection and provide free deliveries and returns. The only problem I have ever had is that deliveries do not always arrive on time but customer support are always quick to respond to and solve any problem or queries.
"June 05, 2015",2,Ummmm ?,"Well the site is really expensive so i ordered some makeup ..The shades of the concealer and foundation weren't as expected . no promo codes that sucks.packaging was cute though."
"June 05, 2015",5,LOVE them,"i'm always ordering from ASOS!! probably my favourite online store and even when i find other products from river island, new look etc. i always check if ASOS have them in stock as i prefer the service from them! amazing with delivery, offers and refunds with every order. will always be a customer :)!"
"June 04, 2015",1,The Incompetence is staggering,"The extent of this company's incompetence is appalling. I ordered a 3 pack of t-shirts and a pair of shoes. The shoes are 2 RIGHT FEET. Not only that, One is a size 9 and the other is a size 9.5! NOT ONLY THAT, I ORDER A SIZE 10.5! NOT ONLY THAT, THEY SENT THE WRONG SHOE! That's 5 mistakes on one item.THERE WERE NO SHIRTS IN THE PACKAGE EITHER! They immediately refunded my order when I got them on the phone, which was nice. But I asked customer service if they could offer me free shipping to keep me as a customer and I would gladly replace the order. And they said NO! Not even to rectify their own incompetence. Now I have to waste time shipping their mistakes back to them."
"June 04, 2015",1,My order was sent back without notice,"I was waiting for my parcel and just when I thought that it was taking a very long time, I received an email that it is returned to ASOS, without notice? I contacted the CS and they gave me a standard answer: DHL couldn't reach you so they sent it back and please check your spam. Well, the address given is an international company and when I checked the status it says: delivered in Germany, but my address is in The Netherlands. So this is clearly a fault of the shipping company: they never contacted me, I checked my email. I don't like to fact that CS clearly didn't check the tracking info and just gave me a standard answer, basically saying: it is your own fault... So when I still want the product I can order again if it is still available... Well, no, thank you : what a bad service, never again."
"June 03, 2015",3,Next day delivery!,"Whenever I have dealt with the customer service team they are great and I do enjoy shopping with Asos. However I placed an order the other day and spent over £100, I opted for free next day delivery. Unfortunately I didn't receive the next day service because I didn't type in next day in capitals in the promo part. I do not think the instructions are very clear and because of this I won't be getting my items in time for an occasion. This is something that needs to be improved so the next person doesn't make the same mistake."
"June 02, 2015",5,Excellent!,Love Asos. Always deliver on time!
"June 02, 2015",5,Har aldrig handlet med en virksomhed med så god service!,Super service !!
"June 02, 2015",5,I love Asos!,"I always enjoy shopping at Asos. Things are pretty cheap and the service is good. Even though I live in Denmark, I receive my orders rather quick. I have nothing to complain about."
"June 02, 2015",1,Disgusting company!,"I could not get through to the site on the day of the promotion as their site had crashed and they would not give me a code for the next day. Absolutely disgusted and I will never use them again."
"June 02, 2015",1,Usually great service turns into conning it's own premier customers.,"Usually love ASOS and I'm subscribed to Premier.However their most recent discount code which took 20% off everything, I tried to order 2 items, I was repeating the process on all devices from 6pm up until midnight before giving up and going to bed. I managed to place an order on 1 of the items the following day, and the code was valid however my second item magically appeared out of stock. I checked back to purchase later as I had an email to say it was back in stock the code has now expired, (this is a matter of 2 hours) so they obviously haven't received a brand new delivery and updated stock, it was taken out to avoid the code. I got in touch with ASOS asking for them to add this to my order, or give me another code, but they refused, and said 'CONGRATULATIONS YOU MANAGED TO USE YOUR 20% CODE ON YOUR 1st ITEM.' This just seemed like rubbing it in, the worst possible way. Very disappointed as they completely ignored my problem and decided to gloat about it."
"June 01, 2015",5,"Good offers, always quickly delivered, simple returns","I've used ASOS quite a few times now and so far have always had a good experience with them.  As you'd expected ordering clothes online a few items don't fit or suit you but returning and getting refunds is always easy and works.  I usually select the free delivery option but still seem to get very quick delivery.I was surprised to see some poor reviews on here so it's a shame others have had problems.  However my own experience of ordering and returning, all using the online system (not needed to, or tried to contact by phone) has been great.They also email me with lots of offers which is good, as not too spammy and I like their selection of clothes."
"June 01, 2015",1,Really bad costumer service,"Yesterday you had a promo code ""sadly"" your site was down all day/night.. I didn't get thru to the site and lost the opportunity to buy. I dont believe this is a coincidence.. Why can you guys not extend the 20% off?Hope you are realising what this do to your costumers. This is ridiculous!"
"May 31, 2015",4,satisfied,"1.a big range of clothing2.nice prices3.polite customer service4.when i had a problem with my order i found a solution(refund my money the first time and resent me my order another time)5.sometimes it is too late to deliver the products6.i did not like the fact that now i have to pay for shipping costs under 30e.(Before it was free)"
"May 30, 2015",2,Poor,I bought a 3 piece suit from asos and a hip flask. The suit was stated as been navy and in pictures it was but when it arrived it was black. This same delivery had rust on the hip flask and the trousers where missing. I did notify asos about the missing trousers they replied within the hour to let me know they have sent my missing item through the post. Then 2 days after I had an email to say they are out of stock. This was my first time buying from asos and probably the last.
"May 29, 2015",1,Worst,Worst place to shop online. Never deliver on time even though they charge you.
"May 29, 2015",1,Worst Customer service.,"So...I have a premium membership for asos in US. I bought often on a short period of time..as I landed here with one small suitcase. Unfortunately they became worst every day...wrong size item delivered, custom service incapable of understanding my problem. Be aware of the refunds: I bought a few items in total of over 150 USD. They had a promo code at that time that offer me a 30 USD discount. Great I was thinking. Well one of the items (a 34 USD shirt) was bad and didn't fit me. I RETURNED IT hoping for a refund. Guess what: they refund me only 4 USD as in their opinion the discount is taken out when it comes to refund ( the whole discount, even if I returned just one item) So I ended up paying the whole amount of money (- 4 USD) and one item less. Now that is business. I asked them to return the item at least as I could offer it as gift to someone. Their response: my issue has been adressed and canceled and if I want to discuss it again, I can do it in 14 days...Like start over etc."
"May 29, 2015",5,Great shipping experience,"On Sunday night I ordered a pair of shoes to be shipped here in New Zealand and I received them on Friday morning which is what I was hoping for but not expecting! Great price. Cheaper than I can get in stores here, even with shipping."
"May 28, 2015",2,Meh.,"Loved asos at first back when they had free shipping no limits. over time they have just gotten worse. At first i noticed they slowly raised the shipping cost ''spend $40 for free shipping"". And their price promise is ridiculous considering they only price promise UK sites and over price things that are non-uk so you cant get a price match.. now after emailing customer service so much, i have only noticed they seem so clueless and act stupid. Oh and their shipping speed is terribly slow, i have been waiting 4 weeks for a simple dress only to find out they ''lost'' it.  way to go asos."
"May 28, 2015",1,There is no customer service,"I have sent 5 emails through the website and 2 from my email as a ""reply"" to the confirmation because I didn't know what else \to do. Have never heard back. They are awful."
"May 27, 2015",4,Pleasing,Delivery was good & clothes even better :)
"May 27, 2015",5,So happy with service and sweater,I ordered a Wildfox sweater and was worried after reading bad reviews of this company. I got an email saying my item shipped the same day I ordered it. It had a link to check tracking info. My item arrived in 3 business days instead of the 4 days I paid only $6 for shipping. I am so happy with my experience and my sweater was perfect!
"May 26, 2015",1,Awful business,"Ordered one simple pair of sunglasses over three weeks ago and took a week to even get processed and shipped out.  Received shipment email and with a tracking #, except to even track shipment(which isn't working) you have to sign in every time.  It's almost been two more weeks and I have yet to receive them."
"May 25, 2015",3,Getting worse,"I used to buy from asos very often, although they seem to be becoming progressively worse. I've had to return 4 items due to them being the wrong item/size or damaged on arrival. Customer service is non existent - they just send the same standardised email. The returns process is a nightmare. I find myself constantly sending emails to remind them that my items have reached their returns facility. A while ago the refunds were processed in around 3-5 days, although now it takes around 1-2 weeks!  I'll give them 3 stars as sometimes you can find good bargains and the delivery is very fast."
"May 25, 2015",5,Love ASOS!!,"I love asos and have been shopping here a while, I have a premium account which means I pay just £10 a year for free next day delivery whenever I want it and sometimes even get an email saying I can shop  the sale 24 hours before everyone else :)!! Delivery is fab! It's always on time and returns are so simple and free! Excellent website! Always the first I look on when I need something"
"May 22, 2015",5,Great,"Delivery is prompt and efficent, quality is good, website full of inspiration - excellent all round."
"May 19, 2015",5,Pleasantly surprised,"I was searching the web to find a pair of sandals and found a website that advertised numerous companies. I found some I liked and placed an order for 2 pair. I never heard of the website ASOS so I searched for a review and was concerned about the rating. I know, I should have done this first. I tried to cancel but it was too late. I watched my emails and had regular statues updates of my shipment and received my order within 7 days. Unfortunately when they came the sandals were too small so I ordered 2 more in the right size and mailed the other ones back. I thought that it would take forever to get the refund but I was refunded in 12 days. I also received my second order within 6 days no problem. I love the sandals and have not found any like them sold anywhere else. This was a pleasant surprise considering all the bad reviews I read from other customers."
"May 19, 2015",2,"Poor customer service, item tagged incorrectly so wrong size but no refund",I ordered a size 6 dress. I received a dress with tags hanging off it which said 6. I had tried this dress on elsewhere so knew it would fit. I only bought from asks because it was cheaper. When I got on holiday and put my nice new evening dress on it was horribly baggy. I rechecked the tag which said 6 and so as I had no other dress wore it. Later when I was packing I checked the wash instruction label which said size 8. The dress was tagged incorrectly which is their mistake. Their customer services were unapologetic and said I should have checked all the tags and labels. I think this is rubbish customer service as who in all honestly checks the price tag with the size on  AND the wash instructions label inside the bottom of a dress when they buy it?
"May 19, 2015",3,Wrong Item,"I am normally quite happy with the service. However, this time I have ordered a shirt that i really needed for this week. Guess what?? I have opened a parcel and instead of a blue shirt there was a black summer dress. Really upset. Not happy when you rely on service and then they let you down. Posted it back and asked for refund as I don't need this shirt anymore. ADVICE- Whoever pack orders please double check that you pack a correct item"
"May 18, 2015",1,customer service?,"Absolutely the worst online customer service! ASOS  placed  the wrong address on my package, making it undeliverable. Now I will  not have my items for an event or even a refund for 10+ days (event is in 14 days) don't waste your time or money with this site."
"May 16, 2015",1,A Poor Experience Spread Over the Period of a Week,"I've had an awful experience with ASOS over the period of the past week. Repeatedly, I have been requested to reexplain my problem; repeatedly, my explanations of the problem have been ignored.  Situation is this: ASOS failed to deliver an ordered product by the date they said that it would arrive. ASOS then failed to understand that I had moved following that date and insisted that I continue waiting to see if the package would arrive (just to reiterate, I no longer lived at the address). As of today, they still are requesting for me to check around the premises of the address in the city in which I no longer live. Wherever ASOS'S customer service takes place, either the people are poor at performing their work (I've dealt with multiples) or the policies they have in place are meant for money saving rather than customer satisfaction. I will no longer shop with this company and am awaiting a return of my funds. I will also make this purchase elsewhere."
"May 15, 2015",5,caring and warm,"I'm 17 weeks pregnant and pushed my luck buying a beautiful summer dress (not maternity) it was literally a little tight for my relaxing comfort and arranged to return. Wondering about refunds I sent an email only to find one back within minutes by a girl called Jessica, she couldn't have spoken any better congratulating me on my baby and wishing me well and a great weekend. From a stranger I have never spoken to someone so thoughtful. I closed my email with a huge smile on my face, thankyou Jessica :) *****"
"May 15, 2015",1,Terrible customer service,"Out of all the online stores I've shopped at this has definatley got to be the worst for customer service. After several times using ASOS, i have the same bad experience. -If you try to call in; DON'T, it will take you 30mins till someone answers the phone because their customer service line is in SPAIN!!!-They fail to deliver on time/day.   - If you need something for a certain day, don't bother with ASOS, they will not make that happen. A message for ASOS; you need a UK Based Customer service line, better service and better shipping agreements. Sincerely, annoyed customer."
"May 15, 2015",5,Love love love,"I use ASOS all the time, in fact that is my main shop for clothing now. I return my fair share as well and it has the best return service of any online retailer."
"May 15, 2015",5,"I Love this company, have been a customer for 3+ years!","I absolutely love this clothing company, best customer service, fast shipping, I don't order clothes anywhere else!! one of my favourite online stores ever! Never had a problem always happy with my orders. Thank you so much for the best service. :)  Nora Beha"
"May 15, 2015",5,Consistent in service although quality of own-brand can vary,"free delivery and returns, amazing selection, happy to keep using them"
"May 14, 2015",1,Not even worth one star,I have my baby shower next weekend . I finally found a dress I liked on asos. I needed express so I clicked express then received email stating won't be delivered until after my baby shower so I had 30 min to cancel. I canceled and then says takes 10 days for money back in account. I can't re order without those funds. They wouldn't add express shipping on my order or let me reorder without paying again for another dress . Which I can't do or I'm desperate enough I might have. Now I'm totally screwed. They don't tell you they don't refund you right away and even if you clicked express it doesn't always work. Don't order from them
"May 14, 2015",5,Absolutely Amazing,"This company is fast, efficient and easy to order from.  The selection is excellent and if you are not happy with your order for any reason, the customer service team is extremely helpful.  Refunds are processed on or even sometimes before the stated date.  All in all AMAZING. Lisa"
"May 13, 2015",5,Brilliant!,"Easy to order (best app shopping I have found yet).Very helpful staff, when I needed to return, the return was quick and easy and processed quickly. Great quality products!"
"May 11, 2015",5,Favorite fashion website,"I love asos - good inspiration, delivery and returning."
"May 11, 2015",5,Great delivery service,Ordered a dress at 10pm arrived next day at 10am. Always have fantastic offers on
"May 11, 2015",5,Geat website,"Love this website. Great products. Never had any issues except one time that I received a poor quality item, however they were very kind when I contacted them and refunded me. I believe the customer service to be good and it is definitely a reliable website."
"May 09, 2015",5,Really fast dealing with an issue,"I bought a pair of Religion Shoes from ASOS recently, but I choose the wrong shoe size for it. Was a little bit upset, because of my own stupidity, because I have simply chosen the wrong one myself... So I saw in the delivery bag that there are some return/refund forms. Quickly filled it in, hoping they will swap the size and return it to me. (Was actually prepared to lose both my money and the shoes) Surprisingly for me -> Went to the post office - no charge on the ship, 3 days later - new shoes at my doorsteps - this time - perfect size! Reaally surprised! 5/5 Made me happy, will use it again!"
"May 08, 2015",1,Absolutely terrible,"-Due to a system error, the express shipping that I had requested had not gone through. I needed this immediately, and due to this, it was already a day delayed.-I had to cancel the order so that I could re-order it. -Of the two dresses I was sent, one was a wrong dress (also in the wrong size)-I returned both and was only partially refunded. So disappointed by these endless problems, on just one order!"
"May 08, 2015",4,Speedy delivery,"I only have great experiences with Asos, no hassle, loads of choice and speedy delivery"
"May 08, 2015",1,Customer Service is Horrible!!!,"Long story short ASOS has gone down hill since I begin shopping with them almost 5 years ago. They leave off items, parcels go missing and then they refuse to refund. I have a missing parcel over $500 and they had the audacity to say let me know is there anything we can do after I specifically told them it was missing!! Then they emailed me back saying to ship the items back and they will return the funds back to my account. Unbelievable!!!! If you have any issues with these fools just go directly to your bank or credit card company and dispute it that way!"
"May 06, 2015",1,Horrible,"Shoppers beware. ASOS is the absolute worse. They're customer service is next to nill. The lie and tell you one thing and do another and God forbid if you get the same person (you can only contact them through email, FB or Twitter) with a generic message back. I have been fighting with them over a refund that I shouldn't have even had to request as the order was to be cancelled but they sent anyway. Then they're only trying to refund part of my money. No dice. I have filed an affidavit of fraud against the company."
"May 05, 2015",1,Poor customer service,"I placed an order that took almost 2 weeks to arrive!  Never had this experience with an online company.  I complained about it and while they responded promptly, all they offered was a 10% discount on a future order with a code that expired in 1 month!  I asked for an extension of the code validity length and was told that wasn't possible and I could join them on Facebook or Twitter to find out about discounts.  I'm done with them!"
"May 05, 2015",1,ASOS breached sales contract,"BEWARE this online retailer do not refund cancelled orders,  email requests go unanswered my bank are taken action to recover the funds , asos are very obstructive with no direct means of communication arrogant and unconcerned attitude to customer service as well as practices that verge on  deception."
"May 04, 2015",5,Fast and AMAZING !,"I ordered from here Friday 1st may. And I already got my package this Monday! I have never experienced a delivery so fast over weekend and I am truly impressed!"
"May 04, 2015",1,Avoid if you want to receive what you've bought!,I received an email stating I had been refunded as I'd returned the goods. Remarkable as I never received the parcel and had already notified them that it had not arrived by the promised date. Replies were entirely generic and useless.
"May 01, 2015",1,Worst experience ever,I had the worst experience ordering from ASOS. I was really excited to order this item from the store but when it came in it was a different item entirely. When asked for a replacement the item was out of stock. I will not be ordering from this site ever again.
"May 01, 2015",1,Terrifying Experience!!!!!!!!!!,"I ordered a pair of shoes about a week from today.  My order was supposed to be here yesterday. I have not received a update or anything notifying me that there is a delay, or If i will receive them.  I am so disappointed, a few friends advised me that this site is good and now this happens.  I wish that i did look into reviews.  The shoes i ordered was for a event i have to attend tomorrow and it does not look like i will have them.  There is no tracking number, What kind of service is this?  The products look nice but the service is horrible . Very disappointed customer!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"April 30, 2015",1,Horrible experience!,"Why didn't I read the reviews before ordering?! I ordered a dress for my baby shower and paid to have it 2 day express shipped. My confirmation email stated the garment would arrive on or BEFORE 4/27. I did not receive the garment until 6pm on 4/29. That isn't even the worst part! When I opened the package it was 2 SIZES TOO BIG!!! I contacted ""customer service"" and was told I ordered a US size 10 which is equivalent to a UK 14. Only problem is that the tag says UK 18 and US 14. I will never order from this site again which is sad because they have great designs."
"April 29, 2015",5,Satisfied,"I've ordered from ASOS.com 3-4 times I think, and every time, my stuff came in about 5-6 days. (I live in Denmark) Good prices too :)No problemo"
"April 29, 2015",1,Scam,"The worst customer service! The quality is very poor, shipping is supper slow. When I returned the items, didn't refund the full amounts. Stay away from shopping here. Scam place!!'"
"April 27, 2015",5,Consistent,"One thing I love about ASOS is their consistency. Every time I order I receive what was expected, the pictures are a true representation of the clothes. Its and added bonus that they have the catwalk videos of their clothing. Always reliable, and my go to online shopping !"
"April 27, 2015",1,Worst delivery service ever-a pigeon would be quicker,"Last time i checked Northern Ireland was part of the UK yet it's taken nearly 5 days for two dresses to get to me?! SERIOUSLY ASOS, YOU need to MAJORLY review your delivery options."
"April 26, 2015",5,Good Service,"I have been purchasing from Asos for over a year now, and I have not yet experienced anything bad.  They have delivered very good quality clothing and service.  I had a problem a few weeks a ago, where an item was faulty, I emailed them regarding the Jacket and told them that after wearing it a couple of times the threads started going lose. They sent me a replacement immediately. Which was just the best service I have received from any online retailer for a long time.   5 stars from me ! :)"
"April 25, 2015",5,first time very happy,Receives goods today ordered 21st  packaged neatly and was notified every step of they way. Items lovely much better then other clothing sites. Thanks guys
"April 24, 2015",1,"UNRELIABLE, IMPOSSIBLE TO DEAL WITH, STAY AWAY","Like many others, I placed an order for a wedding suit and paid for an overnight DHL delivery (within Europe!). The delivery was first attempted only 8 days later, 3 days after the wedding. By that stage we left Europe. Aside from the very awkward no-suit situation, my endless attempts to receive my money for items that have never been received has so far been unsuccessful. I was forced to file a dispute with PayPal to sort the things out. In the meantime, ASOS keeps giving promises to 'get back shortly', to 'resolve issues within 2 weeks', and has not fulfilled a single one: no refund, no response, the issue has been dragging on for a month!! Never again will I deal with them. IF you have a misfortune of dealing with them, my advice: always use Paypal. Always!"
"April 23, 2015",1,I've been robbed!! BEWARE!,"I ordered a denim jacket. I had to return it due to the size I ordered not fitting correctly. About 10 days after returning the item, I was emailed a refund confirmation message stating that I would be refunded within 10 days. Well, that never happened. I then emailed asos after the ten days to see when I'd get my refund. And they said wait another 2-3 days. Well, I waited 2-3 days, and 2-3 days turned into 2-3 weeks. Even after that, I still didn't get my refund. Well let's just say 2 months has passed and I still ain't  gotten my got'damn money back. I emailed them again and they wanted bank statements and other personal info, and from there I couldn't trust it and was convinced it was a scam. I would persuade buyers to not shop here unless you want to be robbed of your hard earned money. Asos is ridiculous."
"April 23, 2015",2,hello no.,"i ordered a pair of shoes for my best friend for her birthday. it seemed as if everything was fine: they sent me a tracking number and a delivery date, all that i forwarded to her. they came on time, thank goodness, but they were the wrong size. i specifically ordered a size 11, my best friend says she received 9. what!? like how does that happen? let's just hope i can get my money back without any confusion."
"April 22, 2015",5,Brilliant service,"My order came to over £100, so I had free next day delivery. I had not placed my order until 9pm, but I received it by lunchtime the next day. I needed to return two of the items, the shoes were too large (my fault, I thought I could get away with a larger size as my size was out of stock) and a dress which did not suite me at all. I sent the parcel back with the post office, using the pre-paid returns label and I had my full refund for these 2 items within about a week. Very efficient service. If I had one complaint, it would be that it seems a little faceless, I did not speak to anyone. But I was kept well informed with automated emails about despatch, delivery, tracking information, and when they had received my returned parcel back. Excellent online service, and great products."
"April 21, 2015",4,Good,Great service & range of products :)
"April 21, 2015",1,item return ripoff,"Unless you have returned your item by registered mail to ASOS there is no way of determining if they ever receive the item and it is impossible to get a refund. Wonder how many others have had this problem?I was left over $65 out of pocket from returning an item when ASOS had shipped the incorrect to me in the first instance."
"April 21, 2015",1,Scam site,"Asos is a scam. They mine your personal data to get you to buy deals that arent that great to begin with. Dont give them your birthday, much less cooies of your ID.   They have no customer service and are maddening to try to deal with. Never again!"
"April 21, 2015",1,worst scammy scumbags,All you have to do is search for the scams these guys pull and youll never risk doing business with them again!
"April 21, 2015",1,Got way overcharged,"Beware when buying from Asos because I recently bought some t-shirts and during delivery, got an email saying that I need to pay over 100$ to have the order cleared from customs. They are not responsible for paying customs and duty, so expect to pay 20-30% more than the checkout price.But they do have a nice store."
"April 19, 2015",3,Hmm... expect it to be better,"I had mediocre experiences with ASOS. I just felt they couldve had better customer service. Shopped many times with them, i think they had wearable and trendy clothes. prices could get a little high sometimes, but they had regular discount, although it wasnt really something big. Shipping to US took forever, and I live in NYC, where everything/everytime i online shop usually took soo fast! They sent wrong items twice, and they had no efficient contact method to customer service such as Live chat or direct email. as much as i like to look around here, i cant be bothered to shop so often, id rather look at US online shops, they have great items too, and took much faster with better customer service where u can ask quick question and solve issues very quick!"
"April 19, 2015",4,All good.,"It was all god, except that you have to pay for returns. It's really expensive!"
"April 16, 2015",5,The best,"I ordered 2 days ago from UK with the DHL express delivery, and it came today.The product was in perfect shape when it arrived. I will definently use this website again, and i will recommend it to all of my friends/familly"
"April 16, 2015",5,Love ASOS,"Personally, I LOVE ASOS. Clothes are great and affordable, free shipping to Aus locations and delivers quickly."
"April 14, 2015",5,Pleasant first time.,"My first experience with ASOS was a good one, always had updates for my package along with a tracking number, they sent a second one once the customs cleared. The package was also delivered a day earlier than expected! I am very satisfied and may order again from them soon. :)"
"April 13, 2015",5,Good,"this is a good company my experience with them was great. First time shopper on asos- package came on time, one dress didtn fit so i returned in, they refunded me back to my credit card within 10 days . perfect, hassle free!"
"April 11, 2015",1,OH MY GOSH!!!,"My order came with a dirty Christmas sock!!! WTH! I DIDNT ORDER A DIRTY CHRISTMAS SOCK. This is not a joke, nor would I be on here reviewing if it weren't true. I have a pic but there isnt a place for a picture. Never again. lol."
"April 10, 2015",5,Excellent,"Everything came on time, and came exactly as I ordered  it. When I had a question, they responded to me immediately with no hesitation. They are a reputable company, and  LOVE my new clothes!! I will absolutely order from them again."
"April 09, 2015",5,Great shop!,"I've shopped many times at ASOS, and I've only experienced great products and service. One time somehow my package delivery failed, and then ASOS gave me a promotion code for my next buy.Only positive experiences from here!"
"April 09, 2015",1,You'll have to pay to return your items,"I bought two pairs of shoes which did not fit me . Now I have to send them back to ASOS in Poland - but ASOS will not pay for the return, though I bought for 1,700 DKK - and now I have to pay 300 DKK to return the goods. ASOS could put a label in the box they've send the items in so we can send the goods back to ASOS for a lower price. ASOS can only give me my money back, not sent me the shoes in the right size. That is so sad!"
"April 08, 2015",5,Excellent Service,Wonderful payment system and delivered ahead of time!
"April 07, 2015",3,Very unhappy about the Premium service,"I've been enjoying the Amazon Prime service for a few months now and wanted to give the Asos Premium a try. At the end of the day, I don't shop on Asos often enough to justify it but I wouldn't mind it if it wasn't for the Asos magazine that I now receive every two months and which is nothing more than a pile of ads for teenagers and fashion advice for teenagers, completely unadapted as I am definitely not a teenager (and Asos knows it as they have my date of birth :)). Once I had enough of carrying the magazine to the trash bin every two months and decided to get out of the Premium service I had to spent the entire evening on the Asos website (no way of unsubscribing from the mobile app) as there was some trouble with the site. To sum up, it was very easy to get started, it brought me nothing but trouble and I cannot get out of it now that I want to. Very disappointing of what is in general a trustworthy site providing seamless service."
"April 06, 2015",1,3rd time it did not arrive,"Why my order did not arrived for the 3rd time?I'm receiving orders i make on other sites to my postal office , my adress is ok in your system but after i wait for 1 month you are saying  every time  that the package returned back without no explanation.Why are you not sending my orders? I don't know why i even bother but this has gone too far."
"April 01, 2015",1,Do not purchase from asos,"Think twice about placing an order with asos *BEWARE*I ordered a pair of trainers for a present and was informed the delivery will arrive within 3 days, all good so far! Later that day I received an email to say it will arrive within 10 days, a quick email to them to them about the delivery dates and was told they could cancel the order and I reorder selecting next day service. Why should I do that this was not my fault.Now 3 days after placing the order I received an email saying they was out of stock not sure when they was getting stock if at all and refunded the order. What a waist of time They have no phone number all is done via email as they are probably not trained in customer service at all  Poor poor poor service  Don't bother they won't have stock waist your time and now I have to wait 10 days for my money back  They even still have the trainers on there site which can still be purchased  So some poor customer will have the same issues I have experienced"
"April 01, 2015",1,Twice,"I bought a dress and a pair of shoes, they all got damaged."
"April 01, 2015",5,Love this site,I have used ASOS for about 5 years and its only getting better. Both desktop and mobile websites are very easy to use. Their customer care team are very quick to respond and I fully trust them.
"April 01, 2015",5,Thank you asos,"Just got my loafers today. Expected date was 03/26. Pretty decent as 28,29th were weekends. Loafers are exactly what i expected to be. Fits perfectly as they sent me the right size. To be honest i expected something to go wrong since reviews on asos are super nagative but i guess it not always like that. Only thing is... canada post charges you 30% for duty tax shat lol"
"March 31, 2015",2,Sucks.,"I ordered a package March 9 and it was suppose to come in March 17th. it never came in & i gave if a few days, but it never came. I needed it by March 28th so got in contact with customer service and they said they would send a replacement order. I told them when i would need it by so they supposedly sent it through express delivery but it never came in on time. It finally came in March 31st. I doubt I will order from this company again because it i concierge and poor service."
"March 30, 2015",5,"First time ordering, great service!","I bought a dress off of ASOS for around $200 (CAN$). Shortly after ordering, I received a confirmation e-mail saying that I would receive the package on March 27th 2015. Shipping was great (I got it for free since I spent over $50) and it was quick! It took about two weeks, coming from the UK to Canada. However, when my package didn't arrive on March 27th, I e-mailed their customer care. I got an e-mail back really quickly, and they apologized and told me to wait a few more days. 2 days later, I got my dress! The dress looks a little bit different than it does in the picture, but all in all, it's all good! Their customer care was satisfactory, as they replied quickly and politely. The prices of the clothes on the website are also fair -- it depends on what you're purchasing, IMO. For the dress I bought, $200 was a fair price!  I'm glad I found this website and I will definitely be ordering from here in the future! BE SURE to check your sizes and to also convert if necessary :-)"
"March 30, 2015",1,Total jokes,Won't even go into detail on this but basically their company and the way it is run is a total joke! Forever receiving incorrect parcels! It's like trying to communicate with a bunch of monkeys.
"March 30, 2015",1,Very poor quality,"ive had enough of wasting my time now, the ASOS ""quality"" is beyond terrible. Cheap, nasty and always too small ( another way of cutting costs I assume) wasting more of my time writing this. Done."
"March 30, 2015",5,One of the top online stores I order from,"I order from Asos several times a year, and I think they are doing a great job. All of the items have clear descriptions, and if you read them carefully you can't go wrong with sizes and the quality of the materials. I have always received my orders in time, and my last order even came earlier than I expected. The only time when I received a faulty item, a dress which arrived without its belt, I contacted them and they decided to refund a part of the dress' value. I don't know why many people have had such bad experiences with Asos, but remember that when the items leave Asos' storehouse, you do not know who exactly handles them.  Congrats Asos for your great service and multitude of products. I will keep ordering from you."
"March 30, 2015",1,garbage...,The  worst  service ever..will not order from here again. If you reading this review and planning on ordering form this trash website DONT DO IT..
"March 29, 2015",1,Worst Customer Service Experience,"My shipment of a dress for almost $200.00 did not arrive in time for my event, even if they promised it would. 5 days later it has still not come, there is no phone line and no tracking number. As far as I understand it is lost, and the company is doing nothing at all to accommodate."
"March 29, 2015",5,Consistently good service,"- Always get orders within outlined time- Clothes true to size- payment system is very convenient, straightforward and easy to use"
"March 29, 2015",3,Not great.,"I bought a crochet beach top, when it arrived it had a fault right in the front so I filled the form out saying I wanted a replacement, over a week went by and after a couple of phone calls I got a message saying that my £25 has been refunded even though I asked for an exchange. Going back on the web site to reorder it and noticed that the price had gone up to £28 three pound dearer.  I did order it because I liked it but in the future I will shopping elsewhere, for being greedy and the sake of £3 they have lost a good customer, shame.This is an update on the above review. After Asos read this we received and apology and a refund of the £3, which was rounded up to £5 and they also gave us a £10 voucher, a mistake by Asos rectified. When mistakes are dealt with like this it restores one faith in the company."
"March 28, 2015",1,Some of the worst customer service ever. Not worth it.,"Okay, here's my experiences with ASOS: 1. For my first order, things went fine. Then, a few weeks later, I started receiving a style magazine (don't remember which one - Cosmopolitan, maybe?) in the mail. I hadn't ordered it, so I had no idea why I was receiving it. Called the magazine, and found out it was ASOS. I contacted ASOS and they said it was included with my order (even though it didn't advise me of that anywhere on the order page). So ASOS signed me up for a magazine I didn't want as part of my order. 2. My next order was a coat and a sweater. The coat is made by ASOS. I like the style, but I can tell you their stuff is cheaply made. The coat, which is a stretchy cotton, is pilling all over, and I've only worn it about 4 times. 3. For my next order, I got a good price on shoes (not made by ASOS) and was excited to receive them. About a week after my order, ASOS contacted me and advised that the shoes were out of stock and they were refunding my money. This in spite of the fact that their website continued to show that the shoes were available in my size. Grrr. 4. My most recent misery was a pair of Shellys London shoes. It's my third pair. Shellys London is always 2 size differences between the UK size and the US size. I ordered a size US 7 (which was the only option. The ASOS website didn't ask what UK size I wanted). I received the shoes, but received a UK 4, and it's printed on the shoes that they are a US 6. That's when the fun began. I contacted ASOS and said I received the wrong size. Long story short, I sent and received about 8 emails, all from a different agent each time, and was told first that there was a ""problem with the sizing"" (don't understand that, since the shoes state right on them what size they are in US sizes) and I could return them. I said no, I wanted the shoes I ordered. Then the next agent said she was ordering a replacement. I kept writing back and asking for confirmation that they were sending a UK 5. Finally an agent wrote back and said the replacement order was a UK 4. You know. The wrong size that I'd already received. I wrote back and asked ASOS to cancel a replacement of a UK 4, since that's what I already had, and the next agent told me they could only order one replacement, and since the wrong size had been ordered, I would have to return the shoes and order again. Two problems with that: first, it was pretty clear that if I ordered my size again, they would keep sending me a size smaller, and second, I got the shoes on a special and they cost more now. No response. Asked twice for a supervisor to review all of the emails (you can't actually call ASOS - only write the nitwits at their email service). The first ""reply"" was just a return of my email, with nothing written by ASOS. I wrote again to ask for a supervisor to review all of the emails, and they've gone radio silent. Seriously. ASOS is not worth it. It's like trying to communicate with a bunch of 13-year olds who've been drinking Red Bull all day."
"March 28, 2015",3,Shipping takes a while,I had ordered things from ASOS before and once it took about 2 months for a pair of measly socks to arrive luckily when ordering my prom dress it didnt take much longer than 3 weeks. That restored my faith in ASOS.
"March 25, 2015",1,Delivery service is great but Returns (hermes) is terrible,"ASOS offered DPD returns before but they now use Hermes who lose half of all return parcels! I buy from Asos because returns were easy, which is important due to the nature of the products (you buy 4 pairs when you need only 1 for perfect  fit) but I think I'm considering buying from elsewhere to avoid my returns from going missing. ASOS please go back to using DPD for returns!"
"March 25, 2015",1,horrible service,"The ""help"" desk is a joke. They do not honor valid promo codes. When I emailed about it they refused to do anything about it and during the wait the shoes I wanted old out :/ ... I was prepared to spend close to $500.  **also I am waiting for my refund on a swimsuit that didn't work out that I sent back 2 weeks ago... they claim it has to do with ""snow in Ohio""... there hasn't been a lot of snow in Ohio in 4 weeks. Not worried about the refund just disappointed in the lack of customer service."
"March 20, 2015",5,Love it,"I have ordered several times from ASOS and I'm always happy about my products. There was an instance when I ordered lipstick and got the wrong shade. Unfortunately, I noticed this after opening the emballage, but decided to contact the customer service anyway with pictures as proof. I got a reply the first time that I could pay for a new lipstick because I opened the emballage so I couldn't send it back, and I thanked them for their reply (even though I wasn't very happy with it). I later got a reply from another staff member telling me that they were very sorry about the mistake and that I could keep the lipstick and they would send me a new one in the right shade - for free! I got my lipstick a few days later, but once again in the wrong shade. I decided to just make a new order instead of complaining to them again. Other than that, I have always gotten the right items and my packages have always arrived. The only problems I have had have been with the postage service here in Denmark (not ASOS' fault). I would absolutely recommend this webshop!"
"March 20, 2015",1,So damn unprofessional..,"March 6 i ordered two Lipbalms online. As i live in Denmark I thought their delivery date March 12 was cool. But i was surprised... I can't think of any more unprofessional treatment.. March 16 i send them an email. I was told to wait 3 working days, and then they asked me to contact my local postoffice. (My localpostcenter couldn't see that they had anything to me...) Today it is March 20, still haven't received the damn lip balms.  The have just answered my second email, and asked after my adress.. (Like they dont have it already - actually they have two - both my workadress and privateadress.....) I just sitting here in Denmark, getting more and more frustrated - missing what i have ordered AND PAYED...... !!!"
"March 20, 2015",5,Never had a problem,Love this website! first place I look for anything! Free shipping and returns make online shopping so easier in case I get the wrong size etc. Will carry on shopping here.
"March 18, 2015",5,No complaints,"Have been shopping at Asos several times, and have never had any problems."
"March 18, 2015",2,Wish I would have read these reviews before I ordered.,"First, how do they not have a phone number listed for customer service?Second, how can items sent through the postal system not have tracking information or number?I order online a lot and I have never dealt with any company like this.  My expected delivery was March 16, 2015 and here it is passed and I still don't have my order.  This is my first time and I'm pretty sure my last time ordering from ASOS.  This really has me worried because I'm very cautious of the online sites I order from.  Hopefully my money didn't get taken because that will be a serious problem!  I hope my order comes some time this week no later then next. I have also emailed them, hopefully I get a response back soon.  If you care and value you money and time, don't order from them."
"March 17, 2015",1,Unhelpful!!,"Shocked by the lack of service received from ASOS ""Customer Care"" after contacting them about my delivery. I emailed them concerned that the courier had tried to deliver the items at lunch time during the week twice and I was at work so unable to accept the delivery. Queue patronising email from ASOS telling me to choose next day evening delivery next time....charming!!!"
"March 17, 2015",1,NEVER TRUST ASOS ESPECIALLY INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING,"I ordered Moschino bag that costs me £178 and it was shipped on 19th Feb and by right I was supposed to received it latest by 10th March . There is NO tracking number provided! (I bet ASOS is using the cheapest 'FREE SHIPPING' option just to cut the cost even for an expensive item). Until now I have not receive my item when asked about it, they asked me to wait until 30th March! Better buy from House of Fraser!"
"March 17, 2015",4,Cheap but high quality products!,"I bought a couple of shirts and a tie for my brother, both were delivered quick and painful! Very satisfied, I'll shop there again soon!"
"March 14, 2015",2,"Two separate orders, both with wrong sizes.","Two separate orders, both with wrong sizes.  Customer support closed out my ""queries"" before resolving them.  ASOS has good prices, and good products.  Just lacking customer service and attention to detail."
"March 14, 2015",5,Favourite place to shop online,I've used ASOS for years now and found them to be extremely reliable! there's been the odd occasion of getting the wrong item shipped or purchasing something that was out of stock but they are always quick to refund. Customer service have always been swift and helpful. I'd recommend ASOS to everyone!
"March 13, 2015",5,Excellent again.,My daughter was looking for a prom dress. She found 2 Lipsy dresses that she loved and they were available on ASOS reduced from £89 to £22 - fantastic! Ordered 2 in each size as my daughter was unsure what size she would be. Order was placed at 9pm Tuesday evening and delivered by 11am the next morning! An unbelievably fast service. Dresses were beautiful and I was able to return the unwanted items for free with the pre-paid label supplied. I have used ASOS many times and they are always excellent.
"March 12, 2015",5,Absolutely Excellent!!!!!,"Customer service was absolutely excellent, dealt with my problem straight away and I couldn't of asked for anymore."
"March 11, 2015",5,Girlfriend Enjoys her gift,"I bought my girlfriend a dress for her birthday, she loved it, its been 3 months and she still wears it occasionally despite me washing it wrong and shrinking it haha!"
"March 10, 2015",5,Great service :),"I was so surprised to see bad reviews on here!!! I've used so many times and had such a great experience with their products and service...one time the items didnt fit me, I sent them back via the sooo easy returns process and was refunded very quickly - perfect service :) thank you asos"
"March 08, 2015",5,Fantastic!,"I had alot of great experience with Asos.com. I've ordered many there many times before, and i've never had problems with the webside. It's a great service, and fast delivery! So i would definitely recommend Asos.com"
"March 08, 2015",1,Bad customer service team,"I ordered an item exactly 2 weeks ago. About 3 days after my order i received an email saying my parcel will be slightly delayed. They did not mention exactly how many days will be delayed. I sent them an email about 4 days ago to ask for updates but nobody replied. Only got a computer generated email  saying they'll get back to me. Now it has been 14 days, no parcel, items are not even shipped yet, and no one from customer service will talk to me. Very disappointed."
"March 06, 2015",5,great service. :),"Could not ask for more from Asos. Customer care team super efficient!! Two orders that I have now purchased have been Fab.Very prompt on their reply via email and very helpful throughout my query. Thank you. Would defo order again!"
"March 04, 2015",3,Just not good enough...,"I’ve used ASOS a few times now and whilst the website and selection of products is usually good and I haven’t had an issue before it’s my most recent order that I felt could have been dealt with better. I ordered my  girlfriend something for her birthday, the box was dumped in my front garden and when I found it there was a pool of water on it that soaked through into the contents. Fortunately what I’d purchased itself came in a box that itself had a presentation box in it so whilst both of these boxes suffered water damage the item at the very centre survived intact and I was able to present it to my girlfriend, albeit quite soggy… Now, I suspect you’re wondering how this is ASOS’ fault but it’s the registering of my complaint and the response that I’m disappointed with. Firstly, after several attempts using the “Contact Us” I found no way to get an email through to them without claiming it was a wrong item that had been delivered – nothing other than packaging was ruined but I had to make a real effort just to get through the labyrinth of a system so it would allow me to make contact with someone. I sent photos and a description of what happened and received a prompt response apologising, saying they’d pass on my experience to the courier and that I could return the item should I wish… This if anything would lead to more aggravation as I’d now have to wait in for delivery again or face the real possibility of a package being left someone even worse like a bin or the doorstep. I explained that a replacement wasn’t desirable and that no further action was required as they obviously had limited means to do anything - this was met with an immediate response apologising again and offering me a 15% discount code to be used within a month. … So, the way they intend to fix the problem I had with delivery and the disappointment is to get me to buy more stuff from them. Ultimately they see me spending more of my money whilst leaving my original concern unresolved is the answer – it isn’t."
"March 02, 2015",1,Absolute nightmare,I bought a gift card for my wife recently. She could not find anything on the site she liked and so asked me to organise a refund. Three days later and 10 emails I still have no joy! Rubbish company who gladly take your cash but will not help when you want a simple refund.Why dont they just provide a phone number!
"February 27, 2015",4,Speedy delivery,"Great range to choose from, never had any issues. Out of all the online clothes delivery companies this is one of the better ones!"
"February 23, 2015",3,asos they are average clothing group,"everything $100 and above is is acceptable at Asos ,however lower priced pieces do not have quality :("
"February 20, 2015",5,My favourite company for online shopping.,"Always some sort of offer going on, especially if you are a Premier member, delivery is ALWAYS on time and packaged correctly!"
"February 18, 2015",5,Perfect!,"I really love shopping at Asos. Im from Denmark and I have never been disapointed in any way. I have always received my clothes before the date they promised me, and I really think that the quality of the clothes is perfect. And really cheap as well!  Love it!"
"February 18, 2015",2,sucks,"sucks most of the timehardly anything that looks like the picturescustomerservice bad because of lacking of moral skillssizes are rarely how they seembad quality etc"
"February 18, 2015",1,awful service.,"I ordered an outfit from here for a concert I was going to. I recieved the item when they said it was going to be delivered, so that was good, but it looked nothing like the pictures in person. I was very disappointed and planned on returning it when I realized there was no return address or exchange forms that came with the item. I then contacted customer service and told them about the problem, not only did it take them a very long time to even respond, but when I did get a response it was VERY rude. They are extremely difficult to deal with and I have yet to receive a return address from them. While in the process of trying to figure what their return address even is, I was informed that you only have 28 days to return an item. Maybe if they would have responded quicker with a return address I could've made the return but no, I still have an ugly dress that no one in their right mind would wear and $50 gone. There is nothing legit about this company and I garuntee that I will never ever buy from them again."
"February 15, 2015",5,I was really impressed!,"So I ordered a scarf on the 10th of February on the website ASOS and I was able to track down my order on the Hermes website. After It said on the 14th of February that my parcel is with my local delivery man I was really happy that I could get my parcel so quick. Later it said on the Hermes website that my parcel is left at the porch but I couldn't find it anywhere, not at my porch and not left at my neighbors. I was really disappointed so I immediately contacted the ASOS customer service for help. They replied to me within 6 hours and offered me to replace my scarf and even upgrade my order to another delivery company so I wouldn't have to be bothered with Hermes again. I'm hoping to get my scarf soon but for now I'm really grateful for the fast and helpful customer service at ASOS and thanks to Jamie!"
"February 13, 2015",5,No issues with first order,"Found a nice looking Tweed wallet on Asos - pretty well priced at £15.00 - order placed on a Sunday, and arrived with no hassles on Wednesday. Can't comment on the quality of customer service as I've never needed to contact them but the order confirmation and despatch emails were timely and gave the info I wanted/needed. The wallet itself looks very nicely made with no imperfections in stitching or finish. Top marks, lads and lasses, I'll be back for more at a later date!"
"February 12, 2015",1,SHOCKING,"Needed an outfit for weekend ordered an ASOS Skater dress on the wednesday for next day delivery to have by thursday so it could be worn on saturday. Fine.Waited all day for the item to arrive at 6pm so that kind of annoyed me regardless i was happy it had came on said date. However i tried on the dress - it was horrible cheap elasticy material so debating wether or not just to wear it as i had no other choice when i noticed a HUGE hole down the seam. I called ASOS customer service - whoever hired the two employees i had dealt with needs shot! they were arrogant and totally rude. After being cut off from the SECOND person i called back as i wanted refunded and absolutely could not fault the third person she arranged for a refund of dress, delivery and assured if i wanted to choose another item i would get that delivered for free too.Unfortunately though that one lovely woman cannot make up for a faulty item and truly awful customer service.Reluctant to shop here again!"
"February 12, 2015",1,This company tries to steal from you,"So, this happened a while back. I had purchased a Bodycon dress from asos.com which was my first and only order I made at the time. I received the dress and I loved it. But, a few months later I was just randomly checking my credit card account and right at the top of my summary showed that I had made a purchase from them. Which I did not!! The purchase was over $63.00!! I immediately filed a dispute with my credit company and was able to get my money back and at the same time, deleted my asos account. Do not sign up for this company!"
"February 12, 2015",5,Great Delivery,Great online shop with veeery fast delivery!
"February 09, 2015",1,Wrong item shipped and no replacement service available due to a glitch,"I ordered a maternity coat on short order for an upcoming trip with expedited shipping. I stayed home all day waiting for the delivery so I wouldn't miss it. It arrived and is not at all what I ordered. I then contacted their customer service and was informed that their replacement service had a ""glitch"" so they could not send out a replacement item. So now I have to waste more of my time returning the wrong product back to them and go search elsewhere for this much needed coat. Very frustrating experience and will not be ordering from them again. Also of note -- the coat that did come is of TERRIBLE quality and when I was searching in vain for the coat I wanted, I found it for 30 quid cheaper from the manufacturer's site (although sold out unfortunately). I can't recommend ASOS."
