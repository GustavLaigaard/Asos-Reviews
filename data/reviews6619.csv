"November 22, 2019",1,Very bad costumer support,"Very bad costumer support . Lately they are making mistakes on the orders , this is the second time that they are sending me the wrong item. I was waiting for about 15 minutes to chat with costumer service, because they do not provide a phone number like all other sites, and I asked how can we resolve the issue and send me the right item with out having to wait all this standard delivery time frame AGAIN, since it was a mistake from asos end . He replied like a machine , like I was communicating with a computer , apologizing and explaining to me the return procedure like I didn't know.. I'm shopping for years from Asos . Thanks for the big help and your excellent costumer support team asos."

"November 22, 2019",1,Customer Care? You need to change the name!,"I have had an ongoing issue with ASOS for quite some months. The discount codes never work for me and I pay for premier delivery and that hasn‚Äôt worked either. I have called customer care - and head office, when you press option 2 for head office it takes you right back to customer care! Customer care do not care about their customers! I have also emailed, instant chatted and used Facebook messenger, begging them all to help me. 4 months later, I am no better off and I have missed three 25% off discount codes. I actually cried on the phone in frustration and was promised a solution. Still waiting.... I wouldn‚Äôt EVER recommend using ASOS. This kind of aggravation just isn‚Äôt worth it."
"November 22, 2019",1,HORRIBLE Customer Service,"Absolutely horrendous experience with everyone involved in this company. They refuse to take blame for their mistakes or offer any kind of help to fix their mistakes. I ordered a jacket from this site and the photo was in mid wash, the color was in mid wash, AND under product details it said ""mid wash finish"". the product name however, was ASOS jacket in light wash. Obviously VERY confusing, but THREE separate places were telling me mid wash. Of course, it comes in and it's light wash. I tried speaking to their customer service and the first time she told me ""This was not a maufacturing error, this was a user error and we change the fact that you ordered the wrong item"" !! Again, I understand that the product name had light wash in it, but the product details, photo, and color option were ALL mid wash!! This was not user error, this was an error on the part of the company. Immediately after I received that message she closed the conversation so I could no longer respond. So, I tried contacting them again, really all I wanted was to swap this jacket for a mid wash one. Well, this one also tells me it's my fault and shows me the correct item I should have ordered for mid wash. Except this one is $35 and my original one I ordered was only $25! And, my original was placed in part of a bigger order in which I received free shipping. So I originally paid $25 and free shipping, and now they're telling me it's my fault and to fix it I have to pay $35 PLUS shipping! BUT to make it worse, I already found the ""mid wash variant"" on their website (exact same product name and colors and everything) BUT FOR $28.50. So not only are they telling me that in order to get the one I want, I'll have to just repurchase a more expensive listing, but they are giving me a MORE expensive listing than their website even shows!! They absolutely refused to do an exchange, price match, give me a free shipping code, etc, anything at all. Just kept repeating this is my fault for ordering the wrong item (which I stand by that I did NOT. they listed the wrong item)"

"November 22, 2019",1,Bad Delivery and customer exeriance - Callum was no help!!!!!,Very bad customer experience with delivery. After paying for next day delivery and prime membership on Wednesday it is now Friday and they are now telling me after i chased it that my delivery wont be with me till next Wednesday. Customer Service Callum wasn't very interested at first and I had to ask him to look into it after he just said sorry to hear you haven't received it yet. Following looking into it he told me it wont be with me till next Wednesday and there was nothing he could do. He wouldn't even refund my delivery or give me any compensation for the service.Very disappointing as wanted it for the weekend (hence why i paid more for delivery) and now i'm going to have to go to the shops anyway to buy something.WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!
"November 22, 2019",1,Late Delivery and No help from Customer Service,Stated on e app that item will arrive by 20th Nov 19. Item was purchased during the 11.11 sale. Did not get any help from the help centre. No tracking number given and i was told to check with my local courier. Shouldnt the checking be on their part?? Wasnt helpful at all as i dont know which local courier they using. So i just hv to wait and get back to them on 3 Dec should the item has yet to be delivered.

Overall I'm not happy with ASOS customer service but I wished they would have told me that tracking isn't available beforehand.Edit: Changed my review. It's after the promise delivery date and no package. Customer support asked to wait further. This is incredibly frustrating and unpleasant to deal with. Wished I didnt waste money on this website. Why give tracking number if it can't be tracked???"

"November 22, 2019",1,If I could score less than 1* I would...,"Placed an order on Saturday to the value of ¬£265, order accepted and provided with a delivery date of Wednesday. By 5pm on Wednesday afternoon, no sign of the order. Contacted customer service on the first occasion to be told by ‚ÄòFrancesca‚Äô that she could ASSURE me that my order would be delivered by the end of the day despite me not receiving an order update or tracking number. When I questioned the points made by ‚ÄòFrancesca‚Äô she cut off the chat. As predicted, since I hadn‚Äôt heard from the local courier, the order did not arrive. Contacted Customer Service online again on Thursday AM, to be informed that they could not provide a further update, no information was available. When I asked to speak to a Manager, ‚ÄòRosie‚Äô informed me that I could not speak to a manager or a more senior member of staff to escalate my concerns as they ‚Äòdon‚Äôt have managers‚Äô. Also informed that I could not obtain a refund, despite the company not fulfilling the order on time. Not satisfied with this response I contacted Customer Service again, to be informed by ‚ÄòDaniella‚Äô that the issue had been passed to a ‚ÄòSpecialist‚Äô team to look into and that I should receive a response within 24 hours, so I expected when I did receive an email from the ‚ÄòSpecialist‚Äô team it was just an email to say they were looking into my order. All of this contact is made via chat or email, making it difficult to express concerns properly, which left me feeling really quite exasperated, as it is becoming more apparent that no communication about my order is not a concern for the company, as they have the money. It also appears that customers are just treated as a number.  Contacted Customer Service on Friday for a further update, hopeful that the ‚ÄòSpecialist‚Äô team may have done something since the 1am email I received saying it was being looked into. Was put on a chat with ‚ÄòEdward‚Äô who appeared to take great delight in informing me that there was no further update and I should just wait to hear. I asked again about escalating the issue and whether he could try and chase the ‚ÄòSpecialist‚Äô team and he said that wasn‚Äôt possible. They would be dealing with other queries and that he couldn‚Äôt give me a timescale as to when I could expect to have an update. It‚Äôs become really apparent that customer service is not a priority for ASOS as a whole. The advisors are not willing to help and seem so blase, avoiding answering questions and continually fobbing you off with a clearly generic response. Being spoken to in a more considerate manner would go someway to help even if it is to simply placate you until the issue is resolved. At no point have I received an apology and the way in which I have been spoken to is abysmal.I appreciate that there can be delays with deliveries and would be more accepting of this if I had some information to go on but it doesn‚Äôt fill me with much confidence that I am still awaiting contact and delivery and the status of my order."

Last guy was pretty helpful, reckoned the parcel could have been lost on the way to the delivery depot so he issued a replacement with their fastest delivery but it still may not arrive on time for what I needed it for! Also said it was subject to stock availability, and I have noticed that one of the items on the order is out of stock, so I guess I'm not getting that part of the order! I will NOT be ordering from ASOS again after this, absolute joke.EDIT: Contacted again after no email was received, they now said I was in a queue to get my problem solved. I was not happy, I spent quite a bit on my order and they just cast you aside like that? I asked for a refund as they had not delivered on their promise of a replacement and they then said I would be in a queue for that which could take days (I was fuming at this point). I then said that if my refund was not done within the hour, I would be contacting PayPal, to which they said ""You're welcome to do that"" followed by calling me the wrong name!

They don‚Äôt respond through most customer service channels and when you can get hold of someone on chat they have about as much information as you do, give conflicting information about deliveries and are of very little use. This time I‚Äôve been waiting for a next day delivery order for 5 days, Hermes haven‚Äôt updated tracking since 4 days ago and they‚Äôve said I have to wait until midnight to get more information or request a refund. More hassle than it‚Äôs worth - I would avoid any company that uses Hermes for deliveries and no longer recommend ASOS because the customer service when things do go wrong is shocking."

ASOS should make an option while before asking for payment whether its a gift and to give an option to write  small message of no more than 20 to 30 words for the recipient to let them know who is it coming from."

I had my student code of 25% so I got some trousers which unfortunately don‚Äôt fit my birthday is next week and the new size I need is low in stock which has happened to me before by the time the exchange occurs the item is out of stock. I therefore was asking if there was any way they would be held over in my new size for when my original trousers are returned or if I could receive a one off promo code to make a new order for them however Darby said no and sent me a returns policy link which I don‚Äôt need as I know it well enough. Just dissappointing when I love ASOS and there is nothing personal the company can do in these cases.

Disgusting customer service, you admit it is your mistake, but do no even offer to rectify it? Appalling service. I will be taking my business elsewhere. Do not recommend"
"November 21, 2019",1,"Dont bother using, you‚Äôll never receive it!","I cant say how disappointed i am in asos if im honest. I have ordered from asos for years and have never had a complaint, but i cant even explain how frustrated ive been. So coming onto here isent blatantly obvious that the team from asos put there own good reviews in as they start with a name everytime, and they must think people are stupid because thats what my management at work make us do to get the company score up as there doing so bad at the moment with customer service and deliverys. I spent ¬£200 on a order on next day evening delivery for it not to turn up. I got in contact with ‚Äòcity sprint‚Äô which i had never had as a courier before. They were rude on the phone and would not talk to me and said i had to go through asos to follow up my order. I went on asos live chat and was told it was due to floods, which i was calm about but knew i was getting fobbed off as they were able to go round but they refused to. after two tries to delivery, on the third day i knew the road was back open so there was no doubt in my mind that it would get delivered that day. Never heard anything from the delivery company in terms of tracking, delivery update or email to say it was on its way unlike the days before. 4 days went by before i got in contact with asos again to ask for them to get in contact with the company to follow up and where my order was, to then find out they had actually lost my delivery on the first day and never intended on telling me. i was furious but needed to stuff on my order so ordered again but went for next day delivery instead of evening, hoping for it to be hermes or DPD as i have never had problems with these company's. It was meant to be delivered on the 14th and it is now the 21st. This is threw hermes and on the 14th i was given a tracking code which assured me on the app that it was going to be delivered between 3-5pm that day. I had waited in ALL DAY downstairs to make sure i would not miss the knock on the door for it to never turn up. That night i went onto the live chat once again to explain how furious i was for a rude ‚ÄòThomas‚Äô to pie me off and tell me its out of there hands and i had to wait till the 20th to get back in contact before exiting the chat. I have tried getting in contact with asos last night and today, and keeping getting put in a chat with ‚ÄòAnastasia‚Äô who wont reply back in the chat -.- on email they will not respond back to me and are taking no responsibility for the matter. Id try normal 3-5 day delivery but il just assume there just not going to deliver anything to me. What is the point letting me order if I'm never going to receive my order and you just keeping having to give my money back? Also it is ridiculous that you are unable to get in contact with someone superior, they told me they take my complains on board and that there isn't a complains procedure.. every company (specially one as big as asos) has a friggin complains procedure. What a joke pah. They wont take what I'm saying on board and keep just taking my delivery charge.. i want my order not a bloody charge took off for a delivery I'm never going to receive."

I contacted customer service to enquire how long it would be till I got my replacement order and they said it would take up to SEVEN WORKING DAYS to even receive my order let alone to when I‚Äôd get a replacement of my order. I informed them that this was pretty urgent and I needed a replacement and I‚Äôd already sent the item back for exchange. They told me I should have sent back for a refund and that if I needed it urgently then I would have to REPEAT my order to the tune of another ¬£200!!! By this point I‚Äôd be almost ¬£400 down, with potentially two suits on their way back, and all before Xmas. The worst bit was they ended this whole condescending exchange with a smiling emoji after suggesting I should fork out more money. Absolutely awful service."

"November 20, 2019",1,WARNING ABOUT AN ASOS PLOY,"I have been a customer of ASOS for many years, however since they decided to change strategy around refunds/deals etc things have been going down. But this latest one is not so much a scam but a devious ploy that I think will make them ¬£Millions. ASOS used to offer a straight 20% off but recently it changed to ¬£30 off when you spend ¬£170 which wasn't far off 20% so I bought some items.However when some jeans arrived they didn't fit I sent them back - something ASOS have always been great for. However 3 weeks later I hadn't heard a thing so I called them to be told they are keeping the jeans, as the ¬£30 off was when I spent ¬£170 this meant that there was no discount !!!!! I asked if I could have a larger size and was told this wasn't possible, I asked for maybe vouchers or credit to buy something else and again was told this is not possible. So if I hadn't gone out of my way to post the jeans back I would still have them in my possession but because i posted them back I lose the jeans and my ¬£28... I wonder how many other people this will happen to? Are ASOS banking on this to make them a quick extra profit? The staff seemed to jump immediately to our Ts&Cs state this (they were changed recently) Its almost as if this was a strategic move... and I bet its made a lot of money"

I spoke to two people who were unwilling to help and rude. If you refer to the phone call around 13:00 today made regarding my order you will understand my upset and frustration. The issues was I needed a parcel for tomorrow evening for an event however you have sent it on the late delivery to my office between 6pm-10pm. I stressed the urgency of getting my parcel and that my office is closed so I need this to be delivered earlier. The customer service rep didn‚Äôt listen to me at all, didn‚Äôt give me steps to resolve the issue, didn‚Äôt care that I would be shoeless for my event and had a disgusting attitude. This is the worst service I have ever received, as someone who orders weekly from ASOS I do not expect this level of service. The lady on the live chat just sent me automated messages and then closed the chat. This is the most disgusting service I have every received and I will never order from ASOS again. Now I‚Äôve had to arrange to drive half an hour across the city to collect the parcel that I was told nearly was returned!!!!I need an explanation for this."

I have purchased from ASOS a number of times over the years and nine times out of ten I end up disappointed, my last order was the last straw for me. Packages are never delivered on time and when you ask for an explanation, you're advised to ""wait another week"", despite the website advising a ""on or before"" date before purchasing, This is simply not good enough! - surely this is some kind of false advertisement. I appreciate delays happen but every time? This cannot be a coincidence. The customer service team seem to have no intention of helping, so much so, I'm not sure why they are even there. They add nothing. The quality of ASOS own brand clothing is woeful, the clothes start to fall apart after days. Infuriating."

"November 20, 2019",1,BAD EXPERIENCE,I am convinced that ASOS really doesn‚Äôt care about their customers. I purchased some pants that ended up being the wrong size. They don‚Äôt offer exchanges in US so I was told to return them and just repurchase them. Well when I went to buy them the price increased by $12. I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs fair that I would have to pay that price when I had already got it for the discounted price. I spoke to customer service and they couldn‚Äôt resolve after taking forever to figure out a decision. I will no longer give ASOS my business and will tell me friends about my experience.

"November 20, 2019",2,Incorrect item received (Club L Cap Sleeve Embroidery Detail Jumpsuit),"The product was great! But I did not receive the Club L Baroque Sequin Jumpsuit; instead, I received the Club L Cap Sleeve Embroidery Detail Jumpsuit. In order to receive a refund, since the Cap Sleeve Jumpsuit is less expensive than the Baroque Sequin Jumpsuit, I need to return and re-purchase the items (which for me is a hassle since I have university mailing that is only open certain times in the day. I also don't have vehicular transport, so I have to locate and go to the nearest UPS dropoff site by foot). In terms of the product, the zipper tends to get stuck near the belt area, but when it is on, it looks good. It is very form-fitting, so be warned of that. Also note that the jumpsuit is really meant for tall and skinny people. I am 5'6"" and a US size 4 jumpsuit grazes the floor when I wear inch heels. Again, note that this review is for the Club L Cap Sleeve Embroidery Detail Jumpsuit."

I had a delivery stolen and was inquiring about what to do and the carriers the company uses and received horrible service. I was asking about carriers and the agent Sarah tells me I can pick it up on store and I explained where I live it's not close or convenient and she proceeds to say that I can just get a refund which I did not want so I said I would wait and see what follow up email says after they have investigated. After the chat ends I get an email stating I am getting a refund and will not get a replacement for my package. So clearly your customer service does what they want and doesn't listen to what the customer is requesting. And then she had the audacity to send a list of locations for in store pick up which I said I did not want. So now I have no package and am more annoyed by dealing with people who don't listen.

I was also told I can't speak to their manager because they are not customer facing (very unprofessional) This is a large amount of money and the parcel was posted back only a day late. It's disgusting that they won't make any exception for such a large amount of money and short period of time. The customer services just seem to fob you off, and they couldn't even tell me their complaints procedure, or give me a phone number so i could speak to someone. I feel completely fobbed off by them."

I spoke with a rep named Callum, he verified the item was in stock and said to try it through the desktop browser. Hopefully that works out.The first two times I tried paying via Klarna. I noticed that the 3rd time there was a price change, the item was now listed under $50.  With Klarna you can only make purchases with items over $50. Wondering if maybe that price change caused some kind of glitch & had something to do with the item not going through the first two times. Or if, in fact, it did have something to do with the iPhone app.Anyway, appreciate the help.  Hope my order goes through, I really want that jacket!Andrew"

They are so ineffective at sorting delivery issues because they basically accept no responsibility. If a courier misplaces your item then you are out of pocket, with no explanation until it finds it way back to them, which could take weeks. All ASOS can say is ‚Äúit‚Äôs not our fault.‚Äù They have lied to me, ignored me... just the worst customer service for such a big company."

I‚Äôm a premier member so have unlimited next day delivery, however, I can‚Äôt remember the last time my next day delivery worked! I know this isn‚Äôt ASOS, however using DPD as a delivery firm is really not working. I was at home recovering from surgery, when I received my hour deliver slot from DPD, all of a sudden 1 minute past my delivery slot and I got a text to say no one was in. Absolutely ludicrous! And this isn‚Äôt the first time it‚Äôs happened. It‚Äôs just a shame now that I cannot rely on ASOS for prompt delivery and the service I have paid for. Gutted."

The items were out of stock so i did not want to do this. They said i could take the items to a repair shop, get a quote from them, then go back to Asos and give them a certified quote and wait for them to decide if they wanted to pay for it or not. ABSOLUTE joke for me to have to pull out all the stops when they have sent faulty items that i paid for. Will be shopping from the original retailers from now on who will actually help when there is a problem. When i told the agent how disappointed i was with the service he said 'if that was all i could hang up now'. Incredibly rude."

The funny part is that all the items were in stock, not even low on stock. I was not reimbursed for what I paid in duties and taxes on all 7 items (6 of which weren't delivered) and extra fees for express shipping. I cannot reorder the items because I ordered  them during 25% sale, which is no longer valid. How hard would it be to just resend the missing items?"

I‚Äôve been told twice by incredibly unhelpful representatives (over Twitter and messenger, as I‚Äôve been unable to get through to calling them) that my package will potentially arrive on 21st November (no reason/ explanation why it‚Äôs that date specifically). So I‚Äôm now expected to wait at home (I have a full time job) and hope that it turns up, only then to post it back to them in order to be fully refunded. A complete farce and appalling customer service. I‚Äôve been a loyal customer for 10 years and I‚Äôve never known the customer service to be this bad. Equally ASOS, when signing off messages regarding complaints, it reads as very condescending to end a message with ‚Äúhave a nice day‚Äù after being totally unhelpful (either that or stop using bots to answer delivery issues)."

There have been times where they have sent me the wrong order, however, they have always been relatively quick to resolve the issue. When I do get in contact with them the staff are very friendly and helpful. It is my favourite place to purchase clothes and I love how they have a petite section."

Live chat sucks and you have no idea how long you‚Äôll have to wait to talk to someone. Eventually I tried again and they resolved my issues.

Firstly, they have said they failed to deliver my parcel on Saturday because they could not locate the property. In 25 years I have never had a problem with parcels been delivered to this address. They also never tried to phone. I was using the tracker online and the status was that it would be delivered the next day - which it wan't. I then had to contact them directly - after verifying all of the address information, they told me it didnt match and ended the chat very abruptly. This experience would seriously make me reconsider ordering with ASOS again as I now don't think I will get my delivery for when i need it."

On Monday contacted by ASOS and couriers stating item out for delivery...never arrived. Contacted ASOS told to wait til 25/10, no chance I want a full refund and won't be accepting delivery. But they won't do this and want me to wait til 25th. Already wasted two days...very bad communication from their delivery partners. Will never use ASOS again"

They are sneaky with their wording so that they can sound professional and like they are trying to help but they aren't.  I had to pay an additional $30 to return my parcels because they did not send me enough postage.  I spoke with a customer service representative, named Danielle, for about 45 minutes through chat and she ended the chat without giving me any sort of alternative solution.  I tried to rejoin the chat, hoping to speak to someone else and it took about another 15 minutes before some one would chat with me. I then chatted with the second representative Amie for almost 40 minutes.  She was a little nicer, but still unhelpful and again ended the chat on me.

But she was excellent she is the one that went above and beyond to contact FedEx etc. She did everything.   However the first girl Ravika was horrible. She wanted me to wait a couple of days.  The girl who got everything done and organized was the best. She contacted FedEx and everything because FedEx wanted to get ahold of you. The number they had for shipping just kept ringing. Get rid of Ravika. Horrible.   Thanks to the second person for all her accomplished efforts and patience.
"November 18, 2019",4,Lianne was very helpful,"Lianne was very helpful, but another Customer Service rep is the reason I will never shop at ASOS again.I reached out because I did not receive an order confirmation email but the order was processed and posted on my credit card statement. When I initially reached out, the first representative I spoke to named Grant, told me the order had never been processed because my card declined the payment. I told him I was looking at my card statement and was seeing it as having been processed and posted. He told me I would need to reach out to American Express and take it up with them and disconnected the chat before I would share confirmation from Amex that I had been charged the close to $200 for the order. I connected to another rep, Lianne and she was far more helpful. I explained the situation, shared the Amex provided statement with her and she actually asked for some additional info including my address, full name and birthdate. She then escalated to the correct team that can further assist me. I appreciate her help, but this will likely be the first and last time I purchase from ASOS because this experience was pretty horrible."

Even if you select exclusively ""main collection"", there are a lot of ""curves"" or ""plus"" showing in the search page. Calling morbidly obese people ""curve"" promotes unhealthy lifestyle. No that's FAR MORE than curvy. ASOS is such a company: Wherever there's a market, you just can't resist making bloody money even though it will promote dangerous lifestyle.3.

In a chat with Navpreet, when I told them all of this, they weren‚Äôt very understanding and I asked for some return bags since I can‚Äôt use the original box.

I'm fed up of being given the run around by customer services, somebody needs to investigate and sort the issue rather than referring to ""process"" which clearly isn't working in this case.Update: The order cannot be delivered (blame delivery partner or customer, anyone but ASOS, when we already know that they sent it to the wrong depot) - wait 10 days for ASOS to receive the parcel back and refund the order.  *No apology*Nobody bothered to talk to the delivery partner YODEL despite them stating the seller needs to contact them *Broken process - if ASOS had looked into it when the issue was flagged and not kept fobbing me off, the delivery would probably be on its way - I would have my order and they would keep their order funds*3 hours of my life wasted trying to get customer service to sort the issue, to no avail*Still no maternity wear or coat - the baby will come before the delivery!"

Customer services was awfully textbook and robotic, showing no real understanding of what was going on. Extremely annoyed with this and lost ¬£10 for the express delivery I didn‚Äôt even receive."

"November 18, 2019",1,Disappointing,"I have never had an issue with ASOS deliveries, however a recent one, I purchased some shoes which are usually very expensive during one of their 30% off sale periods. I paid for express shipping, and after a week I still had not received my parcel and the tracking had stopped, so I contacted customer service through the live chat. I had to talk to two separate people, and both tried to tell me that it had been delivered already, while I continually insisted it was not even possible. where I live, deliveries do not take place on Sunday's - which is when they were insisting it was delivered - at 5 in the morning even though the tracking stopped in the major city in my state, and never reached me.The incompetence of the customer service team was made evident even more, when after eventually being referred to a specialist team to investigate the issue, they emailed me informing me that they had refunded the amount of my order. Apart from the shipping. This meant I had to take more time to email them a very lengthy email about how ASOS had failed to deliver my order, and how I was unsure how them failing to do this meant I should still be paying a ridiculous amount of money for delivery. After this hassle, of course it would be reasonable to expect to be offered a coupon code etc to purchase the items at the same price as during the sale, but this is ASOS we're talking about, who have the most patronising and frustrating customer service I have ever encountered. I cannot stress enough how frustrating it is to order something for a specific date and not receive it not once, but twice. My recent order was for a wedding, where I had once again, attempted to order the shoes for this event, and received it three days too late.Can not recommend enough to not order anything late notice relying on what their delivery times are."

Worse thing is Asos is unable to change the address on the afterpay order or express orders. This is a big inconvenience for customers and surely costs money for Asos for parcels going back and then being delivered again for those who are eligible for free deliveries.  Please fix this asap."
"November 18, 2019",2,Maybe I'm done with online shopping,"Had pretty awful luck with deliveries. Three pairs of pants didn't show up. Couldn't seem to get my address right for anything. Nothing came the day it was supposed to. One pair of pants said it was in stock and then I got an email later saying it wasn't. So I ordered an different size and those never showed up. Out of maybe 6 orders, only one came and it was late. And the fit on the one that did was awful. Everything got refunded okay but that doesn't necessarily make it all better. Fedex is partially to blame but I eventually just went elsewhere for a suit eventually and had a much better experience."

"November 17, 2019",1,Awful Customer Service,Awful customer support experience.

Would not recommend this service to anyone and I would love to be reimbursed for my order. It would be greatly appreciated if my order could be cancelled.

"November 17, 2019",1,Beware of Ongoing Scam!,"hi everyone, be aware of a scam that has been going on with ASOS. After talking with a few other people I found out that I am actually not the only one this happened to. Recently I placed an order for a few items during a promotion. (If you spent over 130 you get 30 off) I spent a total of around 155 so I was eligible for the coupon. When my items arrived one of the shirts was folded inside out, had a ripped tag and stains all over the front of it. I immediately filled out the return label and sent it back. When ASOS received my item they told me they would only refund me 70 cents back. yes 70 cents... They told me that since I sent a shirt back, my spending mark was now only 129 (not 130) and therefore no longer eligible for the 30 off discount. So long story short, ASOS tells customers they are eligible for coupon codes when they spend over a certain amount. Then they send out damaged items. When you send back the damaged item, they keep the item and then take your original coupon away. This is totally fraudelent. A really bad people situation for people who are college students like myself and dont have the extra money to spare. Hope this helps, avoid ASOS if you can!"

I explained that I was videoing an unboxing for my you tube channel & Paige chatted, showing an interest, asking the name of my channel - generally being very polite & courteous whilst sorting out the replacement. She was extremely helpful & everything was done very quickly but Paige made sure that I was happy before asking me to terminate the chat. I lost the link to leave a review & as I purchase items by their reviews I contacted chat again, this time Abbie was very helpful, gave me the link, made sure that she couldn't help with anything else & again asked me to terminate the chat when I was ready. As far as customer service goes, I'd give ASOS more than 5 stars uf I could - excellent!"

I contacted Asos and Jaime was incredibly helpful and quick with my issue and can't fault them at all for their service."

"November 16, 2019",2,Disappointing system and low transparency,"Have been an ASOS customer since 2010. I can conclude that the international system/ delivery is not as good, after purchasing at least 30 times in the past. Wrong/ missing item, was told product is not available after receiving confirmation email about the order etc. Besides, some products cannot be shipped to certain countries due to contract signed between asos and the supplier (informed about this). The UK system is better than international as it allows exchange within certain time and also better packing/ logistics service.Recently I‚Äôve experienced some hassle about discount issue, which is a bit ridiculous to me since they‚Äôll take away the whole discount for the order when you return some of the items, i.e. the things you keep has none of the discount from the order you placed with discount code because of some T&Cs. This is confusing as you only know when the discount works or not when they send you back the refund which is like 2 weeks+ after you make the return then there‚Äôs no time for you to make another return if you change your mind. And sometimes discount code does not apply in some countries while it only tells you when you check out in the app."

Had a real struggle trying to get a refund once ASOS had packaged my parcel inadequately causing it to ‚Äòburst open‚Äô on the way to depot. Only after I chased for a number of days 4 days after my parcel was meant to be delivered did I learn this. I have also been told that I have to wait for all my items from the burst package to trickle back to ASOS so I can receiving my refund potentially taking up to a month. Customer service very dismissive, unhelpful and not willing to resolve. This was a large order, they keep telling me to reorder which is NOT going to happen."

"November 15, 2019",1,Unreliable delivery,"I am utterly dissapointed by the service I have received by Asos and it‚Äôs courier service. I have had to ring numerous times throughout the week for my order. Various customer service officers told me on separate occasions when I rang, that they will look into it and resolve it but I didn‚Äôt hear back from any one of them. Then when I rang Head office, a lovely lady arranged a replacement for the items I hadn‚Äôt received. However, the fact that I had to wait an extra so many days was extremely upsetting and disappointing. Taking the time out to ring asos numerous times has caused me much upset and inconvenience. That week, I had also placed another order - And again the same thing happened. It arrived another two whole days later than the estimated delivery. I was again tracking this order online. I was informed via email on the supposed day of delivery that a card has been posted by Yodel - their courier service- as apparently we were not at home. This was fabricated by the driver, as I was at home, there was no card posted and they could have left it in the shed as like every previous order. Having made numerous phone calls to asos on that day and on the following two days, I was informed that the driver couldn‚Äôt find my address. The fact that it was revealed that he couldn‚Äôt find my address, shows that he didn‚Äôt come to my house, nor did he leave a card because he couldn‚Äôt find the house in the first place. Why the driver fabricated that is beyond me. Anyhow, I made various phone calls to Asos, and nothing was getting resolved as I was getting told that it would arrive on each of those days when it fact it didn‚Äôt. Until I rang yet again on day 3, and spoke to a lovely lady who found out that they had some address issues. It finally arrived today, and I didn‚Äôt get the phone call from management as it said I would in the email update. I can only see this matter getting worse especially throughout the lead up towards Christmas. I have shopped with Asos for so many years, and the service has suddenly deteriorated, and the standards have dropped substantially. I cannot express enough how disappointed and upset I am, and I have lost my faith in this company. I truly hope other customers don‚Äôt have to go through the same at this busy time of the year."

Don‚Äôt know (and don‚Äôt care) where the T&C info is as it was not offered up during the process.Did they age discriminate?  Is their website logic flawed?  I think the answer is yes to both."

"November 15, 2019",1,I have paid for Asos' premier delivery,"I have paid for Asos' premier delivery, in order to ensure that my orders will be delivered the following day (providing I order before the deadline). On more than one occasion I have not received the delivery until a number of days later than sold to me and expected. This is simply not good enough, if I pay for premier delivery, I expect premier delivery and service. Asos has shows neither. I would understand if this was a one time thing, as every now and then things with delivery can go wrong, however this is not the case. Worse still, asos refuse to investigate further until 5/6 days have passed the agreed delivery date. I have paid for your service that promises something that it clearly can't deliver. As a paying and loyal asos customer, I am thoroughly disappointed."

I explained the situation with Renato to him but he just went on and ended the chat again.I got connected to the chat for the third time, and guess what? it's Ben again! and he just ended the chat on the spot this time.

I then received notification from Hermes that the package had been delivered to my porch (I don't have a porch), the package was nowhere to be seen and their proof of delivery was just a blue blurred image. Hermes themselves are almost impossible to get in touch with but the team at ASOS were very understanding and as we speak are looking into sending me a replacement in time for my grandma's funeral on Monday.

ASOS even agreed with the evidence I presented to this effect. ASOS took my money for next day delivery, and simply laughed all the way to the bank. They have displayed no apparent interest in the fact that they had failed to deliver on time, or that their delivery partner had fabricated a delivery attempt to avoid missing a deadline (who knows how many other people they're doing this to).With so many other options online, I'd avoid ASOS wherever possible."

I do wish they would implement a way of helping customers that received the wrong item. Let‚Äôs face it, no one likes returning something that didn‚Äôt work, but it sucks even more when it‚Äôs not your fault. I haven‚Äôt had to deal with contacting customer service too much because most of my experiences have been great. It‚Äôs hard to complain because they do provide a return label and that‚Äôs always incredibly helpful. Overall my experience with ASOS has been great, minus a few moments where I wish things would have worked in my favor.Update: I purchased an item using a 20% off code. After receiving the incorrect item, the item I ordered was out of stock. I returned the incorrect item for a refund because that‚Äôs the only option ASOS gives you. I had to ask if they would supply me with a replacement code since the error was not my fault. It would have been nice for them to give it to me as soon as I sent photos to prove the wrong item was sent, but I had request it. I was given a code the next day."

For me that policy doesn't make any sense because I'm not talking about a situation like the boots doesn't fit me well, what I'm saying is the quality I paid for and both brands claimed is not actually there.So in the end, both companies ""All Saints"" and ""Asos"" just said sorry and did nothing more to try to solve my problem which it's actually should be their problem too because they sale products claiming to be high quality and fooling the customer with pre-made answers and the customer ultimately loses because they pay a lot of money for a poor quality product.In the end we are just correct numbers, unfortunately.Sincerely,Michelle Reis."

"November 14, 2019",1,Terrible service!,"I have shopped with ASOS for years now, initially, due to it's high quality clothing, prompt delivery and excellent customer service. However, over the past few months several experiences could not have been further from this. Having a premier account means unlimited next day delivery, despite this, delivery has taken up to 7 days. An expensive branded tracksuit I ordered became frayed and damaged in several areas despite only wearing and washing the item once. When I exchanged this for another - the exact same thing happened. And most recently I was sent a completely incorrect item. I can understand ASOS staff are busy and human error can occur but when I contacted Customer Service on each occasion I can honestly say they have been the most unhelpful service I have ever dealt with. The most I have been offered is a refund of ¬£9.95 for my premier delivery since I am cancelling my account, and barely an apology. I'm not sure what has happened to their service but I will most definetely not be using them again. I am not prepared to waste my time and money on them when there are many other online fashion brands who are now offering a far better service, quality of item and usually at a lesser price."

"November 14, 2019",3,Bad experience,"647/5000I had a problem with the shopping experience that resulted in the breakout of my package. I am from Brazil, and it is very difficult to solve in a simple way that generates less damage to all involved. My problem was a collective failure, my first address disaster was out of number, I thought it was fixed, but I was informed that in the ASOS system it is necessary to completely delete the address, and re-register (it makes no sense to edit button). That way my package came from the wrong address and is returning to the country of origin. A mix of difficulties with all sectors involved. It's been a bad experience."

When I ordered my dress it told me it was going to get to me by november 14th, and I am checking my shipment and it is not suppose to get to me until november 18th which is later than I needed. When addressing this issue I was looking for a customer support number where I could call and get things straightened out but they do not have a number you can even call. You have to either tweet, facebook message, or chat them. That is not how a business should be ran, customer support-wise. There are some kinks in this company that need to be straightened out because this is just sad."

I recieved only the Top missing the Bottoms, the most important piece. Since that was the entire reason I ordered from the site. They only have a chat option for customers service. The rep Jasmine was extremely rude and I was informed I needed to return, reorder and once recieved I would be refunded. Not only was she not apologetic she rudely ended the conversation short of resolve!! That  DOES NOT help me to have to come out of pocket for an issue I did not cause. And to add to that they no longer had my size. And I found a broken fingernail in the other item I recieved. Highly disappointed!!!!!"

When I went on their chat to ask them to send the right one was told I'd have to order it again and send back the incorrect one, but I needed it the next day and wasn't prepared to have to pay postage for their mistakes. Sent the whole order back on 26th October and received an email on 5th November asking me to provide new card details for my refund as original card had expired. Added new card details that day and emailed to confirm. Response was refund processed on the 5th. Getting close to final day to expect return of my money and I just had a niggling feeling the person was referring to the original refund attempt, so messaged to check on 11th. Got a response last night, to say they have NOW issued it to the new card and they're expecting me to wait until 27th November for my refund to be received!Absolutely appalling service.They made an error, didn't even recognise or apologise for the error and are expecting me to wait yet again a full 10 working days to get my money back. Its not just a couple of quid either!I've replied to say I am raising a complaint and expect my money back by the 19th at the latest as it should have been since I added my new card on the 5th. Awaiting their response. Won't be ordering from them again."

I then was told today that I had to wait until the 14th, then in the same chat I was told that should I contact ASOS tomorrow (14th) I will be told to wait until the 15th. This is absolutely ludicrous. To top this, after contradicting herself in the chat, Francesca then ended the chat abruptly not allowing me to ask followup questions to what she had said. Especially since I had asked for the complaints procedure and for it to be reviewed by management. On another note, ASOS are unable to contact Hermes in case any of your parcels are delayed. So don't expect much help from ASOS."

It is IMPOSSIBLE to speak to someone who doesn‚Äôt just send me on in their system and actually takes care of my issue.

I asked customer service if there was any way they could send it out quicker to which they told me replacements can only be sent as the same delivery method originally chosen ? I didn‚Äôt order any replacement dresses for a start, I ordered new dresses different to the old ones. I specifically ordered with enough time to be able to send the dresses back and order new ones if necessary however this delay on people not doing their jobs properly has left it unable to do so and customer service were no help"

I received the coat but it had loads of white threads sticking out on the right sleeve so I marked it for exchange and instead I was refunded. I have checked throughout the entire time that the product was in stock and available in every size. I didn't want to order again because when I ordered the first time it was using a discount code that I can no longer use. When I got in contact with Fran using webchat (Chat ref: 23653008) I was told the only way was for me to re-order at full price and then go through the hassle of contacting ASOS again and ask for difference in discount % of that to be refunded. I then asked if I could speak to someone else who could instead generate me a discount code, I was told that nobody could and I would get the same response from everyone else and then the chat was abruptly ended on me!!!!!The very next chat I opened, I was now told by Krishna that I can get a discount code generated for me that will be sent via email. I think this is very poor and rude customer service by Fran and would like to voice my discontent. Krishna dealt with my query much better and is what I would have expected.I have yet to receive a discount code via email by the way so I'd appreciate if you could speed this up before the product actually does go out of stock."

No big deal, but would like to know where the package that shipped on October 17th is, as the last tracking record was ""shipped"". Turns out, the package is ""untrackable"" (pardon?). So, there was no help at all, just assumptions and ""hopefully your package comes by December 6th"" - 7 weeks after the order. THEN I would be eligible for a refund or replacement. An online service should be able to know where your package is. I was told nothing that I didn't already know and given absolutely no concrete answers or confirmations. The absolute most ridiculous experience I have ever had. DO NOT order from here if you are trying to buy clothes for an event because you will have no idea when you get it and neither will ASOS. Maybe save the headache, and don't order from ASOS at all."

When I did, my issue was escalated and within 2 hours I heard that the suit wasn't going to come and they refunded the whole purchase.  I contacted the team again, a little upset since I ordered the suit a month before to be prepared in case something didn't fit and i could order a new piece, and they were able to give me a discount and refund my expedited shipping cost!

I made them aware of their mistake of refunding me for the wrong item and let them know that I need to be refunded for the jacket priced at $48.Instead of simply correcting their mistake and giving me the correct refund, they decided to make this an incredibly long drawn out process for me. ASOS has contacted me and advised that they would only refund me back $21 of a jacket that costs me $48!! Their reason being is because I used a promo code that I was eligible for because my order was over $150. HOWEVER, even with sending the jacking back my order still was over $150. Not only are they trying to not give me a refund but they've been extremely slow in responding. I've been in contact with them for the past two days and am lucky to even get a response every six hours. I frequent this website quite often and make purchases on a weekly basis! I'm shocked and appalled at the their relentless inconsideration, especially from a faithful customer such as myself!!! I've boasted to many people about this website and how great they are for shopping, HOWEVER after this experience I will be receding those claims and warn all of this horrible experience with the hopes of preventing this from happening to them!!!I feel scammed and not taken seriously.

The item I ordered was on sale and I also managed to use an additional 20% discount. They have offered the discount again but as the item is off sale their mistake would cost me ¬£40!

Consultants on chat were totally unexperienced and didn't know anything. I wasted my time (+/- 1,5h) on writing messages that lead to nowhere. Finally after a couple of days they sent me an e-mail with confirmation that they sent my order (a half of it, because the rest was out of the stock..) and asked my to send back the wrong order (on my cost because they didn't sent me the return label). They made a mistake and what I got? Frozen cash, wasted time, only half of the booked order and they want me to spend cash and again time on sending back the wrong items (they did mistake, not me).  What I received in return? Nothing... That's how their customer service works and how ASOS doesn't respect its customers."

"November 12, 2019",1,Beware of discount codes and refund policies!,"Be aware when purchasing using promo codes! Because if you return items and the price drops below the required minimum spend then you lose the discount completely. Understandable, but when there are numerous other discount codes that could be applied to the total balance, after the refund, this is seems like a scam. They entice you in with discounts but if you return one item and you could just end up paying full price anyway! I spoke to someone at Asos who told me it's my choice if I want to return something and they can't retrospectively apply discount codes to new order amounts if items have been returned. Why not? Surely you are aware of your own discount codes? My amount is still eligible for a discount so why can't you apply it?? I know why... because it's an easy way to entice people in with ¬£30 off when you spend over ¬£175 (purposefully buying more clothes to get up to ¬£175) to then be stripped off any discount, paying full price for your remaining items. BEWARE ASOS DISCOUNT CODES AND RETURN POLICIES!!"

Kindly train your reps to be slight bit more empathatic to your customers as they are the one's that generate revenue and keep you afloat as a website. and company. I'm completely dissatisfied with my conversation and outcome today.
"November 12, 2019",1,I only ordered 1 product but Asos placed 4 orders for the same product without my consent,"I have actually never had any issues with Asos until now. Although I had an alright experience with Yusuf from the customer support team who asked me to give some feedback, the overall experience was really bad.First I talked the another person right before Yusuf named Mikey. He was rude, only gave standard generated answers which didn't even relate to my questions. When I asked for further explanation he just closed the chat without any heads up. Chat reference for this conversation is: 23609021The reason why I tried to contact Asos support is as follows: I tried to order a product, but experienced some technical issues as the payment service couldn't connect to the server. Therefore the payment failed and so I tried a few more times but without luck. I tried refreshing the website, closing it down and starting it up again, but nothing seemed to work. It only said the payment wasn't succesful. Then I tried to use PayPal instead of my debit card, but I had the same issue. After a short while, I realized that the order had actually been placed 3 times for the same product even though it told me the payment couldnt be processed everytime I had tried to place the order. When I contacted the support I was just told that I needed to cancel the orders myself. I told them that I tried to do this on the ""My Orders"" page before the time frame for canceling expired, but that it didn't work. I asked if I could cancel two of the orders, but I was just told to return the orders I didn't want whenever I had recieved them. Doesn't seem very fair to me that I have to pay for 2 faulty placed orders due to a failure in your system and then use my time just to send them back because ""there is nothing you can do"". The customer service is just bad joke and you get absolutely no help if you have any problems. After this I'm not sure I'm going to purchase anything from Asos again in the future."

Delivery was supposed to come on 20th October and till date (11/12) nothing arrived. What ASOS does? Clothes my account, no explanation or communication.

"November 11, 2019",1,The customer service is absolutely‚Ä¶,"The customer service is absolutely unbeliavable. My package is late and they are not even making an effort to investigate what happened to it. They have provided me with a new delivery date (I am pretty sure this was done without even contacting the delivery company) and basically told me to wait for another 10 days, as they cannot do anything about it and they are not responsible for 3rd parties. There was no explanation behind it and no desire to help at all.It is quite fascinating that in the era of Customer Experience, ASOS has not learned that they are responsible for the end to end journey of their customers and should take responsability even for the 3rd parties that they are contracting with. If a delivery is late, will reflect bad on ASOS and not on the delivery company. Will never order from them again, as the level of reliability is ZERO."

Said I could return it. More hassle over ¬£9. It was the last one left so by the time I returned it and waited an age for then to refund my gift card, it would have sold out. Can't refund the promo amount either. Not helpful at all."

Yodel advised expected delivery date as 05/11/19. Its now 11/11/19 and I still have not received a delivery. I contacted ASOS by Facebook messenger on 07/11/19 and again on 10/11/19 I‚Äôve not received any update. I‚Äôve contacted ASOS by their web chat who were helpful and arranged for a replacement parcel to be sent out.

I purchased items totally ¬£142.50 for my daughters birthday and as it was a week away I purchased the annual next day delivery to be sure they arrived in time. After 3 days the items were still showing stuck with the courier so I contacted ASOS and was told to wait 24 hours. Next day I contacted them again and they said to wait another 24 hours. Next day I contacted them again and they said they had refunded my ¬£9.95 and my goods would be moving shortly. Next day they said they would escalate to their specialist team. 1 week and 5 chat conversations later I asked to complain and was told that this was not possible as they do not have a complaints team. As an on line service I told the girl they must have a complaints process and could she tell me what it was, she said I could not complain as she was going to refund my ¬£142.50 so my problem was resolved?!! She then went into the cycle of asking me if there was anything else she could help me with - to which I kept asking to complain and eventually she just ended the chat!! Needless to say I have not had a single penny of my money refunded! This company must be regulated and its about time they were brought to task!"
"November 11, 2019",4,Kind Service after the Second try..,"Long story short, I did not receive the results I was looking for throughout my customer support experience with ASOS. Not at any fault to the consultant. They have a ridiculous policy whereby they don‚Äôt honor price adjustments. I first dealt with someone by the name of Yonis. They were very cold and completely unhelpful. They had no desire to want to help me as a customer. After a while I got patched through to Olivia who was amazingly helpful. Again, although the result was the same, she made it abundantly clear that she wanted to help me and THAT was the difference. If you ever have to deal with customer support, cross your fingers that you get Olivia!"

It does frustrate me that when dealing with customer services they come back with No‚Äôs and don‚Äôt offer solutions. I often end providing my own solution, which they are often happy to do. I don‚Äôt feel though that I should be throwing all the ideas out on how to resolve a situation.

I checked out with Klarna, it's a solution in which they help you pay in installments with no interest or upfront fees. The shipping was expected and fast. When I opened it, they did not look great on me that I was embarrassed to take a photo of myself in it. The dresses are so thin and they smelled weird. I was not satisfied. I, then, made a return note and returned it three days later. NO action was made, I contacted them days ago hoping I'll have answers. I have received no response. I tried again earlier today, and Sarah has respond. She later tells me that she passed it onto their specialist team to look into FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS?! ......And now we wait......"

Hermes have claimed they attempted delivery at a certain time despite being at home all day. No delivery was attempted at any point.

When I contacted their customer service, I was tossed around to several people who all used a very condesending tone and kept repeating same, unhelpful things over and over again. I doubt that I will shop with ASOS ever again."
"November 09, 2019",1,50/50 chance your order is right no Customer Service,"They do not enable their customer service any latitude to do any. For the third time, I received the wrong item. I was asked to return the item for a refund and re-order the items I wanted which each time was unavailable. Since they were unavailable I was told to just check back.  I do not understand why I need to 1) return the item so that that Asos can turn around and resell it, 2) spend my time and energy stalking a website to see if and when my item becomes available and 3) have no compensation in any form for my time or inconvenience. Not a coupon, a small gift card or an extension of my premier membership, nothing was offered to me when I was the one who is at the loss. I am done shopping with ASOS. At least half of the time something is wrong and nothing happens to fix it."
"November 09, 2019",4,Good customer service,Good customer service. Very patient and willing to help and take his time to find out what the problem is.

"November 09, 2019",2,I will not be ordering from this site in the future.,"I ordered shoes on 10/03/19, waited until 11/07/19 for the delivery, didn't receive the delivery. Delivery date came around and then the expected date changed to ""pending"". Confused, I followed the directions on the FedEX site to go to my ""typical U.S. Postal Service Office"" and they did not have any record of the package. I asked a rep about the whereabouts of my package and she told me that it hasn't arrived because they ""no longer sell those shoes in the U.S. anymore.""After expressing my frustration with not knowing that information after placing the order, receiving confirmation of the order, receiving a dispatch and tracking # from their shipping partner over the course of a month. I told the rep I understand she had nothing to do with the mishap, and that I wanted to know other options other than a refund. I was then told ""to be fair, you placed the order in October 3 and our stock is constantly changing week to week. They were definitely available at the time otherwise you would've been refunded right away."" To be fair, how am I supposed to know the company's policy with refunds on out of stock items, when I placed the order when they were in stock? Also, in this case I should've received the refund a while ago. I was sent a link to a page with the brand and shoes I'm assuming they sell in U.S., saw veryyyy similar shoes for the same price, asked if I could make an exchange. I was told they're unable to do that because they're two different products and codes. The rep was kind of helpful, and offered me a 15% discount on the site for future purchases, but unfortunately I won't be ordering from this site again."

I cannot fault the customer service i recieved via the online chat, Thanks Michaela!"
"November 09, 2019",1,Asos has terrible customer service,"Asos has terrible customer service. While the clothes are cheap, the service people are incredibly unhelpful and do not try to assist you outside of the bounds of their policy. When trying to change an order outside of the 15 minute cancellation period, I was told this was impossible, even though the order cut off for next day shipping was 11am the next morning. I ended up purchasing the same item in a different size and paying again for the next day shippojg prices. Furthermore, when returning the items that had come in the incorrectly ordered size, only one package returned was processed, even though they had been sent out on the same day. A terrible customer experience and I will not be using them again."

"November 09, 2019",2,Worst delivery and costumer service ever!,"For an online company, delivery should be a priority. Not for Asos though. I bough a dress for an event and asked for next day delivery. As I work business hours I asked them to deliver it to my neighbours. What I got instead was three attempts to deliver in which the courier completely ignored the fact the he could deliver it to my neighbours, even I‚Äôm being sure my neighbours were home the whole day. I got parcels from other companies in the same days with no problem. Five days later I still don‚Äôt have my parcel and gonna have to figure out other dress for my event, as this one is clearly not gonna be here on time. The worst thing is that in my attempts to talk to Asos I received the answer that nothing can be done except me traveling one hour to Gnewt (courier) depot in east London to colect it. Even funnier is the fact that Gnewt doesn‚Äôt have a phone number for contact and I have no guarantee whatsoever that my parcel will be in their depot when I go there. Asos, once more, said there‚Äôs nothing they can do about it. It‚Äôs a complete joke. Their nice clothes selection doesn‚Äôt worth all this stress and lack of respect."

I will definitely go elsewhere from now on just because others do it better.  I wanted to use a gift card someone had bought me for my birthday - in the end couldn't do it and ended up paying ¬£50 which I didn't want to.  On trying to get in touch with them to discuss, on the help page and customer service page the website automatically scrolls back up constantly so there is no way of contacting or seeing how to get help. I found out later that gift cards aren't uploaded straight away - which is weird as most people upload them when wanting to spend them.  so now I still have a gift card so have to spend more there when I don't want to.  It's a  bit crap."

Next day Delivery worked well for me but this year premium delivery just doesn‚Äôt work. No compensation for late orders are offered as well. My loyalty as a customer  is gone to zero for Asos. Some of my friends also leaving asos.Pity though, previous years we used to shop a lot with this store. Now in NL Zalando is getting better, Zalando lounge."

"November 09, 2019",1,Still not received order - poor resolution from ASOS,Ordered for next day delivery on 31st October. Despite it being with the courier it did not arrive so I contacted ASOS and was told to wait until the end on the day on the 7th Nov as next day delivery was never a guarantee. I went away without my items and just hoped it would be delivered but nothing. On the 8th I got in touch with ASOS who have said they will refund my items and if I want them I will need to re-order. Not ideal as one of the items included was a present which I ordered with plenty of time. My partners premier subscription has now lapsed and conveniently the 20% offer I benefited from has also finished so if I re-order I am being penalised more money despite none of this being my fault. It will also take 7-10 days to show in my account. I feel ASOS have not been very helpful in this situation. Why couldn‚Äôt the refund of been given immediately? I feel you knew the items weren‚Äôt going to be delivered. I think I should be given a code for the 20% off again and free next day delivery if I was to order again. ASOS have basically said here‚Äôs your money back see you later.

"November 09, 2019",1,WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!,"Honestly the worst service I have ever received I would put zero stars if possible, I placed an order for collection on 1/11 for next day delivery which would be available for collection on the 2/11. I used my premier delivery for this, I had a message to say it arrived at 21:30 on 2/11 but thought it was to late to collect so I went on the evening on the 3/11 instead, got there and they said it wasn‚Äôt there. So they decided to send me to message to cover their backs as it should‚Äôve been next day delivery an if they didn‚Äôt say it had arrived then it would look bad on them. I decided to dispute this with ASOS as it was a joke and I just wanted my refund instead. They informed me on the 5/11 that they checked and it had just been delivered that day so there was a delay and aplologised. I said I just wanted a refund as I thought this whole situation was a joke, they said I would have to wait for the package to be sent back to HO before I got this, they make a mistake and they still want me to wait... absolutely shocking! I then received a message yesterday saying that someone with a completely different name was on the parcel and they had collected it, someone that wasn‚Äôt me and I have no clue who they are collected the parceled I paid for. I checked my details and the package should‚Äôve been in my name yet they‚Äôve told me it was actually addressed to somebody else and they had taken it. I messaged back saying that that‚Äôs not acceptable and that isn‚Äôt my problem if they‚Äôve made that error and let somebody else collect it! They messaged back this morning saying that it was now out of their hands and dispute it with the person who collected it! How the hell can I do that if I don‚Äôt know the person who collected it and why have they let someone else collect it or even addressed it to somebody else anyway! Absolute joke! This was their last message: Thanks for getting back with us Steph, we're sorry that you've not received your parcel. We totally appreciate how you're feeling however as this out of our control you'll need to dispute this with the person who's collected your parcel. If there's anything else you need help with, do get back in touch and we'll be more than happy to help. Thanks again for getting in touch, please feel free to leave some feedback on TrustPilotALL YOU WANTED WAS FEEDBACK WELL HERE IT IS!"

They pass you from one person to another & in my opinion none of them have a clue what there doing as you get the same response about another member of the team looking into it for you & they'll email you to let you know why it‚Äôs late you can wait days to even get this information. By this point my delivery is usually a week or more late even at this stage none of them can explain why & they don‚Äôt offer any kind of refund for your experience why am I paying a standard delivery of ¬£3.99 for it to turn up more than a week or more late. The service here has gone down hill & will continue to do so unless they start taking there customers & there problems more seriously."

The the first time I ordered the package was delivered torn open with items missing, and taped back closed. Understandable, mistakes happen in shipping. What items I DID receive were completely see through and really poor quality. I ordered maternity leggings, and couldn‚Äôt even wear them because the material was so thin and see through. I ended up returning all the items I ordered. The second time I ordered I purchased a necklace which I received broken. In three pieces, not repairable at all. There seems to be a quality issue with the products. I will not be ordering from this site again."

"November 09, 2019",4,2 day shipping arrives 3-4 days later,I have orders from Asos many times. I have enjoyed the service in the past and have not had any issues with delivery or returns until a this weekend.  I placed an order on Sunday and on Wednesday I realized that my card had declined it thinking it was suspicious activity. I re placed my order on Wednesday hoping to get it before Sunday. I checked my schedule email today and realized my package won‚Äôt be arriving until Monday. The biggest problem is that I ordered all this clothes for my trip which I leave for on Sunday. Being that I ordered my clothes on Wednesday I was hoping that it would have come on time since I had selected the two day shipping. Now I am afraid to order anything again in the future if it is time sensitive. I don‚Äôt understand what the point of two day shipping is if it ends up being 3-4 days.

There was no discount provided if I wanted to keep the damaged item (and just repair it myself, in my situation I was very limited on time due to an upcoming engagement). Unfortunately, the item I wanted was also out of stock so I could not even try to exchange it. Customer service was alright, but seems like an unusual policy in which someone can keep a damaged item with no discount/compensation or return it and not have it. Seems against industry standard and quite unfortunate."

I contacted costumer service and asked multiple times if I could redo the transaction or repurchase the order without cancelling the shipment (as the shoes I bought were sold out and are always sold out in my size) and was met with the most unaccommodating rigid customer service I‚Äôve ever experienced. They were cold, not understanding, and refused to help me at all. This was a 10¬£ discount and they wouldn‚Äôt budge. They told me repeatedly all I could do was physically return my order, which I most likely will never find again in my size (they‚Äôve been sold out everywhere for months) and then wait to see if they ever came back in stock, and then apply the 10¬£ discount then. Every time they replied, they ignored my questions and sent their cold response ending each one stating my inquiry was over and they would not entertain other options. I felt like I was dealing with an automated system which I most likely was, because they were not replying like humans in customer service, who try to HELP the customer. This experience was not only unhelpful, but it was beyond frustrating and upsetting. 10¬£ can go a long way for a student, and to be given such a hard time about it from such a large corporation- extremely disheartening."

Actually, on their checkout page they don‚Äôt mention is at all. I understand that duty and tax are required if shipping internationally but nowhere on the checkout page (an FAQ page on the website doesn‚Äôt count, ASOS!) does it indicate that more will be charged. I had an order worth $283 and then was made to pay an additional $70 by the delivery company to receive it. I never would have ordered if I knew the amount would be so much higher. I believe ASOS intentionally hides this fact from Canadians. In the end, I will never order from them again because I feel they were disingenuous and the customer care reps were unhelpful, only directing me to the Help Centre as if I should have read that prior to ordering... Honest companies don‚Äôt hide costs from customers! Cute clothes though."

Not one person has wanted to hear my query or help in any kind of way and what makes this worse, is the fact that no one has had an answer for me. My Account has been blocked and I'm searching for answers. I raised this 2 years ago and no one has helped. When I have tried to order then off someone else's account, It was then blocked. So I have tried multiple times today to speak to someone and to no avail. I'm here, trying to give you guys money and you won't even give me the time of day. As someone who works in customer service myself, I know first hand how to handle a customers query and I give my utmost attention in trying to resolve every query I get, and if you aren't ( as a company ) willing to resolve customers queries, how do you expect people to buy from you. Like I said, I am literally here trying to give you money. I asked to speak to a manager of some sort and again... I got fobbed off. I have requested to log a formal complaint and again... all I got was a link to some random T&Cs.Ridiculous!Markell Wallace aka ""Markwell"" as I was called twice on the live chat...."

"November 08, 2019",1,Poor customer service,"I‚Äôve been using ASOS for years now and more recently they have failed to provide the customer service expected more than once. My order gets delayed (I have Asos premier) but when asked why or for information, none is given, they just tell me when I made my order (which I already know). I am never able to speak to someone of higher authority as ‚Äòall the customer agents are trained at the same level‚Äô absolute BULL! They‚Äôve refunded me the wrong order so I‚Äôve had to wait for that to come back to then pay it back. And this is just some of the issues I have with Asos! I buy from them because it‚Äôs convenient and most the items are good. But for them to keep messing up with not rectification or anything is a joke, customers aren‚Äôt able to speak to anyone but basic customer agents? Just ridiculous! I wouldn‚Äôt normally write a review good or bad but this is just getting too much now and for someone who orders every other day, i‚Äôd expect better!"
"November 08, 2019",2,I think asos need to look at the other‚Ä¶,"I think asos need to look at the other asos  review pages (go ahead and claim them) which really show how disgruntled customers are; rude and unhelpful customer service, unsuccessful delivery attempts or not even being delivered! Delay in refunds ectMy complaint is the fact they use Hermes for deliveries, I don't know if I was ever going to get my package, sadly the 'chat' with Alex from asos didn't help matters but I promptly got my refund, a shame asos don't chase Hermes for why customers are not getting their packages and just seem happy to refund and let their customers down, I wanted my items but now I'll have to shop elsewhere."

"November 08, 2019",1,will not be using this company again,It‚Äôs very disappointing to read that a lot of other customers are experiencing the same with packages when we‚Äôve paid for next day delivery especially when we need something on a certain day and it doesn‚Äôt turn or have even been notified it‚Äôs going to turn up. I won‚Äôt be ordering from ASOS again as I think it‚Äôs unacceptable to treat customers like this and not do anything about what‚Äôs happening when it‚Äôs a big company like it is.
"November 08, 2019",1,Won‚Äôt refund my money for a lost package,"Wow terrible experience. I ordered 2 large orders for a trip I had coming up in 11 days. Ordered them within an hour of each other, paid for express shipping on both. The first package arrived on time .. the next one didn‚Äôt arrive so 3 days after the expected delivery date I contacted them: they said it could have been delayed and to wait 5 more days. I contact the carrier in the mean time and they tell me it‚Äôs lost and to file a claim so I did. Contacted ASOS customer service, got the same answer that I had to wait 5 more days until they could do anything even though carrier said it was lost. I asked for a replacement order they said no. Waited the 5 days and requested a refund... they then tell me that I have to wait ANOTHER 5 DAYS. I asked why and got the same BS generic answer ‚Äúto allow for shipping delays‚Äù. Well I had already reordered the items at this point bc I needed them for my trip, express shipping and they arrived on the scheduled date... I don‚Äôt understand why they can‚Äôt admit a package is lost and refund me. Or why they were dishonest from the beginning about how long I had to wait for them to take ANY action. Very dishonest. I‚Äôve had this happen with a couple other online retailers and they send a replacement right away or offer me a refund. I‚Äôm not asking them to do something totally outrageous or unheard of. I‚Äôve worked in customer service so I understand that it‚Äôs policy from higher ups but a company should always be transparent with their polices especially when money is involved. Also let your customer service agents not only reply with the same 5 generic unhelpful answers. You guys have lost my business"

"November 08, 2019",1,Beware. Long time customer no longer!,"If I could give no stars I would. They apparently have spend and save coupons which literally mean if you return some items in the order, in the amount that no longer qualify you for the promotion, they will take the entire discount away when you get your refund and you end up getting robbed. I ordered 300.00 worth of items and used a 70.00 of 250.00 coupon. I returned nearly 100.00 worth of items and got 27.00 back due to my order no longer qualifying for the promo I used! They deducted the discount of 70.00 from my refund! How stupid is that? Unheard of. All other retailers evenly distribute the dollar amount of the discount amongst all items so when you return items, you don‚Äôt get ripped off! So unfair. Also, their customer service is rude as hell. Emma and Anthonia on live chat both cut me off and ended the chat early. They ignored questions and did not answer them correctly and showed no compassion. In fact, Emma kept repeating why I wasn‚Äôt getting an even refund, and I knew why, thought it was stupid and felt robbed so asked for an exception. She didn‚Äôt care. Anthonia didn‚Äôt even know the return policy and told me contradicting things regarding the timeframe of returns regarding another order. I was a loyal, long time customer of nearly a decade. They used to not charge sales tax for US orders too, but they do now. Also, they hike up prices on random certain brands you can get for cheap in America elsewhere. Maybe due to imports who knows. Forgot to mention there have been a couple times weeks went by after my returns were received  and I had to contact them myself for the refund. To hell with this company - I‚Äôm done and advise all to beware."

In this time one of my items went out of stock and other is currently low, so I may not get that either. This is the third (and fourth) serious issue I've had with my ASOS orders over the year. I have also paid for premier delivery which several occasions hasn't been 'next day'. I have been a loyal customer for years as they have good items in my sizing and historically have been reliable, but this is seriously making me rethink using them.

Had to email and talk to the customer service team for 30 mins only to be told this was being passed to someone else to look at. Overall one of the worst experiences I have had with ASOS. The delivery tracking service is a joke, the customer service is unhelpful and then to have only 1 item delivered out of 3 with no explanation why they did not deliver the other 2 items is unacceptable."
"November 07, 2019",1,It‚Äôs no surprise ASOS are at a loss,"It‚Äôs no surprise that ASOS are making a financial loss every year. They have poor customer service and the quality of their own brand is poor. I‚Äôve been shopping with them since 2010 but merely remained an ASOS Premier customer due to convenience.My next day delivery parcels are either always delayed; my orders are frequently missing items; the quality is so poor that items usually damage after one wear or wash. To be honest, I would advise spending your money elsewhere unless you‚Äôre buying non-asos brand clothing.Now, I use their app to find clothing from other brands and opt for buying directly. After waiting over a week for parcels I never received, I realise that ASOS doesn‚Äôt value or respect customers and I‚Äôve decided to close my account.I wouldn‚Äôt recommend shopping with ASOS. Go for brands with better customer service because it makes all the difference; their delivery subscriptions are also a third of the price of ASOS and actually work in that you receive your items the next day as promised. Other retailers are now trumping asos and it‚Äôs clear to see why. They‚Äôve lost a long term customer, though I doubt they care."

Waited in for delivery. Hermes the courier claimed to have said they left a calling card, they didn‚Äôt, they didn‚Äôt even attempt delivery. I contacted ASOS, who weren‚Äôt helpful told me because I ordered Thursday night I wouldn‚Äôt get my order until Monday, which isn‚Äôt what communication I had previously from both ASOS and Hermes. Waited in Monday no delivery again!! Now tracking states problem with address!! Funnily enough  I ordered another item from another retailer and it was delivered by Hermes?!? I just don‚Äôt get the problem with ASOS/Hermes delivery. Now been told it will be delivered before Friday!!! Over a week!! Great service for premier delivery!!!! Another waste of money. No refund offered. Worst service ever"

"November 06, 2019",1,Wow! Deceptive practices and extremely poor customer service!,"Wow. I have never experienced such poor customer service! After returning an item I noticed that the amount I was being refunded did not match the amount I originally paid. In chatting online with a customer service agent named Leighann, I was told that it was the original shipping charge. On the email sent after they received the return it even showed the original shipping charge as $0.00. However, when I then looked closer at the amounts, I could see that they did not add up. Here is a copy and paste from that email:Original order value:Subtotal: 42.00 USDShipping: 0.00 USDDiscount: -6.30 USDSales tax: 3.37 USDTotal: 44.06 USDThose charges shown actually add up to $39.07, not the $44.06 they actually charged me. Although they claimed that shipping was free, they had secretly added on $4.99. At the time I just simply paid for the transaction, not realizing the discrepancy. Leighann said that it stated on the web site that you would be charged shipping if the total was less that $50, and thus the shipping charge. I would have been fine with that if that is what they actually showed me on my invoice, and I was expecting to pay a shipping charge. I feel like I should only be expected to pay what they stated I would be paying. Since this was an error on their part, not mine, I asked her to please issue a full refund. She refused and told me I needed to pay better attention in the future to my order totals and call them if there was something inaccurate. What?!? It's my job to keep your company honest and find your errors? That is ridiculous. I will not be doing business with this company in the future, and would highly discourage anyone else from doing business with them as well.It is not the few extra dollars that I am out that really matters to me, it is the fact that THE COMPANY DOES DECEPTIVE THINGS AND TREATS THEIR CUSTOMERS VERY POORLY that has lost them my business. If you do choose to do business with them, BEWARE OF HIDDEN COSTS AND INCORRECT INVOICES!"

Yet another company that couldn‚Äôt care less about the customers who keep them in business. Shocking. Will be escalating this futher"
"November 06, 2019",1,Not reccomended,"I made a mistake on my Asos order and I literally had to have the same conversation with 4 different Asos customer advisers to get it rectified. I noticed the error I made as soon as I received my delivery notification from Hermes (who I would rate 0stars for customer service if I could, they make it almost impossible to contact them and if you purchase from a retailer they will not let you speak to an advisor on any sort of chat or telephone service) Anyway back to Asos, they are a bit useless and so am I so let's hope my parcel makes its way to me eventually. The advisor I finally  got through to on the Asos customer service chat assured me she had fixed my mistake for me but it's gonna take until the 13/11 at least of my parcel that was originally to be delivered on the 29/10 and I have been trying to chase since 28/10 to get here. I have been emailing back and forth with Asos from 28/10 until 6/11 and have all they have done is repeatedly advised me to contact Hermes and/or change my details on Asos, both of which I had clearly stated that I had already done."

Last week I received an email reminding me that my payment date was coming up (which it shouldnt be because it was returned) So I contacted ASOS to get them to rectify this and have my account updated to which they have been nothing but useless and doing nothing that helps the situation. They are now asking for a copy of the receipt which I don't have anymore because it was 4 weeks ago. They haven't given me and resolutions the only thing they have done is pass it to one another and said it's not their responsibility. Nothing but cheek and uselessness !!!!

The first time, customer service refused to help me apply a coupon code minutes after I had submitted my order, stating that they could make no changes to orders.  The only reason it was too late to apply the coupon code was because it had taken them over 15 minutes to reply to my online chat and, because I had requested expedited shipping, I only had 15 minutes to cancel my order (unbeknownst to me).  While talking to customer service, the rep was combative and unfriendly and literally told me ""whatever helps you sleep at night"" when I mentioned that I'd review the company negatively.  All I wanted to do was cancel the order at that point.  I have never experienced such poor customer service anywhere before.  The second time, I returned an item and received a confusing breakdown of fees.  The customer service rep was at least nice and explained why I was only being refunded a certain amount, but none of the random fees she mentioned to me had been listed in the breakdown emailed to me.  The company is sketchy and difficult to deal with.  Do yourself a favor and just avoid them."

It's impossible to talk on the phone or to speak to a supervisor. The reps are scripted and are absolutely NOT interested in helping out individual customers, regardless of the circumstances. They are there to tick the box of customer service without providing any. Other companies do more business and provide better service by leaps and bounds, so I'll be spending my money there."

HOWEVER, once products are added and ready to check out, it indicate that the products are not able to ship to selected ""SHOP IN"" country. I have wrote in to ASOS support and came to understand that there is a distribution contract in place thus, not able to ship the products.Support experience:1. Support takes way too long to reply and was not able to understand what issue I was facing.  2. Support staff did not even find out which platform I was having issues with.3. Multiple support channel to raise queries or issues, which is great.  However, replies were equally slow.Interesting fact I noted:1. Product shipping restriction not indicated on mobile app but indicate only on website online store2. Products not available to ship was listed in the product category for customers to select and add to cart, only to realize product cannot be ship at check out. Suggestion for improvements:1. Choose to list the products that cannot be shipped in ""SHOP IN"" country What you can help customers:***Indicate product restriction within the ASOS mobile app if products do not delivered in the selected ""SHOP IN"" country***OR2. Remove products that are not available for shipping in the respective selected ""SHOP IN"" country.3. Have a better support chat apps within the mobile app or be more responsive in replying to query raised.On a last note, I do understand that the issue only relates to certain products that ASOS has a distribution contract with. ASOS offers a huge variety of products for consumers to choose from.  Reasonable minimum spend for free shipping and free returns.All the above are great.However, support for customer (before or after) is as crucial as products offering."

Aasha just kept sending pre written policies to me for answers even though I kept asking directly why did I get custom charges this particular time. I‚Äôve never had that happen to me with my multiple purchases from ASOS from the past year and a half. Thanks Jae for giving me precise and much more personal help for my particular case. I was going to stop ordering from ASOS all together cause I was afraid I‚Äôd keep getting huge custom charges that would make it unaffordable. Now, I‚Äôll just keep my orders below a $100 CAD like in the past in order to most likely avoid a $71 customs order charge on $165 of purchased goods. OUTRAGEOUS.

When I went to reorder, you were out of my size and the discount code was no longer available.""FFS... Nightmare."" - Hayden, a good looking, but disgruntled customer.The experience I had with Tom, however, was refreshing and he showed a lot of empathy. He seemed like he actual gave a **** about the situation and the inconvenience caused, even though he was probably working on 5 streams of complaints at the same time and also curating his Instagram (possibly not, but I 100% would have been). Talking to a genuine person and not a scripted robot that fails to deal with complaints and has no wiggle room to rectify issues that the business has caused for its customers, is what will bring me back to ASOS, even after I swore off online shopping through similar retailers, for similar issues in the past. I'm pretty chill and I know that Tom wasn't the individual that made the initial mistake (and to whoever that person was... I forgive you, **** happens), but his service and bant made my day. If I wasn't half a world away, I'd buy him a beer (or a wine/gin & tonic/vodka soda/maybe a spritz [weather permitting] - because your drink of choice is not an indicator of your masc/femininity). BUT alas, I prefer the Sydney climate so I can not personally thank him with a cheeky bev. So I put it to you... give him a raise... a promotion... a recognition trip to vegas... or a solid high-five at the very least cause he made the experience worthwhile and resolved my issue. I'd vote for him even if he was leading a pro-Brexit party, regardless of my own personal and very limited views on the topic. #TomForPresident11/10 would recommend. Tom is a tank!"

But everytime I have the need to use the customer service it is that awful I stop using ASOS completely as a result, time passes I give it another shot and then I remember all over again how horrendous their customer service is so here's my review. Just recently I ordered some last minute holiday clothes, order went through, went about my day and I get an email from ASOS several hours later saying there was a problem with my promo code used so they cancelled the entire order. This promo code was an active code and was accepted at the time of order and only applied to one item giving me just ¬£1.50 off. Every single item then went out of stock which meant I couldn't even reorder and had no holiday clothes. I have spent literally thousands upon thousands with ASOS and they cancel my entire order for the sake of ¬£1.50. They didn't even bother responding to my message either. The next day delivery was once a USP but with everyone doing this now there's no need to put up with their horrendous quality, odd fitting clothes and awful customer service.. Bye ASOS."

"November 04, 2019",1,ASOS -WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!,"ASOS delivery is normally very good, but this time it was delayed (which is fine, they don't always have control of carrier delays). My problem is more to be with the terrible customer service. I chatted in THREE times to ask about why my shipment is delayed and when to expect it. The first two times they told me FedEx is wrong in saying it will be 3 days delayed - saying that on their ""system"" it still says the original delivery date, which is when I needed this package. On the FedEx website, the delivery date kept getting pushed back, which is why I chatted in a second time to make sure. They assured me it would still make it on time and that they can't help me with anything else unless the package does arrive late, and to contact them again.Fast forward, the package never arrived the day they promised. I chatted in for the 3rd time, and this was the worst chat ever. The person told me to allow until November 12th for the package to arrive. The original delivery date was November 1st. I placed the order on October 23rd! I was outraged. No apology, nothing. All they said was to contact them again if I don't get it by November 12th. Mind you, my credit card has already been charged $191. TERRIBLE customer service, so unhelpful. I even asked for a manager to contact me to explain this situation and how this shipment could be SO delayed. The customer service rep said he will NOT be transferring me to a manager and then ended the chat on me....SO infuriating. ASOS, I would give you ZERO stars if I could, but 1 star was the lowest rating I could give."

A couple of days later I receive an email saying that ASOS have issued me a refund.Confused I emailed customer service again to ask why this was done and I was told that the item was out of stock at the time so a refund was issued however this was not true as I had kept an eye on the item page and the size was always in stock.After this I reordered the boots and they arrived today, as soon as I opened them my stomach dropped, I recognised the way the boots were packed as I had packed them and surprise surprise they were the EXACT boots I had sent back and marked as faulty so they clearly weren‚Äôt checked and just put back in the stockroom! I am absolutely fuming and I‚Äôm waiting to hear back from customer service however they seem to be taking their time.ASOS will be losing a loyal customer of many years."

"November 04, 2019",1,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER,"Shipped me one of my six items. Unacceptable. When asked up this, they agreed to ship me my missing items with free priority shipping, but told me some of the items were now out of stock. So while I was waiting thinking I had an item coming to me, they were being sold and shipped to other people. WAIT, IT GETS WORSE. When refunding me, they took the discount code I used and subtracted it from my order. I used a discount code for $70 off $273 (about 25%). Instead of figuring the adjusted price of each item, they refunded me $24.92 for items that cost me $66 ($89x.75). So now, because they failed to send me my items and sold them to other people, the price of all of my other items significantly increased. They failed to see the issue I had with this and understand my position. THEN, I GO TO THEIR WEBSITE AND FIND THAT THE TWO ITEMS ARE ACTUALLY STILL IN STOCK IN MY SIZE. Because they already refunded me, they claim they can‚Äôt just send them to me but a $25 loss on their end seems fair for the amount of time they have wasted. Even better, they refuse to give me a discount that brings the two items to $24.92, the same amount I was refunded. So it becomes significantly cheaper to wait for my replacements to come, ship them all back, and then reorder and hope everything comes this time... Doesn‚Äôt seem like the correct way to handle the situation that they messed up. EASILY THE WORST CUSTOMER CARE EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD. WOULD RATE 0 STARS IF POSSIBLE.."

My package was due to arrive on 11 October and now on 4 November ASOS has no idea where it is. There is no option to track the parcel once it is in the country of delivery for some countries. They do not warn you about this, so be careful yourself. I had to buy another dress in a store so I spent a lot more money than I wanted to. Also, to return the package you have to bear the shipping expenses, so just a lot of money lost."
"November 04, 2019",1,What awful customer service,What awful customer service. Asos have unconvinced me twice over my money. and all they can do is ending the chat without any resolution. Will be going to OMBUDSMAN.  Refunded MY money to a card which isn't even in MY name!! Surely that isn't legal!

When it's right - they're doing the job we pay them for and nothing more. When they get it wrong and you ask for help the advice is consistently arrogant and inflexible. Your value as a customer has no meaning to them or their processes. I use ASOS for convenience (when it works) but I'm left once again wondering why I bother giving them more money. Don't expect them to put it right if they mess up or care in any way. Deliveries can be late, missing items, cancelled, it does not matter to them. I've been trying since ordering last night to get my issue resolved and it resulted in me being linked to a help page and being hung up on because ""Corrina"" couldn't escalate it beyond giving me a link. Insane."
"November 04, 2019",2,Please change from Fastway Couriers!!,"Asos themselves are excellent, but I had to deduce 3 stars because of the courier they have chosen to work with in Ireland. Fastway Couriers have continuously provided a horrific service. They are ridiculed nationally for their lack of competence. This is completely justified! They have lost/ mis-delivered parcels of mine and they simply do not reply or any emails. Would absolutely love it if Asos changed their partner courier. Then I could order safe in the knowledge that I would actually received my parcel. Many other company‚Äôs like Zara have (thankfully) changed from Fastway to the national postage service in Ireland, An Post. Hopefully Asos will improve their service by getting a reliable courier. Asos and their customer service is wonderful. So quick and really friendly and helpful. 5 starts for ASOS. Minus stars for the courier!"

I did not receive money back after this time and after 3 weeks I contact with Asos again and they promised the same , to wait up to 10 days.

They have also totally disregarded the fact that the offer was staggered when you spent different amounts and havent even considered that I would still be eligible for other offers. Its basically theft and completely unacceptable!!

I received a text on the 31st of October to say the package would be delivered between 8 am-6 pm that day, it did not. I went online to track my delivery but when I entered the details I was told that the delivery service did not have any info about where my package was. I then contacted ASOS online who told me that I had to wait until the delivery time was up and was still not given a reason to where my package was. I also received another text on the day to say the package would be delivered between 8 am-6 pm, it did not. I messaged ASOS that evening through facebook who said the delivery people 'could not access the premises' and that there was no one there to receive it even though three separate people were in the address during both of those dates and we do not live in a gated community and on the street. I contacted ASOS again on Saturday morning asking for a full refund, it's now Monday the 4th and I still have not received my delivery nor been given a reason to why it's not been delivered. There seems to be a bad breakdown in communication between the delivery services and ASOS as they told me they have to wait to see where my delivery is until I could receive a refund. This is unacceptable and I will not be using ASOS in the future after this experience."

I made an order in September, it has not arrived yet and after multiple attempts to contact their customer support via email, I have been asked to wait another several weeks, and given the run around with the same generic email response 5 times. They do not employ real customer service agents and use an automatic computer generated responses instead, simply to waste your time. At this point I simply want a cancellation of my order and a refund, which they refuse to issue and have asked me to wait another several weeks. This company will not take responsibility for failing to deliver orders. Despite what it says on their website, they will not refund you and their international shipping is extremely unreliable. My order was almost $300. Do not order from this retailer, they are a scam."

Contacted asos via online chat only to be told they can‚Äôt do anything (literally). I can contact them tomorrow if I don‚Äôt get the package by the end of the day(I won‚Äôt, I know this delivery company and they can‚Äôt do I thing right). Asked to cancel the order and pass- no can‚Äôt do. Asked for complaint procedure? They don‚Äôt have one. Complaint via chat and asked for reference or confirmation? They don‚Äôt follow up on complaints. Contact hermes to contact the driver? No because they don‚Äôt work for hermes. Now I have to wait 7 wd for the package to be returned to them (because I won‚Äôt be home for the next 2 days when hermes will attempt their delivery again) and another 7-10 wd for refund, meaning I won‚Äôt get money for something I won‚Äôt receive for another 3 weeks.

On Sunday I seen a courier delivering an ASOS package to my neighbour. I asked if he had mine and he said he was just a Sunday delivery driver. I spoke to my neighbour who told me they had ordered on Saturday and had just had their item delivered.So I go on ASOS chat who quote me a standard paragraph about delivery best endeavours - then said have a lovely day when I said I wasn‚Äôt happy (Maddison).Complete joke! You use ASOS for quick last minute items and I‚Äôm paying for a service I have not received. Be aware!
"November 03, 2019",5,Asos - great. DPD - not so much,"Can't fault Asos at all. Their service is great, as well as their products and quick deliveries. My only issue is with DPD. Was waiting for a parcel this morning and stayed home, knowing it was due within the 1-hour time slot. Received a notification from Asos saying the parcel had been delivered and signed for by someone with my surname. Assumed it had been left in one of the bins by my back gate, but it wasn't and received no calling-card from them either.Eventually went and spoke with one of the neighbours, luckily she had accepted it and would you know it, the DPD driver had left the calling-card with the neighbour (which had ""back gate"" written on it).No fault on Asos' part, but if DPD could actually 1. Learn how to knock a door/ring a doorbell and 2. Wait more than 3 seconds for someone to answer their door (experienced this on several occasions), they wouldn't get such a bad reputation as couriers!"

Also they have no phone number to contact Hermes? Before I rang up, I tweeted them and also sent them a direct message on Facebook querying where it was. It took them more than 24 hours to get back to me. In which time I had already received the package and already spoken to someone on the phone. I normally have no issues what so ever from ordering with ASOS because they use DPD over Hermes. I‚Äôm afraid that if next time my courier is Hermes, I will not be shopping at ASOS again."

The dress I ordered was cute, and I would have loved to wear it if the zipper hadn‚Äôt been broken. But first, the courier ASOS used claimed they couldn‚Äôt deliver my package. I haven‚Äôt had shipping issues to my apartment building, but the courier said ASOS hadn‚Äôt shared the full shipping and billing information. ASOS said that wasn‚Äôt true, but ASOS refused to contact the courier that they contracted with, so I was left scrambling to find a shipping solution. Once I finally did track down my package (after at least 4 hours of trying), the zipper on the dress I had ordered was broken and would only zip half way. I contacted ASOS and was told they couldn‚Äôt send me a replacement. ASOS told me that my only option was to order another dress, pay for it and shipping again, and hope the courier would actually deliver it this time. ASOS customer service has a LONG way to go and leaves me with no confidence that ASOS would perform any better on another order. Don‚Äôt waste your time and money on ASOS."

In short I was advised - sorry about that... you can expect to receive it by the 11th Nov. 10 days after it was meant to be delivered and left me outfit-less for my event. Overall customer experience with ASOS has been poor, no compensation was provided. They are very out of line with a number of other competitors in the market who do everything to ensure they maintain customer satisfaction. I won't be using this service again."

The slit is down the centre where in the photo it is on the side of the dress. Overall, the dress looks like a robe and I would not recommend ordering from ASOS. You won‚Äôt even get your full money back with all the duties that you have to pay. Beyond disappointed!"

It would be great if they used all cardboard boxes. Also they need to stop using hermes as the delivery service as they are rubbish. Always late and never send the right information. DPD are much better.
"November 01, 2019",1,Where do I begin,"Where do I begin? 2 out of 18 items in my order were missing. Based on other reviews, it seems to be a common practice for Asos. I wish I knew. I got refunded for two incorrect items, of course cheaper than the ones that were missing. Took almost a week of back and forth conversations with Customer Care team to adjust the difference. Then I decided to return the items that didn't fit me and go figure ..of course getting less money than expected because somehow 1 item was already mistakenly marked as refunded. So mad! Customer service is less than helpful, seems like they serve there to confuse customers even more and cheat them on the return money. They are pretty quick to respond though ..I give them that ...but absolutely helpless and not listening. Will never shop here again because of the fear dealing with the 'Customer care' team."

I have had delivery issues numerous times where next day delivery and instant never arrives on time and I have to wait as long as standard delivery , sometimes I don‚Äôt even get it at all. Asos blame it on the courier service but seeing as they are the ones charging extra for delivery options initially it should be their responsibility . So disappointed don‚Äôt think i would ever order from here if I need anything next day or instant as there is a very high chance it will not arrive on said day"

I have pictures to prove this upon my arrival to my flat. Is this something that is OK with ASOS?I had waited in all day for the parcel to arrive, because it was due, I pay an annual subscription for next day delivery and followed the rules regarding ordering early enough. So when my parcel is not here on time, arrives days later, a delivery service thinking it is acceptable to sign for it themselves and then just dump it on my doorstep; I think is a pretty unacceptable and disgraceful.How will ASOS be dealing with this?Kind regards,Lauren"

After stating that I didn't have the tracking ID because I forgot to write it down from the provided return label, she told me to contact them again with the tracking id if i had additional questions....that was my question. I'm not sure how UPS will be able to find my package if I have literally zero information besides the address for my house?...but that is my next step. It's been about 10 days since I shipped."

Contacted customer care and they informed me that I must allow until the 6th November for my order to arrive. Which is just ridiculous.

I left a 5 star review bc even tho I was rude, and frustrating to deal with Monaliza was unbothered and she remained profession through the entire process. To make it more clear I spent about 30-45 minutes dealing with the other 4-5 people, Monaliza spent an hour with me doing everything she could to fix the issue, she did such a wonderful job and she eventually took care of the problem. Dealing with certain companies, especially those that are over seas, can be difficult. I want to thank Monaliza for restoring my faith in this clothing company. She needs a promotion and a raise. Thank you again Monaliza!!"

"November 01, 2019",1,Advice: place your order for the summer in winter and vice versa!,"The saying if something is too good to be true it probably is most definitely comes to mind when thinking of Asos. Although the prices are amazing, do not bank on efficient and quick delivery. I have placed 2 orders in the last 3 weeks and on both cases they took at over 5 days to deliver (we are in 2019, not the stone ages!). My friend paid for next day delivery on another instance and surprise surprise it did not arrive. In conclusion, if you need something for a special occasion on a specific date, it really is not worth relying on ASOS as all you will receive is disappointment and when you take this up with customer service the only response will be along the lines of getting back in touch with them at a later date."

I‚Äôve been shopping with Asos for over 12 years and god knows how much I‚Äôve spent. But something has changed in the last 12 months. Items go missing. Orders cancelled with no reason or notification. Attempts to speak with customer service for basic information such as status of a refund or help with a label when their site is down met with sheer rudeness. There is no hint of customer focus - practically every interaction I‚Äôve had has led me nowhere but more than anything to be spoken to disrespectfully with zero interest in addressing any concerns is a joke. Having spent tens of thousands of dollars over the years - I will literally never shop with Asos again. Completely lost their way. Go to iconic instead.

I sent an email 4 days ago and still no response!!!!  ASOS are getting worse and worse.  I request a refund to be told the specialist team is looking into it. I will be contacting AfterPay and my banking instituton if this isn't resloved in 24 hours.  Its unfortunate they have great products BUT THE MOST PATHETIC CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!

Was hoping customer service would be understanding and help me with a solution to overnight me something else, but you guys don't offer that to my area.

"October 31, 2019",2,My ASOS Experience,"Placed an order with ASOS this was my experience: -The order status: Upon looking up the tracking was off (had to contact CSR-chat). The only reassurance given from the CSR was his statement to not follow the tracking info. -The order was received on time, unfortunately, it did not suit me. -Return: filled out the form as per instructions and shipped out; No email was received by ASOS confirming once returned package was received (I checked spam folder) nor that the return was in the process stages, nothing was noted on the website under MY ACCOUNT either; Contacted CSR-chat, wait time was lengthy given the breakdown and info given, however, CSR rep Elysha was helpful and confirmed return received, refund sent, etc. Overall, I expected more from ASOS as far as the accuracy of tracking information and up to date information via email and on website/account. As a first-time customer making a purchase (that I was in need of for a very special event with a short window to purchase) was less than ideal."

Alas, no refund and consequently, the last purchase from me."

They do NOT distribute the discount across the order, in my experience, as every other online merchant I have dealt with does. This feels like an arm twist to force you to keep your entire order, even though they tout easy returns. The pair of shoes I purchased and returned were shockingly cheaply made, but of course styled to look fabulous in their photo. When I returned the cheap shoes, they deducted my entire order discount from the shoes, resulting in  zero refund. I should've just dropped to them in the trash - it would have been less hassle than returning them.  Shop at your own risk - you have been warned!"

"October 31, 2019",1,NEVER buy Asos shoes!!!,"NEVER buy Asos shoes besides the good reviews that you are seeing. I bought a pair of heeled ‚Äúsock‚Äù boots and they are awful. I bought them a month ago. They are pretty and everything. I had to sell the first pair because the eu sizing doesn‚Äôt match the uk one, but whatever, i bought them again one size up. So the first time i wore them, the heeltap blunted in a strange way, like it was almost falling. Second time i wore them, the heeltap realli fell this time. I went to a shoes-repairing guy and replaced my heels. But guess what, they fell AGAIN! So this time i went againg and he replaced the heel taps with something really good. The heel taps didn‚Äôt blunt this time, but MY WHOLE HEEL BROKE FROM THE MIDDLE. The boots are gorgeous, but the quality...... no thank you."

I got a faulty piece with scratches on it!! When I spoke to their chat service personnel - it seemed like he was in a hurry to just end the chat and not really help. I got what looked like automated responses concerning the return and refund policy - but nothing that could convince me to place an order with them again.  Well, first impression is last impression. Sad! I hope ASOS team looks into it."

"October 31, 2019",1,ASOS premier ‚ÄòScam‚Äô for multiple orders in a short timeframe.,"Normally I would give ASOS a decent review as usually the service I received was good. However after renewing my premier delivery for another year I then placed an order shortly after this one and got stung with a next day delivery charge. Obviously this is not what any premier member of multiple years would want, so I contacted customer services to see what they would do, as I am a student and therefore do not have a large source of income. And after paying ¬£10 for premier on the first order and ¬£5.95 on the second order for next day delivery, customer services told me that they could not refund the ¬£5.95 due to premier taking up to an hour to activate, which was a fact not stated when adding premier to the basket but is hidden away in the help section. The customer service adviser who I spoke to was keep to help as first however after giving them the order numbers they continued to state that they will not refund as it states in the help section. But I‚Äôm pretty confident I speak for a large group of premier members when I say that nobody goes hunting through the help section to make sure they don‚Äôt get stung by repetitive charges.As a member of multiple years, I feel a bit disappointed that a large company like ASOS has very little respect for its student customers who not only show loyalty by renewing premier every year but who also spend a decent amount of money on their website."

"October 31, 2019",1,Disappointing First and Last Experience,"I ordered a suit jacket and matching pants Sunday specifically for a wedding on Friday.  On Wednesday night, I received the package.  To my shock, when I opened the package it was missing the jacket.  I checked my emails and no where did I receive an email stating that the items were being sent separately. When I reached out to customer care, they informed me that the suit jacket was out of stock when they shipped it and that they informed me of it and gave me a refund.  After searching through my inbox, I found a message that was sent on Tuesday while I was at work with the subject ""care"" without any mention of my order number or Asos branding on it.  This was in fact the email notifying me of my refund.  The customer care rep, Waqar, seemed pretty apathetic and responded that I can try checking back in the Asos ""Back-in stock"" page.  Not only am I annoyed that I was burned on my first time using Asos, I will never use Asos again and I will tell friends and family not to use Asos in the future.The fact that I wasn't presented with any other solution than ""better luck next time"" really sucks.  You have lost a customer for life."

Plus, if the item has been handed over to a neighbour, before doing so, could the delivery person please text the buyer of where and which person he gave the item to? For instance I have 3 neighbours, of which 2 of them are completely reclusive and uninteractive. Hence I would would very much rather if I'm notified in advance, rather than knocking on everybody's doors one by one."

"October 29, 2019",1,they have the worst customer service,"they have the worst customer service. You can never resolve a problem. And they work with FedEx which always loses packages and never takes responsibility. After losing almost $500 to ASOS and never being happy about a purchase, I stopped shopping from them. Irresponsible, tacky and greedy company."
"October 29, 2019",1,"Terrible customer service, sent clearly worn items","Terrible service. After years of ordering and never having a problem with items, delivery or returns I have found the service surrounding my latest order awful. I have been clearly sent someone‚Äôs returned coat- buttons missing (no replacements anywhere on the labels etc as you‚Äôd usually find), frayed stitching, worn patches where someone has sat in it a few times, and animal hair. Having not got the time to be able to wait for a replacement (it‚Äôs cold, I want to wear my coat tomorrow) I‚Äôm told I have two choices: return for a refund or exchange, or put up with the Awful state the item has arrived in-in not so many words. The three (so far) advisors I‚Äôve had contact with can‚Äôt even refer to me by my name, stating they‚Äôre trained to the same level as their managers but call customers by their colleagues names and do not even read the extent of the complaints surrounding one order. What an utter joke! No wonder they‚Äôre now in financial difficulties. Or perhaps this utter lack of customer service is from making cut backs, who knows! After bulldog clip fiasco it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me."
"October 29, 2019",1,Useless delivery partnership with Hermes,"ASOS seem to have switched to Hermes as their delivery service in my area. Hermes are so useless and unreliable that I won't be shopping at ASOS any more. Deliveries are often 3-4 days late, if arriving at all. I'm not sure why they don't use DPD anymore?Getting in touch with ASOS customer service is also a waste of time as their responses are generic, insincere and unhelpful. I'll be shopping elsewhere now."
"October 29, 2019",1,Substandard customer service,"I love asos but the minuet anything goes wrong the customer service teams are completely unable to deviate from their useless processes. Every email you get from them is a generic customer service response, usually saying they hope they have resolved your issue. When in actual fact they have done nothing to solve your issue and don't intend to. It's completely unfair that a company of this size are not remotely interested in taking care of their customers. I also think it is extremely patronising to ask if they have been able to help or when they haven't done anything helpful. Also they use hermes and everyone knows hermes are unreliable! I had an issue with delivery. I can't communicate with the courier because their contact forms recognise I'm a asos customer so direct me back to hermes. When I then contact ASOS they told me they cannot contact hermes because their contract doesn't allow these. Therefore any issues with delivery can NEVER be resolved. I now have to wait up to a month for a refund and by that time the stuff I ordered will be out of stock. Further to this earlier this month I ordered a dress but was sent the wrong dress. A return wasn't enough because I had ordered the dress for an occasion. Customer service said sorry  üòÇ"
"October 29, 2019",1,Next day delivery doesn't mean it will‚Ä¶,"Next day delivery doesn't mean it will get there the next day. Don't be fooled into paying for the years free unlimited next day delivery. When this goes wrong for whatever reason, you're left getting your items at an inconvenient time and ASOS accept no responsibility.I've used this service twice and it's only come on time (the next day) once. Not worth it at all."

"October 29, 2019",3,Mistakes are not allowed...,"Fair prices, wide range of products and fast delivery but please be careful. Don‚Äôt make any mistake or change mind because after some minutes you place an order you can‚Äôt change anything even when they didn‚Äôt send your package yet. They insist to send you the wrong item than change size or fit of it. So you have to send it back and reorder."
"October 29, 2019",5,The Best Online Shop,"I love Asos, I love Premier Delivery, I love their product selection, Sales and variety of Payment Methods too. I have never had any problems with orders or payments and not even many courier problems either (which is not Asos fault anyway!) Thanks God for Asos!"
"October 29, 2019",1,Poor Handling of Premiere Delivery,"I placed an order for just about $250 and elected for 2-day shipping. I pay for the Premiere Delivery service, which is $19 annually for unlimited 2-day shipping. The order was split in two packages; one was delivered a day early and the second tracking number was flagged with a delay. I waited two additional days (one being a Sunday) before contacting ASOS for a solution. The first agent I spoke with talked to me via a chat box for 20 minutes and offered no solution. She said the expected delivery date was the same day I was calling, and they were not able to ""do anything"" in the system until the following day. I told her that I was talking to her well after UPS delivery hours and there was no chance of it being delivered. In fact, there had been no updates to the tracking number for two days. It was lost. I stopped talking with the agent and called UPS instead. UPS advised that I can pick up the package the following morning at a Customer Center. I go to the location and am told the package is lost by the UPS employee. I open an investigation with UPS and then contact ASOS again for a solution. After 15 minutes of circling around, I'm told the only thing I can do is wait another 7 business days to see if the order arrives. The agents I spoke with were friendly, but completely unable to be helpful because of the restrictions placed on them by their Customer Care policies. There was no alternative solution, no options to reorder and be refunded an overnight cost, nothing. In fact, ASOS was running a 20% sale on EVERYTHING which would completely cover the cost of overnight shipping for the item I purchased. The agent didn't mention anything, simply continued to say the same thing over and over and reassure me that ""this was the correct process."" ASOS has shown me that are really, really anti-consumer and they have a Customer Care team that clearly are unable to do anything to assist you in unique circumstances. There was no option to escalate and I couldn't speak with anyone on the phone. I had to place an overnight order to get my package in time. Here's hoping it's actually delivered."

There was a mix up with my return, which got complicated as I was trying to find the right size in something, and she was extremely quick to solve my problem!

She left a bad taste in my mouth at that time. I was actually going to compliment Paige on her kindness this time. It seems like she well knows how to treat customers in a good way.

So my partner worn it once, put it in the wash with 3 other Hugo boss shirts and the one from ASOS shrank!!! Told them I wanted to return it and they told me I would get a full refund, marked it as faulty on the sheet and it also said on the return sheet I had up to 45 days to return, instead they send me a gift voucher and it wasn‚Äôt mentioned on my return sheet!! Been speaking to Charlotte today and she told me I had marked my return down as ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt suit me‚Äù which I never as I had wrote on the has shrank in one wash.

"October 29, 2019",4,Generally you're ace but please read the content of help emails better!,"I have always found the buy and try option really convenient and the process of returning items super smooth. Recently, I have tried to return a watch that I bought which had an issue after a couple of months. I emailed support to ask how to create a return for an item that no longer had that option in the Accounts section - super speedy response from the service attendant, but the advice was for someone who still had access to the 'create return' button. I emailed again to flag this, received an apology but the same advice. I jumped onto 'chat' - same advice (but got sent to the UK site).  Jumped onto chat AGAIN with a very pleading request to not give me that same advice and a support person called Drew was so swift in fixing the problem (legend!!) I feel like every other time the contents of my email got skimmed over and a generic 'returns' response was sent to me. I think your shop is excellent but I did think it was worth flagging this because, if I were a volatile cranky human, I would have been done with it all."

I did my do diligence and emailed your customer service today to advise that the package was received. No apology, sorry for the inconvenience but a copy/paste of return instructions. I expected my higher level of customer from ASOS. I was inconvenienced with having to find a replacement and now I have to be inconvenienced with going to the post office.

Been ordering for years from them, but next time I'll have to think twice if the item they're showing is the one I'll be getting. Or maybe there just won't be the next time."

So I chatted with Klara support to be told that what showed there was what ASOS would be sending out. So now I had to chat with ASOS!Narked off, I had to go to ASOS chat and spoke to Jaslien. Who after 10 minutes tells me if I receive the wrong orderI can send it back for a refund. WHAT USE IS THAT. I want the right items sent out the first time, just check the order. To which he then tells me what I wanted to know with a link to what WILL be sent out. Then he rounds off the chat with the automated 'hope I helped rubbish'. To which I told him it WAS NOT good enough. Then he shut me down and just went.And it isn't good enough. 10 minutes on Klara, 10 minutes ASOS then 10 minutes writing a review and I'm seething.

"October 28, 2019",1,Very poor service,I purchased the Asos addition embellished dress.The dress itself is beautiful but is very very heavy.  The straps on this dress are very poorly made and are not meant to carry the weight of the dress so you can actually find yourself dress less on the isle.. Mine arrived with a torn strap and when I took it to a tailor she told me that this dress was worn before!When i contacted asos the time table to return and ship another dress would have taken too much time to arrive for my wedding. I was stuck with a torn and 2nd hand dress.Because all the glass beeds are attached to the dress by hand any repair on it is highly expensive. Asos agreed to pay for the repair but it took 100 mails later to actually receive the money.They kept asking me for the details again and again and it took weeks of emailing back and forth until I actually got a little bit of money from them.Very poor service. Won't buy from them ever again.

Checked the tracking on 26/10 to see the expected time of delivery and it showed a message saying 'there has been an error, your parcel will be on the move in the next 48hrs'. I contacted ASOS as I needed the dress for a wedding on 30/10, who informed me they could not do anything until after the 5th November! So I ordered the same dress again and paid ¬£5.95 for next day delivery. The new order arrived and the dress they sent had a hole in it! Contacted ASOS again to complain and to ask them to send out a replacement and they pay for next day delivery. I was told I would first have to return the other dress which can take 7 days to process or order another dress my self and foot the delivery charge again myself!! Useless company with absolutely no customer service!"

I chose Doddle because I've used them before and everything worked great but this time the QR code was scanning but it came up with an error saying theres no item to be returned but clearly there was. I asked for help online and they said to try a different method of returning. I understand that there isn't much to do to fix this issue but it has out a sour taste in my mouth. Will still buy from ASOS because of the quality but I will be wary about the returns."

Hier die Originalantwort:Hello,After an assessment of your account, we've made the decision to not issue a refund for your items.It‚Äôs very rare for items to go missing and ASOS have therefore made the decision to not accept any further orders from you. In order to take this further, we recommend contacting your payment provider to dispute any lost funds.Your payment provider may be in touch with ASOS and we'll be able to provide information regarding your account to support their investigations. Once they're happy this is a genuine claim, they may refund your account. In the event further orders are placed, they'll be cancelled. Any returns will still be processed as normal and you'll receive a notification once the return has reached our warehouse.As we‚Äôre unable to help you further with this, any emails received about this matter will be automatically closed down with no response.

I couldn‚Äôt get through to any contact line rather than their ridiculous online chat, of which I was quite clearly told there was no way of making a complaint, nor for them to have any flexibility in responding to customer needs because of the rigid process in place. Atrocious, and something that has probably affected/ will affect a large proportion of their customer base.

And the fourth item which was the only thing that I received was damaged, which I have received a partial refund for? Yet if I returned it as normal I would have gotten a full refund? Initially the entire purchase was pointless, a waste of my money and time.

They just lied about the delivery date. Definitely won‚Äôt ever buy from them again. Bad is an understatement, their service is horrible and unacceptable. I don‚Äôt even understand how a service could be this terrible. Worst decision ever to order from them."
"October 25, 2019",5,Quick and helpful!,ASOS customer care are always super helpful and really quick at sorting out any problems or questions you have.
"October 25, 2019",1,Terrible customer service with NO complaints process,"When I received my order, the product looked different than the image they were using to sell it. I returned the product and after getting a refund noticed that it was not the full amount. The shipping costs were not returned. I do not expect to pay shipping for a company mis-selling me a product, so I got in touch with customer service. I spent over half an hour talking to a girl who was very unhelpful and abrupt. She stated I would have to cancel my order in writing and then shipping costs could be returned. I asked if this process would still be okay seeing as I have already returned my item to which she changed the subject. I had to ask again before she responded (after 5 minutes of waiting) to say no - I couldn't use this process actually. What a waste of time. I asked her where I could make a complaint about the customer service and procedures to which she changed the subject again. I asked again to which I was told the customer service chats are the complaints and they do not have a direct complaints procedure in place. I asked to speak to a manager which I was told no, I couldn't do, as she had the same training as a manager so it would be no help? Shocking. I stated again that I would like to know how to make a formal complaint that would be received further up in management - she stated ""this is our complaints procedure"" and closed the chat. I shop online a lot and this kind of customer service is very rare, and I am very sad that it happened at ASOS - somewhere I (now used to) shop at a lot."

Another day!! just taking the p**** now . They cant even offer me a refund on my delivery because I have premium and I already get 10% off from uni days so cant even offer me anything as a gesture of goodwill, and all the live chat people are just clearly robots with automated responses.

It makes it extremely inconvenient to find where my order is.  I also didn't know that standard shipping doesn't have tracking information.  International shipping needs tracking.  I just don't understand why anybody would ship to a different country without tracking.  Now I am stuck here, pregnant, waiting for my maternity clothes to come in the mail.  I must wait another 3 weeks (6 weeks total) for ASOS to do anything.  I feel very frustrated, mostly because I really need pants.  I am not just some girl wanting clothes.  I am a growing pregnant lady.  I was going to recommend this company to my friend in Nigeria who is also looking for maternity clothes, but now I just don't think I can recommend it."

Three different staff members emailing me to tell me it should be there, when it most definitely is not.

However, since they changed their delivery service from AusPost to DHL, I have decided that I will not be purchasing from ASOS again. I paid for Premier delivery (a year of express shipping) earlier in the year, but all of my orders arrive AFTER the estimated delivery date because DHL is a terrible delivery service. On average all of my packages arrive 1-2 business days late, but sometimes that includes a weekend in the middle which pushes the delivery up to 4 days later than estimated. I regret ever buying the Premier delivery and from now on I'll be shopping at The Iconic, at least I can be sure that their items will arrive when estimated!"

I spoke to the customer care team in web chat who advised me that I would simply have to order again. I didn't yet have the refund, so had to pay out of pocket for the items - two of which had gone up in price.They advised me that they would refund the difference, and after a lot of persuasion from me, they advised they would refund the cost of next day delivery (¬£5.95) because I needed the items quickly.I paid extra for premier delivery as I use them regularly, and after contacting them to refund the ¬£5.95, I've been told they can't because they would only refund it if it was next day delivery. I've spent upwards of 3 hours web chatting to resolve this, asking for them to help with my complaint, only to be told that I need to log my complaint here. The customer service is pathetic, and I expect to be contacted to discuss this complaint further."

I have used ASOS for years, I am a serial purchaser and sadly this year their customer service has been atrocious. They used to be really willing to help and resolve issues quickly, however they now seem to have a 5 day waiting period before they will even attempt to help you with a delivery issue. No one wants to wait that long and customers shouldn't have to. Customers also shouldn't have the chat just closed on them cause the team member (Stuart) doesn't want to deal with them anymore. I then wrote an email of complaint about the service and received a response telling me I had to wait until tomorrow for my delivery to turn up and then they can help. They completely ignored the content of my email and the issues I had addressed. All in all a very poor experience with them."

I had everything in my cart and forgot to order previous day and now I am not getting any discounts. I contacted y'all and the guy never helped.

Asos in all, I just love.. So much choice and pretty decent prices too. With free delivery and free returns, who can refuse that! The items are well made, good quality materials and products.

Tragically they passed away in a terrible accident so what was intended for a engagement gift became a burial gift instead. The parcel was already 14days overdue with no updates and no one willing to help outside the generic responses until i got Raouf he looked into it further spoke with the specialist team and remade an order which was on express as my original order was lost in transit. I cant expect people to make magic happen but Raoufs empathy and going a the extra mile made all the difference to me and to my family.

The second person just simply said they couldn't help and a specialist team would be in touch within 24hours. I purchased premium delivery and it has literally just ran out and was contemplating picking it up again due to the volume that I order from ASOS but I genuinely trusted as a standard service, I would be able to make an order and have it delivered on time without paying the extra. I made my order on 20/10 and I received notification on 22/10 to say it had been dispatched for delivery.

A week or so later, I received an email with a discount code for ¬£5 apologising for the increase in price. I used this to purchase a top that was badly photographed on the website (you couldn't see it had a cup affect in the top, but I understand black velvet can be tricky to photograph) . I returned the top and was refunded for the money paid, however was not given another ¬£5 discount code. I spoke with the customer service team who said they weren't able to issue me another. So basically I've now been charged more for Premier Delivery than the vast majority of ASOS customers for this year. Feeling so valued."

"October 24, 2019",5,I ordered for the first time from ASOS‚Ä¶,"I ordered for the first time from ASOS to get some maternity pants. I bought 13 pairs to try on because this is my first baby and I have no idea how the different styles fit. Luckily ASOS has a huge selection. When my package arrived, it had a cut across the bag and the bottom was taped shut. Shady? I opened the bag and to my dismay 3 pairs were missing. I immediately contacted customer service and was honestly worried how it might look with such a large order and things missing....but oh my goodness!!! I have never received such wonderful and hasty customer service! I was immediately reassured and received an email within 5 minutes that I would be refunded for the missing items. ASOS, you have no idea how much stress you just saved this pregnant lady! I will definitely be referring my friends to purchase clothing from ASOS. Unfortunately I bought the wrong size (UK to US mixup), but I will definitely be re-ordering without hesitation. Thank you for a great selection, quality products, and amazing customer service!"

"October 24, 2019",1,ASOS doesn‚Äôt care about international customers,"I purchased a bunch of maternity clothes from ASOS totalling around 220 CAD. It then cost me another 50 CAD in customs charges, which I knew would happen but is no small amount. In order for me to be a customer of ASOS, I have to take that hit. Anyway, My clothes arrive and the most expensive item I purchased, a cardigan that cost 70 CAD. It fit great, was exactly what I wanted but to my horror had a huge weird stain on the front near the bottom. This is not my fault obviously and the sweater was sealed perfectly when I received it. This didn‚Äôt happen in transit. ASOS sent me this sweater with a huge stain from their warehouse. I contacted customer service provided pictures and they told me they would refund me but I had to send back the sweater, or they would replace it if I sent it back. Either way that‚Äôs MORE money. 20 CAD to return it and receive the money back, or 20 to return and another 20 upon receiving the new sweater in MORE customs charges. The customer service person told me it‚Äôs not their problem I have to pay import taxes, üòï, and if I wanted THEIR mistake to be fixed I would have to keep the stained 70 dollar sweater or pay more money to get my money back, or the worst option pay another 40 dollars to risk them sending me another faulty sweater and maybe get a new sweater for a grand total of 110 CAD. All because ASOS is unprofessional and has totally inconsiderate protocol for helping international customers fix the problems they are responsible for. Needless to say I won‚Äôt be spending more money, I‚Äôll keep the stained sweater and never ever be purchasing anything from ASOS again. International customers beware. If they send you the wrong item, or something damaged you‚Äôre screwed and they won‚Äôt help you."
"October 24, 2019",1,Unfortunately I experienced really bad‚Ä¶,"Unfortunately I experienced really bad service. I've been a loyal customer for the last ten years, but I will never buy anything on Asos again.I ordered three items. When I ordered I could choose a free express delivery because the amount of the items exceeded 220$. When I received the items only one item wasn't damaged. Two of them had lost pearls, sequins and had lots of loose threads. I therefore returned two of the two items. When I received my refund Asos had charged me the $60 express delivery fee. I contacted Asos customer service and explained the items were damaged and I had no other option than returning the items. They still wouldn't pay me the $60."
"October 24, 2019",1,express shipping fail,Chose the express option shipping to get item before weekend for an event but item now delayed meaning I‚Äôll now need to buy elsewhere. Had chosen Asos for the express delivery option. Contacted customer support who apologised but offered no compensation or alternatives.
"October 24, 2019",2,"Customer service sucks, order packing sucks","To be honest I‚Äôve never had such a crappy experience dealing with customer service as I just had. I made two orders and just received one of them. It was missing three items, and some unpackaged pants and an empty bag mean for a blouse that I didn‚Äôt order came in the package instead. First time I contacted customer service I was told that theyd have their specialist team look into it and i was fine with that.  And not even a few minutes later I got an email from them saying they‚Äôd refunded me for my items. I didn‚Äôt ask for that nor was I asked if I wanted a refund. I wanted my items. So I had talk to customer service again. And to be fairly honest I was a bit rude, but the customer service is in a chat only format so a five minute conversation turned into twenty minutes and I got pissy because the guy was acting like he didn‚Äôt know what customer service is and couldn‚Äôt think of any solution other than sorry you‚Äôre not happy. And then he disconnected the chat.Im honestly surprised I got decent help the third time. I spent $300+ on these two orders not to mention my previous orders throughout the year. It just really sucks that they can‚Äôt invest in better customer care. And if the policy is to not ask if someone wants their items sent to them or not, because that‚Äôs really stupid and if someone‚Äôs paying for your products you shouldn‚Äôt just always assume they want the money back.I‚Äôm just not going to be ordering from here until they get it together as a company because between the customer service and my missing items it‚Äôs not worth the time and money I‚Äôm putting towards it."

Their customer service is truly shocking, robotic AI messages. Shop elsewhere!"
"October 23, 2019",1,Shocking service,Shocking service! Ordered 4 items for my upcoming holiday and 2 out of the 4 items were wrong. One I received the wrong size and the other I received a plain T-shirt when I ordered one with a design on it. Don‚Äôt try and get any remorse from ASOS customer care! They‚Äôll just tell you to send it back for a refund which is what is common knowledge and their legal obligation anyway! Previous returns arranged with DPD were not made to me and I was only informed a week later it was being refunded (I had to wait this long even though I called numerous times to find out where my order was - I pay for next day delivery). On being told I was not getting my orders I resubmitted the order but missed out on the sales prices I was getting originally!Asos have lost their touch and do not care about their customers anymore! Maybe they‚Äôve got too big for themselves!

"October 23, 2019",1,I got the wrong item,"I got the wrong item from them. Order a size 10 got size 12. Contacted the customer service but all they told me was I need to fix their problem myself. I have to pay extra time to send it back then contact the customer service to have my money back, then track my account to check if I have received the refund, then order again, then pay for express delivery ( if I want receive new item on time) then pay for the extra healing fee to the bank then I need to  contact costumer service again only to get the delivery fee back, ( not the creative card handling fee). Their customer service was just awful. I had to talk to two people to ease my mood. I was furious. I felt bad enough to receive wrong item. Only the second one offered some solutions, I was not happy but I felt like I can only accept otherwise they was just like they are not going to do anything fix it like they are saying ‚Äú that‚Äôs your unluck not our fault‚Äù. They just don‚Äôt seem to understand how much hassles and extra time and money and HASSLE the oversea customer have to pay, even they said they would refund for the post and delivery but I still have paid extra credit card handling fee because of their mistakes.Im just very very disappointed their way to handling their own mistakes. I hope they can have some people to collect their wrong items themselves, if the company think that was too much trouble it means they just put the cost of fixing their own mistakes on their customers! Which is not fair and not honest! Awful awful awful awful customer service."
"October 23, 2019",1,Was a customer of Asos for quite some‚Ä¶,"Was a customer of Asos for quite some time and never ever had any problems until recently. All my latest orders have been very late. The latest one was supposedly been delivered to a neighbor but funnily that neighbor doesn't live there, just comes to check on the place once in a while. So no idea how the delivery person left it with a neighbor that wasn't there. The customer care team told me I have to wait as actually the parcel hasn't been delivered, but is with the courier and I have to allow another week for the delivery. Same thing happened before when I ordered something for an occasion and that thing arrived like two weeks later when I didn't need it anymore and obviously they didn't let me cancel as it was 'in transit'. Really crappy service, Asos. Never using your crap shop again."

"October 23, 2019",1,NO ORDER DELIVERED - NO REFUND PROVIDED. PLEASE HELP.,"I made an order weeks ago and never received it. As the estimated arrival date came and went, I received no notice of issue from ASOS or the Shipper. I looked into the issue and found that the item was returned to ASOS due to an issue with the address. I cannot identify an issue in address, so I cannot amend it. I then went to the ASOS website to request that customer service reach out via email to solve the problem. I never received word back. I went to the site again, wasting more time on this issue, and spoke with Erim from the Chat window. Nothing was solved, although Erim was prompt in response time. I have had a terrible experience with ASOS. ASOS Customer service has failed to assist with any of the problems related to this order. I do not have my order, my money, or the time that has been wasted dealing with this issue. Please refund my order ASAP. I absolutely should not have to be this proactive to solve an internal problem."

I should not be told that when an item arrives in Perth on 17 October that I may have to wait until 28 October before it can be delivered to an address less than 20km away and that Asos cannot contact Australia Post to find out what is going on due to the terms of their contract with them. Very, very disappointing. The only thing that Australia Post deliver on a consistent basis is a poor performance."

As I've never had any issues before, I just got on with it. For the latest issue, I contacted their customer service team who told me they weren't willing to do anything to help. When I went back to them to say that it wasn't good enough, she replied saying if I wasn't happy I could just post a bad review online, so that's what I'm doing. Aside from being useless and not being able to help, the very fact that ANY company would point someone to post a bad review is beyond comprehension."

My order was returned before it was ever delivered. In the meantime via text chat I was told I would have to wait 10 business days to get my refund for items I never received. On the 10th day I was told I would have to wait until the 11th day in order to get an email regarding my refund. On the 11th day of inquiring about my refund. I was told my return date was 3 days later than it was. In which I promptly disputed because I had the tracking dates in which the items were returned. Now I am told I will get an email regarding my refund tomorrow. FRUSTRATING is not even the best word to describe how poorly this has been handled. The merchandise is lovely but pointless if you never get it and have to wait basically 2 weeks to get your money back! Bad form ASOS bad form.

I was told that the payment will be returned in 'up to 10 working days' and if I want to re order, I have to go through the whole process again. Honestly - this is unacceptable. I am out of pocket until Asos decide to return the payment (obviously some automated system) and if I want to re-order the declined order, I need to go through the whole process again. Plus, I have no idea why the card was declined - the money came out so there is clearly nothing wrong with that. I found the chat unhelpful - I am none the wiser and don't have my money (or my order)"

"October 23, 2019",5,Change my order,"Even though I could not change my order anymore, the customer service was available quickly by using the chatservice. The employee I spoke to was friendly."
"October 23, 2019",2,This is my first time ordering from‚Ä¶,This is my first time ordering from ASOS and my package did not arrive. The associate assisting me asked the same questions and insisted the package was delivered even though I assured him/her that it was not. We have a Ring doorbell at our front door and there were no deliveries recorder when the package was supposedly delivered. I just want the shoes I ordered or I would like a refund. Disappointed that I am now told to wait another 24 hours for assistance.

"October 23, 2019",5,Answers and options.,"Lots of detailed, helpful information. Gave me honest answers and options. Great."
"October 23, 2019",1,Terrible customer service,"Absolutely love shopping on ASOS, but sadly this last experience leaves a lot to say as a recurring customer: purchased the final size in a full priced dress on a Saturday, only to have a code for 50$ off be active on the site on Sunday, my order wasn‚Äôt shipped out until Tuesday afternoon, for which reason since the code was active before my order was even fulfilled I contacted customer service to have them apply said code to my order and have 50$ refunded to my balance, only to be told this was ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù and that the only solution was to ‚Äúpurchase a new dress and return the one from the original order‚Äù, to which I explained I purchased the final sized and was answered oops ‚Äútheres nothing further I can advise you on‚Äù. Terrible customer service for such a large company, most (as I‚Äôve had it happen before), respect promotions within a time staple specially from subscribed customers."
"October 23, 2019",1,Very annoying experience,My order was lost I think? They didn‚Äôt tell me what was wrong and the person I spoke to was very abrupt and obviously just wanted me to go away and said someone will email me but instead they just refunded it without telling me anything after I waited for 3 weeks for my order so I messaged saying I still wish to get the items and would like more information and they said the items were out of stock but I looked on their website and both items are still in stock very annoying experience.
"October 23, 2019",1,"Wrong dress delivered, can't give me what I ordered","I am extremely disappointed with ASOS. I ordered a dress for a Halloween party (multiple now) and I was sent the incorrect dress. Not only could I not get the dress I ordered in time, but it is no longer available. So I have a dress I don't want (which I will return), but there isn't much ASOS is willing to do to remedy this error ON THEIR PART. In the past I have been a fan of ASOS and I wanted to order from somewhere other than Amazon. It seems I will continue using Amazon, as ASOS isn't able to deliver on what I have ordered."
"October 22, 2019",2,ASOS incorrectly charged me and Customer Service hung up/ended their chat with me when i raised the issue...,"I had placed my order using the code VOSN25 and should have been entitled to a 25% discount but instead, a 20% discount was incorrectly applied. I had checked the terms & conditions of the promo offer and I had ordered a full priced item that was shipping to Australia so my order met the conditions to be able to get the full 25% discount - so it was an error on ASOS's part. I tried to chat to Customer Service shortly after and was put through to Emily....before she even said anything I was notified through the chat that ""you're now chatting to Larisa"". I was confused as to what happened but nevertheless, went on to describe the issue to Larisa again, only to have her end the chat with me right then and there. This is the equivalent to hanging up on your customer right after hearing their issues. I then had to go through the chat room again and spoke to Kevin who advised that I'd need to call back in about 1 hour because he couldn't see the order in your system - I couldn't do this because it was already past midnight my time. I then had to contact customer service again for the third time the next morning and spoke to Andrew who admitted that I was incorrectly charged for my order and advised that I will need to contact customer service again after I receive the item, so that you can refund the difference in the amount to me as the order can no longer be amended. This means that by the time I resolve the issue (which is completely an error on your part), I would have had to contact ASOS Customer Service FOUR TIMES. With the first two times involving Emily and Larisa who completely ignored me and effectively hung up on me - this is the part that angers me most. If it wasn't for Andrew who in the end tried his best to be helpful, I would have rated ASOS Customer Service 1 star. I haven't purchased from ASOS in a while and this has just reminded me again of why I have moved on to other online retailers such as Revolve and Shopbop. Ridiculous!!!!"

I was so worried about my personal details being compromised and I contacted ASOS straight away on live chat. I luckily got talking to Kamran, who took the issue seriously and escalated the issue quickly and explained to me how ASOS would get in contact. In the meantime, he provided me with information about how I could still return items that I did not want to keep as I didn‚Äôt not have the delivery note with the returns information. Very helpful, very polite and I appreciate his help immensely. Hopefully this will be resolved quickly and I can confidently shop with ASOS still, as I have done for years. Thank you again Kamran."

"October 22, 2019",4,Happy with ASOS chat function for easy contact,"Wait wasn‚Äôt too long, about 7 minutes, which I don‚Äôt mind as I can do other things while waiting rather than being on hold on a phone call. The advisor was helpful and quick to respond.I think ASOS should offer to take action against the courier sooner than 5 days / full working week of delays. I pay for next day delivery so for the courier to delay delivery 5 days in a row without consequence is unreasonable in my opinion."
"October 22, 2019",5,Devinia Rocks!,"Devinia Rocks!My customer support agent, Devinia, was extremely helpful! She had quick and simple solutions for my issue and she seemed genuinely willing to help me. I like when I have the feeling that I am talking to a real person in live chat rather than just a ""bot"". Using humour and real human conversation is important to me and she did both of those things, making me feel comfortable with ASOS. She should be rewarded!"
"October 22, 2019",5,ASOS is the best,I've shopped on asos for years and I've only had a couple of problems which the customer service have been more than happy to help with and have been solved immediately
"October 22, 2019",1,I pay asos for premium delivery,I pay asos for premium delivery. I did not receive premium delivery and on the first occasion was told it was the couriers fault although asos had not even dispatched my order. On the 2nd occasion the advisor cancelled my whole order. Told me to re order but I would not get my refund for 10 days. To top that off some of my stuff is now out of stock. I've been loyal customer for 10 years and asos did nothing to rectify any of the issues but just told me to re order and request to be notified when my items are back in stock. Had to be the poorest customer service I have experienced in a long time.
"October 22, 2019",1,Next day delivery- 6 days!?!ery,"I ordered with next day delivery on a Friday, and didn't receive any delivery information until the Monday. The courier said they tried Monday which they did not, or Tuesday. I messaged the ASOS chat (Grant) on the Tuesday asking him to look into the delivery. He replied (not apologising at any point for the delay) saying it should be here by Thursday (6 days for next day delivery?) And that we have to allow that time frame if it's unexpected delays... Very unsatisfied"
"October 22, 2019",4,Tatty Packaging but Helpful Service.,"I ordered multiple pairs of boots and when received, it was like they had been returned and then sent to me without being checked. The tissue paper was missing and ripped, the suede boots had fluff and bits all over them. Yes, it is just the packaging and the boots can be cleaned, but as an improvement, for the price they were, I feel like I should have received these in better condition.I spoke to RIA on a live chat as I needed help finding a link to Hermes Collection Returns. She was very helpful and quickly sent me a link to an ASOS returns page which had a link to the Hermes Page :)"

The chat customer service is the worst, and there is no live number to talk to anyone. They send you a pre paid return label with your purchase and have ZERO way of giving you a copy of the return label or anything on the label that THEY PRINTED and shipped with your package. I lost a lot of money because of their failure to take any accountability for their return process. They should just have you print your return label so there is some paper trail of information on the return label. The customer service chat rep also kept asking me if ""that was all for today"" again and again through our conversation as to cut me off from trying to find some solution to this problem. I will be disputing the charge now because my package was sent out from the UPS location and no one can find it."

"October 22, 2019",1,awful advisor called Yunis,I was speaking to Yunis and he was the most unhelpful advisor. He was rude by closing the chat on me when I hadn‚Äôt finished speaking and I would appreciate something further to be done. He shouldn‚Äôt be in customer service if he has no customer skills.

"October 22, 2019",1,My package was not delivered,"My package was not delivered. I know this because we were home when it was supposed to be delivered. Due to the way ASOS shipped it, I wasn't allowed to file a claim with the shipper but ASOS required me to try to track down my package before they'd do anything about it. I have very little faith that my order will be found or refunded."

"October 22, 2019",1,After speaking with ASOS support,"After speaking with ASOS support, it is clear they do not value their customers. I placed my first order ever and used a 15% off promo code. I spent hours carefully choosing my favorite items! When they arrived, everything was too big. Since ASOS doesn't allow exchanges, I wanted to return the items and reorder the proper sizes, but the 15% off promo is no longer valid. ASOS was unwilling to allow me to repurchase the proper sizes at the same price, which clearly tells me they do not care whether they lose me as a customer. I'll be returning my items for a refund and am currently working with someone from ASOS to close my account permanently. This whole experience has been extremely frustrating. Now that I know my proper size, I was looking forward to many more ASOS purchases. It's truly disappointing that ASOS does not care enough to allow me to repurchase the items I love in the proper size at the price I paid originally."

No where during the checkout process was I informed that express shipping can not be provided to a parcel locker address. Chat advisor was condescending and unhelpful, stated that despite being ineligible for express shipping the money I provided for express shipping service will be kept by ASOS, and that there is nothing that can be done to amend this. Australian consumer law protects consumers against mishaps such as this, and by keeping my money and failing to provide the service within the time frame specified is breaching ACCC guidelines. I would like this to be remedied otherwise I will be escalating this further."

"October 22, 2019",2,Wasted my time and expectation!,"Bought a pair of white boots on ASOS. And when I unpacked them. Found there is a obvious black scratch in front of the left shoe. I have been waiting for a long time for the delivery, and was going to bring those shoes to go travel soon. So I tried to contact with Asos assistance to talk about if I can get a discount for those faulty shoes. Apparently, I don't have enough time to return them and get one new pair to be delivered to mine before I go travel. But they only give me two options: either I keep them for full price, or I can return them to get a refund... I paid the money for a pair of new boots, not a second-hand quality boots! So they wasted the customer‚Äôs time and expectation,  they don't give a fxxking care! That's Asos! And I also wondering, don't you check the products before you send them out? Asos?! Or you just can not see that obvious black mark on the shoes? ! And the online Asos assistance is not doing too much. They only can repeat again and again like a robot: please return the items back to us to get the refund....can not solve any problem, I know I can return them and I can do it online without you telling me. But the purpose of getting assistance is to help customers to solve the problem they have from Asos. Not telling the nonsense!"

And this is the second occurrence in 7 weeks.My parcel has been displayed on the Hermes website as ""delayed. will be on its way to you in the next 24 hours"" for nearly five days now & ASOS cannot do anything to rectify the solution. I have been informed by an ASOS customer service member that they are not allowed to contact Hermes with any delivery/customer issues as per their contract with each other, so instead the ASOS team respond to customers with halfhearted canned messages. How they expect to maintain a happy customer base is beyond me.. Poor efforts by both ASOS and Hermes. Looks like their three-legged run at fast fashion will come to an end sooner than expected, so really a win for all, especially the environment. Let's shop local, purchase secondhand & support small businesses. Cya, ASOS! And Hermes, you pathetic attempt of a delivery company."

Then you call, and they give you another further date to call back at. When you ask them what they will do to resolve it at the future date, they say they can't advise you of that.

"October 21, 2019",1,Does not deserve any stars,"I ordered a pair of shoes from ASOS and they sent me visibly damaged, scuffed, and even stained shoes. I am appalled that ASOS finds it acceptable to ship damaged shoes to customers in the expectation that they would actually keep them. When I tried to initiate a return, I realized the packing slip they provided was for a completely different person and order. So now probably someone else has my personal information in their defective order, just like I have some random person's information. I've tried three times to get headway with ASOS customer service and they're awful. The first time no one responded after 5 minutes of initiating a chat. The second time I asked them to tell me what exactly happens with returned shoes, and whether they intend to resell them to someone else (I am sure I received someone's damaged shoes). They allege they would take the product out of their stock, but clearly that isn't the case given the state of the product I received. The third time I told them I received someone else's packing slip and can't even initiate a return with it. I asked for a link to where I can file a formal complaint, and conveniently [for them] they do not have one. Then I asked for the email addresses of departments that are in charge of quality assurance or corporate responsibility, etc. Again, no go. I finally asked what exactly ASOS does to achieve customer service if there is no way to accept feedback to improve. The agent said that customers can ""chat online."" Clearly ASOS is stuck in a perpetual model of customer dissatisfaction with poor-quality apparel that they think is passable. What a horrible company. I am disgusted by the way they treat their customers. This company is a scam."

I requested for a refund... and then never got sent the sheet that‚Äôs supposed to go in my package. I reached out to customer support. This took almost an hour to load. I was quite mad by this point. Finally I got to return my package. 2 weeks later. Still hadn‚Äôt heard anything from ASOS. Decided to contact them. The contact me page wouldn‚Äôt load AT ALL. I logged into messenger instead. The reply time was awful but FINALLY got a response. She told me she‚Äôd look into why I hadn‚Äôt got my refund and I‚Äôd hear something within 24 hours. It‚Äôs been two days and still nothing. I basically paid 90 dollars to try on a skirt. Not happy at all. At the same time I sent in my package for the skirt I also sent in a return from the iconic and the shirt was too small for my partner. I was contacted instantly and was sent a refund within 7 days. This was much better service.

I needed the suit for a function that weekend but by the time I found out I had 2 days to find a replacement. When I contacted ASOS the team were not helpful at all! ignored my questions and kept sending generic messages. It has now been 2 weeks and I still have not had my refund and ASOS have no idea what has gone wrong. I have used ASOS for many years and they have been very reliable but this issue has raised concerns for me to trust them to deliver due to the experience I have received. I have no answers and the staff seem to not care. ASOS need to sort this out and improve their service before they crumble.

The only reason we found it because we were cutting our hedge later on. When i complained to ASOS, the tracking link actually said i signed for it at 20.45. This was not the case. However ASOS merely said that this wasnt their problem and I should speak to UK mail as they are a sepearate company. This is terrible customer service. When you order something from ASOS, you are putting trust in them that they'll get what you ordered to you as requested. if this doesnt happen, you would hope they would take responsibiltiy for it. I would advise people to use some of the newer up and coming ecommerce sites who take responsibilty for their suppliers and value their customers!"

We are less than 2 weeks away from our wedding and all we were told is we would have to reorder the shoes if we wanted them in time, which came at an added cost of ¬£5.99 for next day delivery, which we were told would be reimbursed- strangely no note was left on the account to advise this would be the case and low and behold - no refund on the ¬£5.99 was given. It is clear to me from the communication we have had and the errors on their part, that their staff need some serious training. Avoid at all costs, they are definitely not deserving of their customers money. Thank you for causing far more stress than needed for our wedding! Will never ever use this service again"

I am now down an extra ¬£360 as I have had to pay double until the 10 working days it takes for my refund to clear.In addition if I want them to pay to send it next day based on their error then I have to recontact them for a third time (wait for the dispatch email then wait for the chat to connect) to give them my order number. Very unhelpful and robotic response from the customer help line.

The delivery attempt was made at 7pm and the delivery courier didnt bother leaving it in a safe place. On tuesday the second delivery attempt was to take place. I got no email, no time scale of when to accept the parcel, nothing. Tuesday had passed and as i tracked the online delivery, it showed mondays update (so they hadnt updated the system). This went on for the whole week and when I spoke to Asos customer care, they were awfully rude. They didnt accept liability, stating sometimes orders can be delayed. But if thats the case why did I have to pay a premium price yet get nothing in return. They then closed the chat and didnt bother wanting to solve anything.

Turns out they were not bothering to do this and had just refunded me without informing me first. As of right now no refund has shown in my account so I don't know if they actually have refunded or not but they are insisting they have. They are now demanding I return the shoes. Not only did my shoes (that were for a job interview and ordered in plenty of time) arrive too late but now they want me to return them and have given me a refund I didn't even ask for.

"October 20, 2019",1,Two months and still waiting for refund,"I sent an item for refund and received ASOS receipt to say that refund was in progress.  That was on the 9 August 2019.  I sent them a follow up email a month about a month ago to send me proof of refund, I am still waiting.  I can never shop from them again as I can't trust them."

"October 20, 2019",5,"Online ASOS chat with Nif√©. Reference# 23114535 - one of the most kind, helpful, valuable positive customer service interactions I have had in a long time!!!","Today I had the pleasure of chatting online with a very kind ASOS employee, named Nif√©, chat reference #23114535. As I mentioned in the title already, yet is indeed absolutely worth noting again, that this person definitely gave me one of the most positive customer service interactions that I have had in quite a long time. This holds true to all of my customer service, whether it be through a chat, phone call, e-mail, or in person. I purchase a lot of clothes, make up, skincare, and haircare from varied, diverse companies. After selling our first house, not too long ago  and upgrading to a much larger home, we have dealt with numerous furniture companies, and countless of places that sell any related items needed/wanted, for the inside of a home. Furthermore, our property is large, so we also dealt with tons of companies when it came to upgrading the sunroom, different things needed for an in ground pool, grass maintenance and everything in between. One thing worth stating for the purpose of the review is our new home is twice the size of our old home (4 additional rooms then our old house, which we left fully furnished) and having to buy different things we didn't need previously. Needless to say, the amount of customer service experience I have is vast and I have dealt with far more bad then good,and sometimes ok. I had very rude encounters with customer service/management from places I spent thousands in, and many horrible experiences was after being a customer for many years in some places. Today, I chatted with Nif√© from ASOS and was treated with respect and addressed all my questions 100% and remained kind the whole time. I rarely write these reviews, but I believe it should be noted that your employee is dedicated to doing his job beyond what is required, and answered all my questions fully, with extra useful information. Nif√© was a breath of fresh air, and I hope he/she is appreciated for their outstanding work ethic, excellent manners, and ability to over excel at ASOS, while remaining completely professional, courteous, and shows he/she is happy to help!unquestionably"

Everything looks great until you receive the wrong size... Their customer service is below any standards. They are extremely rude, close chats in the middle of the conversation, they never even try to look to be helpful, they just answer your questions in a very rude way and don‚Äôt care. If you ordered a wrong size (UK vs.US) that is basically YOUR problem and deal with it. Second - no exchange policy. That means if you used a promo code and ordered some stuff and then you need to exchange it - forget about the promo code. Who the heck does it?????? Seriously, ASOS you have so much to learn!! All bad reviews here are legit. Sadly, I had add another one and if you had better customer service it wouldn‚Äôt happen. Shame on you!"

"October 19, 2019",1,Claim they cannot contractually have contact with their own courier to help with missing delivery,"After spending thousands over the years at ASOS, I made a next day delivery purchase and for the first time it hadn‚Äôt arrived. This is because in the last month, their courier Hermes have constantly been not delivering my parcels and having what seems like a glitch with my address. I asked ASOS to contact Hermes as a) Hermes are uncontactable b) they make you speak only through the retailer eg ASOS c) the glitch means I have no idea where the parcel is and when it will come d) every other retailer has happily contacted Hermes on my behalf to request to know where the parcel is. On the ASOS online chat to Bethany, she informed that they cannot contractually speak to Hermes on my behalf!!!! Which means I can‚Äôt contact them and they can‚Äôt but I have paid money for a product they have no control over. I HIGHLY doubt that they are contractually obliged to no contact with their own couriers. They said to allow 6 days for a next day delivery. All I want is to know when it will come because the online tracking is stuck on a delivery time that passed long ago and this happens over and over again. I‚Äôm pretty appalled at the absurdity of them having this contract of silence with their own courier. I feel fobbed off and lied to."
"October 19, 2019",1,WARNING: ASOS LIES ABOUT PACKAGES FOR WEEKS,"This is my first time ever reviewing anything; I must WARN EVERYBODY:After exactly 2 weeks of straight-up lies about my parcel being in delivery, three talks with the customer service, they've sent me a mail declaring that the items I have ordered (and were supposedly on their way) are in fact out of stock.Before this, they refused to send me any updates about the whereabouts of the package, I had to reach out to their amateurish live chat support to find out everything.The funny thing is that both items are still in stock on their website (and in my size) so even their last mail was a lie."

I placed an order for next day delivery and two days later I hadn't received my parcel so I spoke with an ASOS customer service representative on Chat. She was incredibly unhelpful and unapologetic. She did not offer me a valid explanation as to why I hadn't received my parcel - just that it was a problem with the courier service and that I had to wait for delivery until the next week.I waited patiently until the next week, but my parcel never arrived. I emailed ASOS enquiring why it still hadn't arrived, and I received no response. They just sent me a refund (minus my next day delivery fee!!). I did not ask for a refund at any point. I received absolutely no explanation as to why my items never arrived. I am honestly appalled by the service I've received from ASOS."
"October 19, 2019",1,Awful customer service - issue still unresolved,"I had an awful experience dealing with Asos customer service! I placed an order for next day delivery and 7 days later I am still waiting for my delivery. Asos has been contacted 3x regarding this issue, the fist time I contacted them the person I spoke to came across very nonchalant and rude person who did not take my concerns seriously explaining it should be with me by in the next couple of days... a couple of days later I spoke to another person from customer service and they said it should be with me in the evening if not contact them again the following day. When contacting for the third time I was advised that the parcel could be lost. Honestly this was a complete waste of my time, had there had been transparency from the beginning from ASOS I would not have been chasing them! I would have reordered my item, as there was a reason I ordered the items to come next day!  Continuing I would have expected to be contacted by ASOS that there had been a delay in my delivery not me contacting them! Surely that is common curtesy, with continuous updates of the status of my products... worst customer service ever! As long as they have received their money they are not interested in what happens to your goods!! The people that work within the customer service team need further training on empathy and sincerity... as well as product knowledge especially around the transparency of a delivery issue!"

However, it's ten days late and no longer trackable. I've chatted with ASOS Customer Service three times in the last ten days, and each time they've refused to give me a refund despite the fact that the delivery company cannot locate my order. Once, Customer Service logged off before I received an answer regarding the status of my refund, saying ""We've helped you with all we can."" I will be extremely upset with this company until I get my money back, and I'll never shop with them again - not because they lost my order, but because they clearly don't care to make it right."

"October 18, 2019",1,If I could possibly give less than 1‚Ä¶,"If I could possibly give less than 1 star I would.I have been a repeat customer of Asos for years and never had any issues until recently. I placed a large order for items from Asos as I was going away on holiday however the parcel never arrived. I contacted Asos customer services as according to the tracking information it had been delivered and left in the porch, which I thought was very careless being as the sum of the parcel was ¬£1600. I have never stated that my parcels can be left within an area of my building other than being given to myself with my signature.After providing my information Asos stated that DPD have left the parcel in a safe place (front porch) and will be closing the case without refunding me. I have asked for photographs of the location in which this was left as they have managed to lose a very expensive parcel without providing me with any information or receiving a signature. When Asos emailed me back it was with another customer care representative who stated that DPD left the parcel with a neighbor but did not state which one. I again emailed back complaining that I would like my money refunding as none of my neighbors have received a parcel on my behalf. I was then emailed by again another different customer care representative who stated that DPD had spoken to a neighbor and left the parcel in a safe place but are yet to provide with any supportive evidence this was actually completed. Throughout this whole ordeal I have spoken to many various employees of the ASOS customer care team but not one has been helpful and each one has told me conflicting information. I do not expect this from a company as large as ASOS. This is a lot of my hard earned money that has been stolen by the organisation without providing me for the goods I have paid for."

I was told it was lost and I would receive a refund 7 working days after it had been received back by them! I had placed a duplicate order as advised by a response by email, and when that didn't arrive three days after being placed I queried this and was told I had refused it or it had been lost by the courier!!! I was in all day. No cards or knocks on the door. I know the Hermes courier well and she would not return my order if I was out.I was told again, no refund until they receive the parcel back in their warehouse...bearing in mind again they said this second order may too have been lost! Two lost orders, no refund, APPALLING and repetitive customer services who have the same response and are of no help whatsoever.  Also refusing to refund the ¬£10 next day annual delivery charge, in spite of it being a service which does not work.I would avoid this company unless you're prepared to lose your money!"

"October 17, 2019",1,First let me start by saying I‚Ä¶,"First let me start by saying I absolutely love ASOS!. It's been over a year since I started shopping with them and the experience has been almost too good to be true. I myself fashionable, however I tend to have my own style. With a Asos  I always seem to find the statement piece,  accessory or fashion staple either at a great price our within reason.  There have been times that the price didn't even matter,  i had to have it.  However Customer service,  despite being extremely pleasant is SORELY DISAPPOINTING. I regularly wreck my budget for an items on Asos, i'm on the site daily. I utilize 2 day shipping and through experience ive learned to keep in mind that it may very well be longer,  thankfully  not regularly and now they try to give you a heads up when they're super busy.  So hey it's still a great deal..HOWEVER if you by chance receive a faulty item ...YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK IN A BIG WAY! Of course you may return it and receive a refund or credit depending on when you get it back tt them. BUT if you can't afford to repurchase it at that time or before it goes OUT OF STOCK... OH WELL,  you have no recourse.  NO. They won't hold a replacement for you until they receive your return...NO. They wont send a replacement and wait for their return. NO. They don't give you an OOPS WE GOOFED discount of  your next purchase..YOU may return your item within 45 days for a refund...i guess i should be grateful but i don't.  I mean they're in the fashion business right so they must know that people's emotions are attached to these purchases ...at least mine are. In fact I know they do because each back in stock notification I receive from them starts with GO...GO...GO. besides,  i communicated how  i felt. Admittedly I got over it and continued shopping as I'm guessing they knew I would. But each time it's the same response and THATS JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE .IN GOOD FAITH I sent you money for an item I expected to receive. You sent me previously worn damaged merchandise. A some point ""you can send it back""  just isn't enough.ASOS.. you're great! PLEASE BE BETTER"

Did not understand what I wanted, did not offer me any discount for my troubles when their company are the ones who made a mistake twice."

There was an issue with products being incorrectly labelled so I received the wrong item twice and wanted to make sure it didn‚Äôt keep happening. It was a bit of a unique problem so I can understand the confusion and the cookie cutter responses on twitter, but I‚Äôd recommend using live chat for any unique issue like this."

Ordering us easy, but the returns process, especially if getting a replacement product would put me off using them again.

The quality of customer care on numerous occasions has been shockingly poor.  Customer service reps are clearly disengaged, impatient and uninterested.  Their tone is often condescending and they are unwilling to make any extra effort to resolve issues.  They actually make you feel like you are burdening them by calling when the problem is often related to system delays, courier issues, etc..."

Their customer service is shocking and quality of products seems to have gotten a lot worse. Delivery never comes in time even when you pay for next day delivery, but asos don't seem to care when you complain about anything. Most companies will offer some kind of compensation but not asos. They never used to be like this so not sure what happened but they've lost a customer! Shocking company"
"October 17, 2019",1,contact centre,The team who work for the contact centre are all very unhelpful palming me off every time I ask a question and telling me to message the next day to have the same happen with another person  I find them rude and condescending  I understand sometimes they can‚Äôt help but they also need to explain stuff better instead of just palming someone off or just ending the chat  over the last four days I have spoken to four different people the only one who was slightly helpful was the last and all they did was pass it on to another department

"October 17, 2019",3,Customer service is of little service,"I love Asos and shop here from time to time. Most often I‚Äôm satisfied with the pricing, shipping and quality of items. If anything, it‚Äôs the lack of flexibility of the customer service reps that could use some work. I placed an order and immediately realized that I selected the wrong shipping address. Three minutes later I‚Äôm chatting with someone, great on the timing, but the response was that the address could not be changed once the order was placed. I would have to cancel and place it again. Only 1) I used a coupon code and didn‚Äôt want to take the chance that it wouldn‚Äôt work the second time around and 2) one of the items I purchased was the last in that size. I was afraid that it would take some time to update availability and I wouldn‚Äôt see the size as an option to placed in my cart. So ultimately the order will be sent to the wrong address and I‚Äôll make a trip there to collect it. My other issue is that when you do use a coupon to buy something, if you need to exchange it for some reason, even for a reason outside of your control (e.g. wrong size was sent or item is defective), they will never give you a code, credit or option for exchange. You always have to return the item and repurchase it at the current website pricing. If I saved $10 on a dress the first time I bought it, I don‚Äôt want to lose that discount because you sent me the wrong size. It‚Äôs disappointing that they have zero flexibility and always give you a canned response. For instance, I had a coupon when I purchased the dress I received today. Only I ordered a medium and in the bag was a small. Now all I can do is return and place a brand new order sans coupon. Not great."

"October 16, 2019",1,Never been more angry at an order.,"Never been more angry at an order.This has been the worst online shopping experience. My shoe size is a US size 5.5. I ordered a pair of shoes in the size UK 3, which is supposed to convert over to US 5. I was worried they'd be too small, but they are at least one size too big. They are huge on me and unwearable. They also have several scuff marks on the sides, as if someone has worn them or damaged them somehow.I paid extra for express shipping because I needed them for a wedding this weekend. They arrived on time but I now don't have enough time to exchange them for something wearable. The shoes themselves were a little over $73 and the shipping was $20. At the door, I had to pay another $40.43 in customs.I also got a pair of earrings in the same order that came broken. I can't get the backs off them because the pierce part is bent on both of them. Again, unwearable.In order to get a refund, I have to now pay an ADDITIONAL $22 to ship my order back to ASOS. So that means I'll be able to get just $92.39 back of the $175.23 I spent. I'll be out $82.84 AND I'll have NO SHOES and NO EARRINGS to wear this weekend. Might as well have just thrown my cash into a blender. Would have saved me the disappointment."
"October 16, 2019",1,I ordered a watch and received a dress,"I ordered a watch and received a dress. I returned the incorrect item the same day I received it. Asos then said I had to re-order and re-pay for the correct item again and that they would refund me when the incorrect item was returned. I then re-ordered the watch and received THE EXACT SAME INCORRECT DRESS. This is unacceptable. I don‚Äôt dare order it a third time, I‚Äôve spent almost $400.00 on what was supposed to be a watch. I pay annually for 2 day shipping. I spend hundreds, if not thousands of dollars a year with ASOS. I am livid."
"October 16, 2019",1,The order I received arrived opened ASOS customer service is atrocious.,"The order I received arrived opened, with the recipe and two items missing, and one item that I did not order in it. The customer service rep said I had to ORDER ANOTHER and send the incorrect item back to be refunded! They should have never taken my money for the items I never received and I should not be responsible to them for the mistakes they made. I opened a case with FedEx even who stated that the package they received came to them in the damaged condition they delivered it. FedEx recommended that the sender simply resend the items and open a case with them. ASOS however does not do that and is in the business of swindling customers. I will probably never order from ASOS ever again."

When I told them I wasn't happy wasting my time running around fixing their mistakes - I was simply still told to return it and no other resolution was given.

Said I need to wait up to 21st for an order I paid next day delivery for. No refund, no  reimbursement or code by way of an apology. The only thing the advisor offered was a refund upon cancellation of my premier subscription. So I lose the subscription I paid for because I needed next day delivery....ASOS you have massively failed.

Assuming the bug would be fixed the day after i tried again and the same issue occurred.i'm surprised by how slow the company is to react to such issues, with all the competition on the market you want your client to be confident when paying through an app, and now i became skeptical about it.it worked well with the web platform though.(just ordered tonight using paypal).Working in software engineering i would take several actions with my PO and address with the dev team  rapidly how to face such issues for the clients.I understand you want to get paid before the order goes through, but  you should validate if the order is successfully sent before charging paypal and not the other way around. (i find that approach creepy), and if the order is not sent through don't allow the payment (something like  that).Anyhow, that's why i'm rating 3 stars my experience, although i think we should have Orders in the main menu and not under My account, beside that i love the dark theme, the videos for the items and the app in its globality.thank you for reading me.Cyril."

"October 15, 2019",1,Horrible customer service and bad stock management,"I am sorry, but I can only provide 1 star. I am very disappointed and hurt - because ASOS used to be a dear friend of mine, but now you really hurt my feelings. Get better please, or I will find someone else. Placed an order which was supposed to arrive on oct 4. I received an email one day after ordering stating that the order had been delayed one day. This was mid week before the weekend. On Oct 8 I still hadn't received anything and the order had not been shipped yet according to my profile. So I contacted ASOS. Only then did I receive notice that my order for no apparent reason had been unsuccessful but I had not been charged with any money(which I had) and the items were still in stock (which they weren't) so I could just go ahead and replace the order. I did so, having to spend more money, because the items that I needed the most, was no longer in stock. After this, I received the money back for the first attempt to order, however (due to exchange rates I guess) I lost around 10GBP on this. Furthermore this also meant that the items that I had ordered in the second attempt I still haven't received as they had even longer delivery time compared to the first attempt. I have been in touch with ASOS customer care about this, and their attitude is really disappointing. We went back and forth about compensation for example in the shape of a complementary express shipment after the failed first attempt - that was not possible due to the fact that I had not had any costs from this failed order and they had informed me of the order being unsuccessful. But this was both untrue, which I made clear. I also made clear that I was dissatisfied. Ultimately I received the cool and short conclusion: ""I'm very sorry for the convenience(yes, CONVENIENCE). Unfortunately we don't offer compensation to our customers""..... OMG!!!!I have never had any complaints to ASOS for all the years that I have been shopping there. But these past few months it gets worse and worse. More often than not items that seem in stock are not in stock, which you won't get notified of until after you have placed and paid for you order. And via e-mail. So if you need a jacket amongst other things and it turns our it was out of stock after the order was placed and paid for, you have to go and make a new order with another jacket - this is both frustrating and straight up stupid. Get your stock management in check - this never used to be a problem!!"
"October 15, 2019",1,Never again,Never again. Terrible customer service. No reply to emails. Took over a month to get a reply and then later for my refund. Don‚Äôt do it.

"October 15, 2019",2,Unhelpful Costumer Service,"Very poor customer service. They were nice so there's that.. But honestly, that was the only saving grace.So, why did I contact Costumer Service in the first place? I tried to complete an order but my payment method got rejected. I went back to the previous web page, tried putting in a different payment method, but when I tried to confirm, the payment was rejected because the item was out of stock (even though Asos reserves the items for one hour when you are finalising your shopping). I spoke with a person nicknamed Summer, explained the situation and asked if it would be possible to check what had happened, for the dress to have gone out of stock. Summer said that she was unable to check anything aside from what was stated in the item's web page (""out of stock"" basically).So then, I asked her if she could speak with someone that could see if the dress I had ordered was maybe in some weird checkout limbo still waiting for my payment. Again she said that she could not do that for me. So then, I asked her if they would get that item back, to which she had no knowledge of either. She simply suggested that I keep refreshing the page and maybe they will have it back in stock. Without any hope, I asked my final question: ""I understand that you can get stock back for multiple reasons such as somebody cancelling an order, or somebody returning an item, but what is usually the time where you get most of your stock back?"". Unsurprisingly, her response was that she doesn't have that information and that she can't ask anyone from a department that does know that info. TL;DR: I contacted ASOS because of a failed order and they were unable to provide any information concerning: Why the item had not been reserved; If the item was still reserved but I simply could not see it; if they would get it back; when does ASOS usually get/update their stock? My question is, what do they know then?"

"October 15, 2019",1,Extremely poor customer service,"Extremely poor customer service. I've had the same problem a lot of other people seem to have. Hermes was late in delivering my order. 'Apparently' they attempted delivery but that was a lie because I was home all day and chose that delivery day for a reason. Anyway ASOS were of no help and kept asking me to wait. As a result my order was delivered 3 daya after I purchased it (and I have paid for the next day delivery service). Because of that delay it had delayed other things for me and I had to order the same pair of trousers again in a bigger size but I could not return the old ones until the 28th day after delivery. ASOS are not satisfied that this meets the returns policy and have refused to offer me a refund and insteas offered me vouchers. Even though I have bought the same item in a bigger size. They have put business before customer satisfaction.This experience have put me off as I do want to shop with a business that does not believe in goodwill gestures. And apparantley they do no have a dedicated complaints depart nor do they have senior managers. Extremely poor, terrible customer service."

I LOVE their clothes and had plans on spending quite a bit of money on their website for my autumn/winter wardrobe but I'll literally never bother again. I've been going in circles between ASOS and MyHermes all morning and no one will give me any answer to the simple question of 'how do I give my entry code to my flat to the MyHermes delivery driver'. MyHermes claimed to have attempted delivery to my flat yesterday but I was home and no one ever buzzed up. Now they're trying to deliver again today but I'm at work. So all I want to do is give my entry code so the parcel can be left at my door (no signature is required). That sounds simple right? This is how Amazon functions. But no one at MyHermes will talk to me because I have an ASOS tracking number, but no one at ASOS will give me any answer as to how I can contact MyHermes to give my entry code. ASOS live chat reps kept sending me back to MyHermes who wont talk to me. The first rep Chelsea gave me a phone number to MyHermes that was literally just a recorded message telling me to check the MyHermes website FAQ or contact them through their contact form (but I can't! It won't accept my tracking number because its from ASOS!). The second ASOS rep Alex was just rude. He ended the chat while I was still typing and dodged all of my questions and kept telling me to contact MyHermes. They literally do not care about their customers.

"October 15, 2019",4,Equal opportunity sizes,"Hello ASOS !, I‚Äôve noticed that you are all about equal opportunity. I think you should pave the way and have incorporate shorter male and females to  model your clothes. Being the largest online retailer you could make an incredible revolution for modeling, branding, while promoting that you don‚Äôt have to be tall to be successful. There are average sizes, plus size, and y‚Äôall. Typically these model sizes exclude small and below. Also, it‚Äôs hard to gauge how a certain set of items will fit when only shown on tall models. Thank you for reading this!"

One with credit card and the other with after pay. I contact your help team and was told I should of cancelled my order straight away and that it was too late to now cancel the order. What annoys me is that I did not know I had ordered 2 dresses as your website was faulty and the women I dealt with was not helpful one bit!!! Also, I‚Äôve tried hoping online to do the ‚Äòchat‚Äô and email option but your website keeps asking to log in, and won‚Äôt function proberly."

"October 15, 2019",1,Slow delivery... parcel left in stupid place so did not receive it... poor customer response times,I placed an order expecting it to arrive before my holiday but after 6 days it still had not arrived. I then returned from holiday and found a slip saying the order was in the green bin - however this was emptied by the bin men while we were away so the package and it‚Äôs contents were thrown away!I am very disappointed at the slow delivery of the package and the fact I could not take the items on holiday. I always thought ASOS tried to deliver in 2-3 days? I still want the products I have ordered however this means I am going to have to wait even longer for re-delivery. I am a regular user of your sight and never usually have these problems. It seems silly to put a parcel inside a bin... why not put it behind etc? I have also been stuck waiting trying to live chat on your sight for over an hour with no luck - so instead went through Facebook messenger - although I still have to wait hours between replies!**Update - on top of this half of the items are now no longer in stock - some of which I have been waiting to come back into stocks for months!! Extremely annoying

If I had written a review a month or so ago, I would likely have given them a higher rating. However, I am completely shocked and upset by how they are treating customers. Their change in returns policy means you receive gift vouchers instead of refunds. Therefore, if you paid via a credit company such as Klarna (which is very popular now) they will not be reimbursed when you return the items.I have contacted ASOS several times and have received awful customer service. In one situation, I was cut off mid sentence and told that it was their new policy, before they then put down the phone.The lack of care for their customers is appalling and changing their policy to ensure customers go into debt is awful. They clearly only care about money."

"October 14, 2019",1,Poor service and response to a complaint,"Really poor service from ASOS regarding a parcel which should have been delivered with NDD and did not arrive 7 days later. Was told by Asos that Hermes had tried to deliver on 3 occasions and the parcel is going back to sender. This is despite stating I was at the address during the delivery slots and the Hermes website updating each day saying there was a delay with my order, NOT that delivery was unsuccessful. Asos have not bothered to acknowledge the inconvenience or offer anything to compensate for this- I was even rejected for a discount code! Even if the fault here lies with the notoriously poor delivery provider that is Hermes, Asos should still take pride in customer service and apologise for any inconvience caused. As a customer who regularly shops with Asos, spends hundreds and hundreds of pounds each year and never complains, I really am disappointed with how I have been dealt with on this occasion."

I ordered a leather purse that smelled like rotten fish, a dress that ended up being this nasty foam material that is HORRIBLE!!! Embarrassingly horrible like I can‚Äôt believe this material is what they make their clothes out of. It reminds me of wall insulation, like Tyco wall insulation !!!

For some reason, I couldn't get the package even though the address is less than 10 minutes from me. I also, couldn't do a pick collection. Instead, I had to redo the entire order and have to wait a week to get my money back. I've had situations like this with Amazon and other online companies and normally they just send it back to the warehouse and put a different delivery address on there. I don't like that I have to redo something that could be fixed very easily. I would understand if the address was over 30 minutes apart from each other. but its a 10-minute difference. and the fact that other online companies can do this and asos can't, I find baffling. I also the guy on the live chat took forever to respond. this could have solved within 20 minutes, 30 minutes tops. Instead, it took ver an hour. They would take 5 to 10 minutes to respond to each question. I have never had such a slow service online before. And how come there is no customer contact phone number. This is a big corporation and there is no phone number. how?"

"October 13, 2019",1,"Lack of information, poor service.","Paid for next day delivery, and have now waited a week for my order. ASOS have passed the buck saying that the fault lies with Hermes as they have not delivered my order and cannot get more information on why. ASOS are unable to compensate as it's not their fault. Having spent a massive amount of money on ASOS throughout the years, I would expect a bit more from them. They do not keep their customer's informed when things go wrong, and it takes a lot of work from customers to get an answer (however I've have found it impossible to actually get anymore information other than ""sorry, theres been an issue"").

I received a message from the courier company in the morning to say they would deliver within two days.

I arrived home to find a card had been pushed through the door and the delivery driver said he left my parcel in a ‚Äòsafe‚Äô place behind the bin (in full view of the street a few feet away). It wasn‚Äôt there. I reported it to ASOS and the delivery company. ASOS have now sent me the very confusing message (below). Hi ‚Ä®‚Ä®Thank you for waiting to hear back from us about your parcel.‚Ä®‚Ä®I've just heard back from the courier and they have suggested that they have requested to have this parcel sent to you, however they cannot guarantee that the depot will receive this request in time to action the return to sender, due to the parcel being very close to the delivery location.‚Ä®‚Ä®If successful, your parcel will be returned to you within the next 3-5 working days.‚Ä®‚Ä®Enjoy your weekend.‚Ä®Best Wishes,‚Ä®ASOS Customer CareI don‚Äôt know what it means.

Kept brushing me off with which sounded like a copy and paste job about 48 hours for the funds to come back. He then decided to close the chat saying he advised all he can for now after I asked him a question less than a minute earlier to please explain if the order hasn't gone through why I have now just received an order confirmation number and email to confirm. Closing a chat on a customer who is complaining, avoiding the questions asked is disgusting. I'm shocked at the level of CS from ASOS. Never had a problem before. Will be forwarding on the transcript as a complaint.I logged back on and spoke to April who was fantastic and is looking into the order for me. How a customer service agent should be."

Why are ASOS not going to look into a repeated problem with their courier? And finally today, your advisor ended the chat, ignoring my questions...basically a final dismissive slap in the face. ASOS, you may as well get rid of your customer service staff and whoever trained them...replace them with an auto reply 'we don't care'...it would be the truth and just as useful."

"October 13, 2019",4,I buy from ASOS (Canada) with confidence.,"ASOS.com (Canada) is probably the single-best retailer web site I have ever encountered.  Usability, searchability, transparency...they are unmatched in the online retail world.  Users can easily find fabric content, plus most clothing and shoes include a video of the item being modelled, along with the model‚Äôs height and size.Shipping is pretty good.  For example, although standard shipping was free, I paid $20 for expedited shipping on my most recent order.  I placed the order October 01, and received it October 03 (UK to Toronto). As a Canadian, my experience has been that ASOS orders elicit the maximum in customs, duty, and tax fees to be paid upon delivery, and are never exempt.  (Additional fees up to 50% of the order total should be expected.) Unfortunately, the 2 pairs of men‚Äôs shoes in my recent order, were not standard sizing.  Thus, I had to submit my first ASOS return.  That was as straightforward and transparent as the purchase process.  ASOS has a system in place to allow the purchase of a flat-rate return label, which routed my package to a local company who, then, handled the return back to ASOS in the UK.  I mailed my return package on October 04, and received an email from Canada Post on October 05, indicating receipt of my return parcel.  I just received a notice from ASOS, October 12, letting me know they‚Äôve submitted a refund for the full amount of my order.  Everything has been very professional and transparent.  I appreciate that.  I buy from ASOS (Canada) with confidence."

"October 12, 2019",1,A Wild. Fricking. Goose. Chase.,"On my life, if I could give 0 stars I would, but TrustPilot won't let me.3 separate times I have tried to order from Asos, and on all 3 occasions, they have failed to meet the minimum standards for customer service.I ordered 2 dresses for a wedding, both of which I ordered at the same time. I paid for next day delivery, but for some reason, the delivery was held with the couriers and I could not get a single answer as to why that was. I ordered the dresses on Thursday to try them on and see which one was better..The dresses arrived the following Monday, which was pointless seeing as the Wedding was on Saturday, and has already passed! After almost a week of arguing with their ""Customer Care"" team, they finally agreed to refund the delivery fees. I guess they redeemed themselves at the last minute.The second time, they had send me emails about offers they were having, so I took a chance on them and decided to order a jump-suit for the Summer. Again... I paid for next day delivery (which to be fair, I should just stop paying because its never really going to arrive on the same day). It turned up a day late, which I guess isn't as bad but I was not pleased. I kid you not when I say I opened the packaging and inside was a size 20 dress that had what looked like the Botanical Gardens spewed all over it. I ordered a light pink jumpsuit in a size 14 and this is what I got. Some of you might think i'm exaggerating, I promise you I have screenshots of my order and photos of what I received. Again.. had to send it back and ask for a full refund because they didn't actually have the jumpsuit I wanted in stock.I guess thats what they do? Just send any random item in place of what a customer has actually ordered. This third time, I ordered a specific winter jacket, to be fair it wasn't for me. It was a gift for someone who had been trying to find something in that style and unfortunately, Asos seemed to be the ONLY site online anywhere that did this kind of style. I sucked it up and just went ahead with it, only to be sent on some crazy wild goose chase. AGAIN.. I paid for next day delivery (seriously.. I'm just never going to bother with NDD again. You'd think I would have learned!)I wake up to a text message saying that my order will be delivered between the hours of 9:00am and 10:00am.. and literally a few minutes later, they send me another message saying that the delivery has been delayed and they'll try and deliver another time in the week. Excuse me? Another time in the week? At this point, I was just speechless..I called the ""Customer Care"" team, and the guy on the phone said there was literally nothing he could do. He kinda sounded like he was new? So I wasn't going to go crazy at him for something I could not blame him for directly.. wouldn't be fair. But seriously.. I tried to contact the couriers and apparently they don't have call services if you order through another company. Ha okay.I spent time on the phone calling another department, speaking to other members of their team and lastly was just told that there simply is nothing they can do. This is supposed to be a gift Im going to give to someone, that I'm supposed to take with me on a flight that is leaving today... the day on which it is supposed to arrive. Now I dont care about the whole ""you should have ordered ahead of time to avoid this situation"".. what the hell is next day delivery for then mate? Goodness sake..So, now I'm writing this in the car on my way to the airport.. and after all that conundrum.. spending hours on the phone, trying to sort out another delivery location which isn't easy especially if the couriers do not answer and with Asos not wanting to assist you any further... I open the door to leave for the Airport to catch my flight (which im running late for because I had to try and fix their mistake.. Thanks Asos) I open the door.. and behold.. a Hermes Delivery driver with my order. A Wild. Fricking. Goose. Chase.Your products might be good Asos, but your service is an abomination. You clearly only care about when that money hits your accounts, but aren't concerned when the good will hit out doorsteps."
"October 12, 2019",1,if I could give less that 1 star I would,"The service from agent#1 I received did not answer any of the questions I had. I said the problem was that Hermes had ‚Äòattempted‚Äò to deliver my parcel twice when I was in the building and had just left without attempting to contact me. Therefore, if they tried to deliver tomorrow with me there, there still wouldn‚Äôt be a change and I wouldn‚Äôt get my parcel. I found this unacceptable and also wanted to the parcel company to call me when they couldn‚Äôt get into the building so I could get my parcel. All I got were canned answers saying they would deliver next day, repeating the same thing again and again and outright ignoring the issue I was outlining. When I then tried to talk to someone else because this agent clearly didn‚Äôt understand my problem, I was told I wasn‚Äôt allowed to. I then said I wanted the order cancelled and refunded as I clearly wasn‚Äôt receiving the items and was told I couldn‚Äôt do this either. I then asked where I could complain to and was told only to the agent. There were no apologies, no understanding and it was clear the agent did not want to do anything to help. This was after talking to an agent#2 earlier who I also described the situation to and he said he couldn‚Äôt investigate until the end of the day even though I sent them a screenshot of the information I got from Hermes saying they won‚Äôt deliver until the next day because they attempted delivery again. Therefore I still wouldn‚Äôt be able to get Hermes to call me before delivery and was destined to again, get an ‚Äòattempted‚Äô delivery. I was typing my reply to this and got told that they had given me all the advice they knew and closed the chat before I could reply. I am shocked and appalled and cannot believe this is the level of service and even respect given to customers. I will not be shopping here and ASOS really need to re-evaluate the staff and level of service they provide."

The only option to get the shoes on time for an event was the $19 premier shipping subscription. The wrong size was shipped again. Refunds were issued for the shoes, but not the shipping charges on either order. I had to spend at least 45 min chatting online with people to get my money back. They eventually refunded the shipping charges, but not before telling me that no one authorized me to add the $19 shipping charge, and that I should have used the $7.99 express shipping, which was not even an option. The whole experience was frustrating and disappointing. I will need to check my account for the next 2 weeks to make sure the money is actually returned. I was close to just calling my credit card company to dispute the charges and report them for fraud."

When I reported to ASOS that I didn't receive my order in 2 days, I was told that they couldn't issue a refund until after 13 days had past (although FedEx already reported that the package was undeliverable because the parcel was empty). I contacted ASOS after 13 days and then I was told that someone would email me within 24 hours. I'm beyond frustrated with all of the back and forth. It's never been this hard for a shipping issue to be resolved -RIDICULOUS!"
"October 11, 2019",1,Appalling!!!!,"Appalling. My order arrived damaged. I had to spend my time, effort and money travelling to the post office to send it back. I raised a complaint. 11 days later I hadn‚Äôt received any form of response. I rang up. Spoke to Demi who I had to explain my complaint to 3 times, whilst she had my email on the screen, because she wouldn‚Äôt listen to me. When she continued asking questions I‚Äôd answered 3 times and was on the screen in front of her, I said ‚ÄòI‚Äôve already told you‚Äô to which she said ‚Äòthere‚Äôs no need to be rude‚Äô. Actually hilarious. How does this company even operate? Tonight I spoke to the ‚Äòmost senior‚Äô person in the escalations team, Fraser, who offered me 15% off my next order as a ‚Äògoodwill‚Äô gesture. When I told him that I could up to 20% off with my student code, he told me that was ‚Äòmy opinion‚Äô. When I told him it‚Äôs not an opinion, it‚Äôs factual, he told me it wasn‚Äôt because they ‚Äòonly do promotions occasionally‚Äô. But it‚Äôs apparently not a fact!! Again, hilarious. Safe to say I declined that offer, which is apparently the ‚Äòbest they can do‚Äô as they don‚Äôt offer monetary compensation. This whole company seems to be completely deluded. I‚Äôve been ripped off, ignored, insulted, had my intelligence questioned, and still no one there gives one. AVOID!!!"
"October 11, 2019",5,Quick service,ASOS did an incorrect refund on the something I've ordered online. But they were quick on helping with my issue. I recommend buying their shoes because they have leather options to pick from. I gave one for my little sister and she loves it!
"October 11, 2019",5,Customer Service is great!,"Shopping at ASOS is really simple and fuss-free. Occasionally, I have issues with delivery but this can be simply solved by emailing or chatting live with the customer care team. Their replies are very prompt and clear. I had an absolutely pleasant time chatting with Anita regarding my delivery issue and she was able to provide a solution swiftly and very politely. It has truly been a wonderful experience shopping on ASOS and I would recommend it for everyone."

I was told it was too late to cancel my order and that they could not honor the promo code. I have spent thousands of dollars with ASOS and have been a customer with them for years, but I don't think I can justify the terrible customer service I continue to receive whenever there is an issue. I will not be buying from them again, and will file my second complaint with the Better Business Bureau."

There is no telephone number to ASOS nor the courier service Hermes.

"October 11, 2019",3,Re-introduce return and refund confirmation emails!,"When I first began buying from ASOS some years ago the process of returning and receiving confirmation of refunds was excellent as ASOS emailed every time a return had been received and informed me of the refund to my card.However in recent months this has changed and ASOS no longer inform the customer that either the return has been received, or a refund authorised.  I now have to check my proof of postage to see when it was received by ASOS and then send an email to customer service with the order number and request confirmation of refund.  This lessens the quality of the shopping experience and is annoying.  I am much less likely to now recommend ASOS shopping to friends."

It's very rare I receive the items I order, next day. It's also incredibly rare that I get informed my items will be arriving late. Their policies and regulations are exhausting and lack of incentive to keep long term customers is why I won't be renewing my premier membership (along with the increase of price)."

After three changes of delivery time, the notification was to try the following day (the 3rd) for updates. The system has not been updated since the 2nd (even though ASOS says it was updated on the 3rd but that does not show on my tracking or the link they sent). They took payment on 29th September and they say I now have to wait until 14th October to even apply for a refund.

Still waiting on an outcome."
"October 11, 2019",1,Absolutely terrible customer service,"Absolutely terrible customer service, I'm sure it's policy and not the fault of the individual delivering the customer care but it's the worst of the worst. My item was never delivered despite Hermes confirming delivery on the 4th October and my item being marked 'Item delivered, hope you love it' on my ASOS account. I approached customer services with missing item and instead of ""I'm sorry for you inconvenience"", I was just hit with a load of questions. I was then told that it hadn't been delivered and Hermes would make 3 attempts to deliver, I called again 3 days later and was told it would be delivered and I need to give it until end of day 10th Oct. On the 11th October, I called to tell ASOS CS the inevitable, that it hadn't been delivered and their response was ""it was delivered on the 4th October, have you checked everywhere at the address"". I don't think I even need to write my response, I'll leave that to your imagination! As it stands, I still don't have my item, nor do I have a refund but thankfully I've been told it's been passed onto a 'specialist team'. I will never use ASOS again, and recommend you go straight to the brand for your item - avoid ASOS."

This is the 2nd time I've ordered and that there are problems with delivery! It takes 3 weeks instead of the 5 days Asos said it would take. Very dissapointed. Would not order on Asos again just because of that. Back to Zalando.

Hermes send me an email saying my parcel will be wirh me between 5 and 7pm. And nothing no knock on the door no parcel no nothing. I track the parcel and it says there has been a delay. So the next day I get another email from hermes I make sure I'm in. Again it was between 5 and 7pm and nothing no knock no one turns up no parcel. I then contact asos customer service. Who tell me to wait until the 14 of October. I said but I've paid for next day delivery I shouldn't have to wait for 7 days. And I needed the clothes for the 8th of October. They just said you've got to wait until the 14th.so yesterday the 10th I get another email from hermes my parcel will be delivered again. Between 5 and 7pm. I wait in once again 7 o'clock comes and nothing. So I track the parcel to read it saying they have attempted to deliver the parcel 3 times and there sending it back to the sender. They haven't knocked once not once. They haven't even pulled up out the front of my house let alone knocked. I then contact asos once again. Saying how bad this is and I'm disgusted. They email back saying they have checked and it is going back to the warehouse. And they will refund me within 10 days and that's it. No sorry no nothing I will not be ordering through asos again. Hermes are useless and asos customer service are useless. I never write reviews but this is just a terrible service

The process was very easy and the prices seem very cheap!I decided to read the reviews (which as always are of people moaning), however my experience was nothing but simple. I saw people blame ASOS for delivery issues when they should have contacted the company which was delivering it. I also noticed that people couldn't seem to read the sizes and blame ASOS for custom costs when they should have been aware themselves... Most common of all is of people buying clothes a day before they need them and moan that it hadn't arrived.. how about plan in advance.My delivery arrived before the time specified, and the quality of the items was good especially for what I've pay for it. Overall I am happy with the experience and would use them again."

Noone actually bothering to properly look into it. They also claim they cant contact the courier and suggesting I should!Worst customer service I've received in a long time. Been ordering from them for over 10 years, wont bother again."

All they could say is if I‚Äôm on holiday and unable to collect I will get a refund- not helpful when I was given a gift card for them that I will then have to use again and go through this again! This is my first experience using them so won‚Äôt be back.

I am positive the codes were it there and attached to my receipt. However, if you back into the order history and details it switches it to standard delivery and extends the dates.

Firstly, I purchased the premium delivery, in which I expect my delivery to therefore arrive the next day... & it didn't.I contacted DPD as I defended Asos saying that this wasn't their problem, for DPD to tell me that the barcode label was scratched so they sent it to the wrong sorting office.I then am told to contact Asos, as this is the only way I'd be able to receive some type of help.Upon contacting Asos, they proceed to tell me that these things happen, but I've now read multiple reviews where similar things have happened to other customers which makes me really question the ""Premium delivery"". I understand that it states, if high periods of time, this can mean a delay in the postage however, I was told there's ""a scratch on the barcode"" which hence, the slow delivery (as mentioned sent to the wrong sorting office.)I've now been in contact with Graham, for well over an hour, and have been told that I can have a refund for the premium delivery but this will no longer commence (despite how much I've been put out). Since, I decided to then state I'd like a refund for everything and wish for DPD not to deliver so I've now been told this can take a total of 17 days for a refund to actually come through.I'm honestly really disappointed.The items I've purchased were meant to be a birthday present, very much an addition and last minute (admittedly my fault) but when spending lots of money and expecting a service to find it's not meeting ts expectations is just really frustrating.I will no longer be shopping with Asos, despite the 'complimentary 10% discount voucher'. It's not worth the hassle.P.S Graham has tried to be really helpful and spent ages with me but I feel as though what they're trained at Asos isn't to a good enough standard. With the situation though, Graham - thank you for your patience and time."

They don't investigate your issue, they don't followup with the shipper. I chatted with a customer service Rep three times and each time it was like I never called before. I found out more about what happened with my package by speaking with the shipper. It's like they don't contact the shipper, they wait for the shipper to contact them. I had Premier Deliver and it's been 11 days since my package shipped. Now I have no package, the items are now out of stock!! NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER!!!"

Tried every customer service channel but couldn't get through to anyone real. Pathetic.So, more in hope than expectation, I used the ASOS web chat. Within three minutes Kirsti had contacted Yodel, got an investigation raised, and instructed tomorrow's driver to call me as they're dropping the parcel off. All while being thoroughly charming, reassuring and classy. The gulf between ASOS and Yodel is astonishing. They've literally done their customer service for them.

Asked several times how I can get a refund but was ignored each time. Order was placed 8 days ago, still no idea what is happening. Truly awful experience, will be avoiding using ASOS in the future which is a shame as it used to be so much better and never had a single problem.Customer service that can't tell you anything, might as well be BOTS.

I had to reach out to the customer services team who in turn seemed extremely confrontational and adamant about waiting for the maximum possible time(7 days) before communicating with them as their warehouse needs that much time to scan the parcel. What a waste of my time that is. First I have to connect with them and then wait for another few days till they can confirm that a return has been initiated! Surely sending a confirmation of return is not that hard.

This is extremely frustrating and I have received nothing to compensate for this inconvenience.

Recently, I spent nearly three hundred dollars with them and they sent out the wrong item and neglected to give me the one item I needed immediately. They do nothing to make things better, just tell you to return the items. There is no apology for them making such a mistake, nor do they try to get the right item out immediately.

The customer service team member asked me if I checked a standard list of places to confirm the parcel was delivered but been misplaced. Which I confirmed the parcel was not there, -after checking usual places they leave my parcels - neighbours, on the open porch (for someone to easily steal) and the bins (yes - my black foul smelling rubbish bins). They then assured me they would pass this on to the relevant customer service team and should get a response 48 hours later.A week and a half later - no response.Secondly, I email the customer service team directly explaining my dilemma and lack of response and that I would like a refund. Their response is that my item has been returned back to them and for me to confirm if the parcel had been delivered, but been misplaced. To which I (again) informed them that I had not received it and the parcel could not have been returned as I had not received it.I get a response a couple of days later - third time lucky? No. Again they ask me to confirm if I have checked all the relevant places the parcel could be.Have I received a refund yet? No."

Probably the 4 time I've had to contact them in regards to my order and it's past the joke now. The order was never received- Wasn't explained as to why (this was next day and I had to chase/ check the delivery tracker MYSELF to be told 5 days later it's being sent back to the retailer).Then having to chase this up AGAIN I received a response saying it has arrived there....I was only refunded ¬£30 of a ¬£81.99 order. I was told that these are probably being processed individually but this is still no excuse for such terrible service & almost a week of waiting for the funds to be put back into my account & almost 2 weeks since originally making this next day order!!This is the worse service I've had from ASOS. I definitely won't be returning to use the service or membership for next day.  I'm now out of pocket for an order I never even received!

"October 09, 2019",1,Apparently the only way to complain,"I generally like ASOS and am a member of their VIP next-day delivery service. I recently ordered my standard foundation on this service, when they had a 25% off offer on. When it arrived, they had sent the wrong shade so I sent it back, requesting a replacement. Before I did this, I checked with online chat that they would be able to just send me the correct one, next day delivery, without charging any extra (the deal had expired). They assured me it was fine. When I sent it back, they refunded the purchase instead. By then, it was a week after I ordered the foundation (which I had paid to get next day delivery for!) and I just wanted them to be able to send me the product back again, as it was the same price. The online chat agent said he wasn't able to help and would escalate to a colleague who would get it touch. Nearly a week later and I still haven't heard anything. A new online chat agent has told me that was bad advice, and actually I need to reorder the product and then they will issue a 25% refund. LUDICROUSLY when I said I wanted to raise the bad advice and delay in getting my product as a complaint about the service, they told me they don't have a complaints department, and the only way to do it is leave a negative review online and then someone will get on touch with me. This one star review feels like overkill, but I am following instructions."

"October 09, 2019",1,Awful customer care,"Awful customer care, I had asked for an exchange on 2 coats, however they were discounted at the time. Asos didn't provide an exchange and said it could be due to them being out of stock. This is untrue as I had been keeping an eye on them and they were in stock! Instead I was advised to repurchase them and now they will cost me ¬£40 more now than they did at the time I asked for an exchange. Had asos just exchanged them as requested this wouldn't have been a problem. I suggest asos employs people that know how to read a simple returns form!"

I spoke to customer service who said there was an error on the page and if I bought them at full price I'd be refunded the difference. I agreed to it and bought them. I pay for premier delivery yet the order never showed. When it finally arrived the following day, the packaging was ripped open and the shoes were missing. The delivery driver told me to refuse the order. I got on to customer service again. They told me that I had to accept it and then return it. I knew this wasnt right as I'd be liable for the missing shoes. I told them I didnt wanna full refund I just wanted my shoes and the partial refund. They told me this was misinformation and wouldn't get the partial refund. I decided I wanted a full refund as they werent going to honour what they had told me. The same delivery continued to come to me for another 2 days after this, to which I refused it. A week and a half later I recieved the email about my refund. They had only refunded me for the t shirts. I spoke to customer service again who said they will look into it for me. Terrible service, no one seems to know what is happening and ultimately I've missed out on some dope shoes because asos cant keep there promise. Fuming."

I ordered a large order of clothes, which 2 weeks later had still not turned up. This is annoying as it is. I then get an email saying that the package will never turn up as it was damaged in transit so has been returned to their depot.But here's the crazy. Despite never delivering my clothes, they now say I have to wait 7 days for the items to be processed by them, then 10 days to issue a refund. But they know they have never delivered the items to me!!!So they will have had my hard earned cash for over a month, and it's all their fault. Why can't you just refund me straight away now you know the package will never turn up.Very unhappy."

As this is the 4 times it has happened I asked to put a formal complaint in but the lady on the other end of the chat fobbed me off and didn‚Äôt want to help me. Very poor customer service. Apparently if I write a review on here that is when a complaint is picked up but as you can imagine by this point I am very frustrated, especially when it could have been resolved in the first instance on the chat system.

I think it is really unsatisfying not to get the full amount back when it is asos who made the mistake.I understand you lose the shipping money if you made a mistake yourself or can't fit it, but when it is asos whom sends a defective or wrong item, you should get the full amount refunded. After sending a complain to customer service they will refund my shipping money also, so that is good."

Not only was the live chat option not working at first, but once I was finally able to get into contact with a ""Live Chat Agent"", they basically told me there was nothing they could do. They told me that they are seeing that my package should be delivered between 2 weeks and a full month after I ordered the jacket. When I asked to cancel my order and refund my purchase, they told me that I only had an hour after my order was placed to cancel my order and that they can do anything at this point. The customer support upon further questioning and pressing began getting short with me and eventually resorted to sending the same message over and over, leading to a brick wall."

Having to jump through the hops of reporting a package stolen to police and UPS is already hard enough.  Being unable to proceed with out going to your post office, which has nothing to do with packages that being delivered by private courier and not in cooperation with the local post office is a waste of time and an unnecessary step.  Each country does things differently, and customer service should have the cultural competence to do understand that.  I am very disappointed by this experience."
"October 09, 2019",1,Delivery,Usually spot on with deliveries and timing but since Hermes now seem to be delivering the majority of the items now the standards have dropped dramatically.

I placed an order when they had a special 25% off for students. I had to return some of the order but wanted to exchange a pair of trainers for a different size. Today, I had everything refunded, including the trainers. I contacted ASOS through the chat facility on their website about getting the correct size sent out instead of having to buy them again (and losing the 25% discount). The person behind the chat ""Lydia"" didn't even care, just basically said tough, keep an eye out for another discount and buy them again. Not even an apology about misreading the returns note, just came out as quite rude. I have been a customer of ASOS for probably about 10 years and pay for premium delivery. Ok, I am not the biggest buyer, but 90% of the clothes I buy are through ASOS and this just shows how much they actually care. Quite sad really, but I will not be buying from ASOS again.."

"October 08, 2019",2,A total mess,"There are so many things wrong with this site I don‚Äôt even know where to start...I was looking to buy a pair of the white Nike Shox TL sneakers (worth $270 AUD) and found them on ASOS reduced to $204 listed as ‚ÄúNike white Shox Total Sneakers‚Äù ...really? Aren‚Äôt they supposed to be an English company?I selected my size (US 8.5) since the size guide indicated ‚ÄúWomen‚Äù even though the foot measurements made no sense because I checked and my foot is not 27cm... but I decided to test my luck and order them anyway while they were on sale. I continued browsing the other Shox and I see that they‚Äôve got the exact same shoes listed as ‚ÄúNike Shox TL sneakers in white‚Äù (so basically exactly the same shoes just with a more coherent title) with the size guide indicated ‚ÄùMen‚Äù, but with completely different size conversions. Now I‚Äôm even more confused. Since I‚Äôve had this exact same problem twice with ASOS before (confusing and inconsistent shoe size conversions) I just gathered that the shoes were unisex and I had actually ordered a men‚Äôs 8.5 just advertised for women, so I went and ordered another 7 and a 7.5 from the same listing as I had no idea what I was going to receive.I had already initiated a return for the 8.5 and received them today, and they did in fact turn out to be women‚Äôs. They fit, but there was a yellow STAIN on the top of the right shoe. I checked the listing again to place a new order and now they‚Äôre back up to $273?! The shadiness and inconsistency of this site is astounding.I had a look at the size guide again and finally worked out that the foot measurements only applied to UK SIZES, (which wasn‚Äôt stated on the chart) even though you‚Äôre ordering in US. So not only are their size guides excruciatingly confusing and disorganised, leading you to order multiple sizes, they‚Äôll go ahead and send you a used, damaged product!I‚Äôm returning all 3 of them, and I won‚Äôt bother trying to arrange an exchange for the stained pair or placing another order. I‚Äôll just be going straight to Nike. Even though ASOS have a good range of sneakers, their size guides and general website is a mess and their sales are a scam. I definitely won‚Äôt be buying from them again. The only good thing is they‚Äôve already refunded me for the first pair. But seriously, don‚Äôt waste your time."

I chat with a representative that informs me there is no order or transaction. I send screenshots of my account being debited and all they can tell me is that I will be refunded in 10 days which was not what I wanted to hear since I ordered with express delivery to ensure I get it this week. The representative then said I could order another pair while waiting (because I have money to blow), and when I look, there is no longer a size 14. He could not do anything to help make this major inconvenience a little better and also told me he couldn‚Äôt find anything similar to what I originally ordered. There was nothing he could do for me, not even a discount on a future order (not surprised). This is actually pretty upsetting and I don‚Äôt even know for sure that I will get my refund especially when they do not even see any transaction on file...I will be contacting my bank and I won‚Äôt waste my time on this website again."

It also looks like the size I would need is out of stock, so I won't be able to wear the shoe at all.Remains to be seen what happens with the missing item.

"October 07, 2019",1,Non delivery and terrible service,"Ordered some shoes on the 23rd September and paid for next day delivery. The shoes never arrived. Spoke with ASOS via chat on the 25th September and was told I had to wait until the 30th until something could be done. Not good enough but ok. Went away on the 30th, came back on the 4th. Still no shoes. Messages ASOS, waited 24 hours for a reply saying they‚Äôd look into it and get back to me within 24 hours. Reply states that they‚Äôre still looking into it and will respond within 24-48 hours. Totally unacceptable so I asked them just to cancel the order and refund the money. No response until now (14 days since next day order placed) which states there was an IT issue which needs to be looked into and it will be a further 24 hours for an update. How is it possible to treat customers like this? I will never use ASOS again and suggest they are avoided like the plague!"

But ASOS are unsure why? Ridiculous! It's now going to be delivered tomorrow which is incoinvent as I have a hospital app. And chances it will come whilst I am out at 99%. That also means having to wait another day so I can collect from the depot. Not only that, I've just had my tonsils out and am not meant to leave the house due to catching an infection but I guess I'll have to take that risk because Yodel cant deliver a simple parcel. The last time I ordered from ASOS and Yodel delivered, two of my parcels worth ¬£200+ went missing!!! Really disappointed with this service. I wont be using ASOS again."

My order did not arrive (at all) yet their website said it had been dispatched and was still on the way. I had to call the delivery company who informed me that they had never received the order. Called ASOS back who 'looked in to it' and explained that the delivery label had been damaged and so the order returned to them. They had refunded my PayPal account (not notified of this) and asked me to start the order from scratch (several items). I then had to pay for next day delivery so that this birthday gift arrived on time.At no point did ASOS contact me to explain what had happened. At no point did they apologise for the waste of time and several phone calls I had to make. I emailed them and asked for someone to call me - with the subject of the email being very clear 'COMPLAINT'. At no point has ASOS customer services attempted to contact me to discuss this. I will never order from them again.

"October 07, 2019",1,"Bye, Bye Asos was a great first experience with you!","Oh dear, oh dear Asos. What to say? Asos refund and exchange policy went right out the window with me, you want to exchange your shoes? Right, so they leave you a sheet to fill in with your return details, done. They promise to keep you updated on when they receive the returned item and when the exchanged one will be dispatched. Absolutely ZERO EMAILS, I didn't even know I was given a refund until two weeks later when I took it upon myself to find out where my exchanged shoes where. Guess where they were? Out of stock, and guess what? I WASN'T TOLD ANYTHING ABOUT IT! (no email in my spam folder either) so, I've been waiting for my lovely ¬£30 shoes with express delivery for well over a month now, no contact, no information unless you personally go out of your way to chat with them which is also a fairly sad experience as there is minimum customer service skills present. Anyway, after my chat with them, I went to TKK MAXX and got two pairs of just as lovely shoes for only ¬£22 :)"

Advise to ASOS don't offer a service you can not fulfil especially when it's being paid for. Note to customers DO NOT pay for premier delivery complete and utter waste of time and money. Apparently 5 days for delivery when it's meant to next day is completely acceptable! Well that's if it turns up it hasn't yet!!
"October 07, 2019",1,WORST SERVICE,"I ordered something 16 days ago. Did NOT get the package. They charge me $20 for Premium shipping .Package was damaged according to tracking. So I contacted them and they said they are sending another one. Never got it, never updated the tracking. I contacted them again and they say ""Sorry here is your refund"".Did not get the suit.Refund is an easy way out. (What about my event that I needed a suit ?) ; 16 days wasted; and now I have to go out and buy a new one 2 days before the event. No time to for adjustments on the suit.Worst part is that they did not have the decency to let me know it was damaged, the second shipment was NOT sent. They would have kept their mouth shut and took my money if I did not contact them. Note that I have been a loyal customer to them and bought over $1500 worth of clothing from them."
"October 07, 2019",1,ASOS customer service is beyond‚Ä¶,"ASOS customer service is beyond terrible. Their agents have no real desire to resolve your complaint and instead copy and paste scripts in response instead of actually trying to resolve your complaint. I have just spent over 20mins on their online chat complaining about an order that was supposed to have been received the next day (I pay for premier delivery) and delivered by HERMES but never came until the day after, and I might as well have been chatting with a robot.APPALLING!"

I will never shop with them again; clearly customer service isn't one of their priorities.

Thought i would try and get back some of the money i pay for the 'Premier delivery service' and you just quote me T&C's saying i have had the service over a month and it cannot be cancelled. Also if you read them carefully it also says that they will not held responsible for late deliveries during sale periods.No wonder your share price has been cut in half over the last 12 months if you cant even get your deliveries right.

"October 07, 2019",5,Taking Care Of Customers When The Brands They Stock Fails Customers,"I recently purchased a skirt from Kings Of Indigo via ASOS. A crucial button on the denim skirt fell off rendering the whole skirt unusable. The spare button wasn't included in this particular product even when their other products have them. I contacted KOI directly in hopes to salvage this skirt I had come to love and was let down by them. You would think a brand all about sustainability would understand the right to repair and keep a couple of spare denim buttons or at least suggested an alternative. They just gave me a ""Sorry we can't help you"" as the final point of the support. I contacted ASOS about this and it turns I was well within the returns period. I will very likely return it at the risk of never getting a replacement for this denim skirt I have come to love as it was bought on sale. Additionally, there is also a risk it will end up in a landfill after being returned. So this brand I bought based on its sustainability cred has just majorly let me down. But thank you ASOS support for giving me an option for recourse."
"October 07, 2019",1,not happy,They were terrible when I asked for an exchange as they gave me a refund instead and when I contacted them about this problem they just kept telling me there was nothing I could do about this even though I could now not use my discount so if I were to reorder it would cost a lot more.

"October 07, 2019",1,I have shopped from ASOS for many years‚Ä¶,"I have shopped from ASOS for many years and I always have a few orders that come in and go back. Finding clothes that fit in brick and mortar shops are a little stressful as a size 16/18, so ordering from ASOS has been a fantastic way for me to try out clothes. I often order two sizes of each item and I keep one. Shopping is a very easy going process, returns are a breeze and I never ever had a major issue until today.ASOS almost always have some discount code so in my last order I used one ($70 off a $250 order) as usual and I partially returned the order after keeping an item. I was surprised that I was refunded the order minus the full price of the item I kept. Turns out, if you use a discount code when you place an order and decide to return some things from that order, the items you keep automatically revert to full price if you fall below ""minimum spend"". This must be a new policy as I bought and returned so many things over the years using these codes and never have i been charged full price because i haven't met ""the minimum spend"". Customer service advised me ""to read ""terms and conditions"" every time i use a discount code"".Ain't nobody got time for that. ASOS has made shopping super easy for Australian consumers in the past few years and easy returns are a big part of that. If returning orders are not straightforward anymore, they need to be explicit about this, and I don't mind some fine print about a discount code. I am not going to shop from ASOS after this as I cannot trust the return process."

I assumed like all orders I would get a slip in the mailbox to collect my parcel from Australia Post. Having paid for express post apparently this service is not available to me??? It is silly that this service is, however, available for standard delivery. She could have been more understanding.

First of all i ordered some serums that were packed in a paper bag so 2 bottles were smashed. I had to continuously contact them for my refund.  I also returned a jumper overca moth ago and after numerous emails to them still have not received my refund. Didn't even get a confirmation email to say they received my return! Keep being told i have to wait longer. I won't be buying from them again. Appalling !!
"October 05, 2019",1,Missing delivery and ASOS have been useless,Ordered my delivery 9 days ago and ASOS have been no help.

Unfortunately courier companies like Hermes let ASOS down as they really are terrible and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if most of the customer service ASOS staff deal with  are a result of Hermes poor service.

The clothes are good quality for the price too."

"October 05, 2019",5,I love ASOS,"I was looking for ASOS product reviews and found this website. I do not understand all the hate. Yeah they have some odd items, but a lot of their stuff is really cool, and the sales are frequent and make it easy to save on unique stuff. ASOS is the site I use the most to shop online mostly because they offer free shipping on orders of $50+ and free return shipping, so you have nothing to lose in trying stuff out. I live in the states and have never waited more than a few days for a package. For this reason I don't pay for premium shipping. I also do not order clothes 2 days before I need them, so maybe that is why it is not an issue for me. I have never had a problem getting refunds for items I return. You have A MONTH to decide on things. If you return them after trying them on, but they are in unworn condition (tags on, no stains, rips, perfume, etc), there is no hassle in getting your money back. The only thing I wish they offered is customer reviews on products, although their style guide is pretty accurate if you are honest about your measurements. Anytime I have talked to customer service about anything they have been friendly and helpful. Just one girl's opinion, but these reviews do not reflect my experience with ASOS at all."

I've contacted their customer ""service"" team ( the term ""service"" is used very lightly here) to ask where my parcel is and have been advised to wait an addition 27 days (seems like a rather arbitrary number) before contacting them again to investigate this further. They send a generic email and refuse to actually provide any service in regards to my issue.  They are horrible to deal with as a retailer.  I very regularly shop online and have NEVER before been faced with such indifference in dealing with a problem from any other retailer.   And just to note...I have never written a bad review about any retailer before....I'm not the type....but this lack of service was astounding!!!!!"

She offered no further solution and was in fact curt and dismissive. I will never use ASOS again and will urge all of my friends and family not to either.

I asked for an exchange instead of this I was given a ¬£115 voucher (the coat coat ¬£135 I originally had a ¬£20 discount). The coat was still in stock so I re ordered it but Asos were reluctant to offer me the same ¬£20 discount and didn‚Äôt  exchange as I told I could request. It leaves me to think that they do this deliberately to gain an additional ¬£20. The second coat arrived (exactly the same product) with no tags. I wore it once and noticed it smelt of someone else‚Äôs perfume. When I took the coat off I noticed this one was also faulty!!! Do they not check the items they send out?? I have been in contact on the live chat multiple times and by email. I‚Äôve spoken to over 8 people at Asos (the same person never replies to the email thread). All as unhelpful as each other. I‚Äôve been told different things each time I‚Äôve had a reply. One person told me I should have had a refund to my card as the item was faulty not a voucher. I‚Äôve now received another voucher for the second faulty coat but this is only for ¬£109.05?!? They have then tried to tell me that the ¬£6.95 reduction is for next day delivery despite me already paying for this with my card?!?!? Which I can prove. It‚Äôs an absolute joke and I am so angry!! I‚Äôve been on the live chat tonight & they have told me yet again that they had read through my previous chats...and have no come the conclusion that I should have been given a refund. This has been going on since the beginning of September it‚Äôs now been passed to the ‚Äúspecialist team‚Äù which has apparently happened before. Literally have no faith in them, it‚Äôs ridiculous!! Better off ordering from the brand directly!"

I had a terrible customer experience both with the product i ordered and the customer service i received. I ordered a pair of backless white faux leather mules in a US size 8. The shoes i received are labelled a size 8 and are easily three sizes too big. They are absolutely not a standard US size 8. I have worn this size my entire adult life and never experienced this issue. The ASOS rep i dealt with through the chat was not helpful told me there was nothing he could do. Which means i am now going to have to pay $22.50 in shipping to send back a faulty product that is not at all what was advertised. It is going to cost me, the consumer money to deal with your terrible product. I emailed the support email and have heard nothing back in over 5 days. I reached out on social and again nothing.

Watch out for this company.
"October 04, 2019",1,Your customer service is the worst,Your customer service is the worst. I received the wrong pair of shoes and was told to return them without any resolvment of the issue of receving the wrong pair of shoes. I ask of the shoes I order where in stock and when will I receive them if I send the incorrect shoes back. Was told that they don't know and if the shoes are not in stock than I will receive an refund. I told the chat rep. That don't want a refund I want the shoes that I ordered. Asked the chat rep. Kate if the shoes were in stock and was told no they were not. So I'm like if I didn't ask you were not going  tell me which means that if I send these shoes back I'll be waiting forever for my shoes or receive my refund in a month from now. I asked to be escalated to high authority and was told that she can not escalate the issue. This is unacceptable to not have a customer service line to speak with someone but to also have an only chat line in which they are not giving the customer 100% customer service for issues that were not of there fault but of ASOS.I've been a customer of ASOS for 3-4 years and love ordering items because you will never find here in the US. But today you have lost a customer and I will tell my friend about this experience and have them to order somewhere else.

I was told that my account had had suspicious activity and I would need to change my password and advise them when I have done so and they would kindly unblock my account. I did so straight away and received a standard automatic message advising they had received my email. The next day I received an email advising the same message, to change my password. I advised I had done so and reiterated my problem, but to look at past correspondence so that they can see and unblock my account. I receive an email back a few days later (by the sounds of it not even bothering to look at the whole story!) advising they have known known issues for logging in. Try another PC or use my mobile. And then kindly asked me to leave a review of my experience!! I replied AGAIN advising my situation and asking them to look back and see I have followed their instructions but I am just going round in circles. Surprise surprise; a few days later I receive an email apologising for issues and to reset my password and to email back advising I have done so. THE EXACT WORD FOR WORD EMAIL TEMPLATE. By the time of writing this, I have been on holiday and been back without anything being sorted. The customer care team are incompetent and careless!

I speak to customer service via chat where I am told that a price adjustment cannot be created for me since there are no exchanges in the US.I find that extremely unfair. I have already given my business and intended to again, but rather than good customer service ASOS is only about getting money.Where is the customer loyalty in forcing me to pay extra for an item? Asos has cute styles which is the only reason I still shop from time to time but the returns process is a big pain. Purchasing is also frustrating when limited to 60 minutes to browse for items in such a vast collection. As I'm searching & shopping through categories much of my cart gets released back, causing confusion in my order or me giving up and not purchasing anything in frustration. ASOS needs to change these 2 facets of its business design or customer loyalty will wane and they'll certainly lose business."

Instead of finding a solution themselves I recommended several possibilities and they were all denied. This is unacceptable and unprofessional.

On the new date i got in contact with asos and they are now telling me that I have to wait 24hrs for specialist team to make decision about replacing the item. The person I spoke to on the chat was so rude instead from trying to e plain to the customer about what happened to the first order or apologise, he sent a message for me to leave a feedback of I wasnt happy with the experience.

"October 04, 2019",1,That was the most useless customer‚Ä¶,That was the most useless customer service. I chatted earlier to say my parcel wasn't tracking but was due today. Mark said he couldn't tell me anything until the day had ended. So after the day ended I spoke with Sophie and her great advice was to wait another month. She refused to tell me what would happen at the end of the month or why Mark couldn't have just told me to wait a month when I chatted with him earlier. This was so frustrating.
"October 04, 2019",1,Ordered a few items for next day‚Ä¶,"Ordered a few items for next day delivery. Nothing arrived. No communication on a delay. Still nothing after 2 days and no communication from ASOS. Had to chase through their chat service which informed me that there was a weeks delay! On a next day delivery package!Got a completely scripted response - little more than an apology and that there was nothing they could do, I just had to wait. No offer of any compensation when I pay for a next day service! Very unhappy."

Person on the other end told me October 2nd arrival.  October 2nd, no delivery. Contacted ASOS and fedex‚Äîneither had responses regarding the package. I have 6 emails with ASOS customer service where their only response is ‚Äúthank you for your email.

Being a cheaper product ($11), I'd expect for them to either issue a refund and allow me to reorder or just send me the correct item. Instead they were refusing to do either and wanted me to return my purchase and order it again."

Asos gets 5 stars from me returns are a breeze and the bag my purchase came in looks like I walked out of the store. Thanks again Sabrina!"
"October 03, 2019",1,Terrible experience,"Terrible experience. My package was due on the 27th of September, when it didn't come I contacted ASOS as my tracking had not been updated since the 24th. My package had been scanned to be sent to my country but not shipped apparently. I was told the tracking would update AFTER the delivery when I said that isnt really helpful I was given a weird cold response and basically shrugged off and told to wait until the 3rd. I requested ASOS contact the courier about the tracking as I was not confident it would arrive and they told me no. On the 3rd by 7pm there was no delivery, I was then told to wait until midnight because apparently some customers get their deliveries after 5pm?? And this morning of course, no package. I contacted ASOS again today and was then told to wait until the 7th!? Then told i would be contacted by a specialist in up to 48 HOURS! I demanded a refund, noted the negative reviews I have been reading about people with the same experience and again I was ignored. They closed the chat on me and told me to contact them tomorrow morning if I still haven't got the package. Absolutely disgusting customer service. NEVER ordering from ASOS again! After over 6 years of loving asos and never having a problem, usually my orders come before estimated time, they let me down so drastically. Other sites would offer sympathy and solutions such as refunds or re-ordering, discount codes etc.But no, nothing. No compensation. GARBAGE behavior from an international retailer."

Have asked for an update and the delivery company (Hermes) website has not been updated since LAST thursday (a week ago today). Have spoken to customer care @ asos who advised me to wait a few more days to see if it shows up. Terrible service. And it seems like I am not the only customer in this situation.
"October 03, 2019",2,Still don't know where my parcel is! e,"Lost parcel  meant to be next day delivery but no one cares! Would be 1 star but ASOS used to be my favourite. It's gone dreadfully downhill in my eyes now- last dress I bought I had to return because it had a hole in but I thought that must have been a fluke then I buy premier next day delivery and order some shoes for work and a corporate event and they still aren't here 4 days later and despite tweeting & live chatting I pretty much got empty apologies and shrugs- when I asked one assistant whether I could assume it wouldn't arrive after 9pm he said it might still arrive after 9pm and I stayed up (I work early shifts)  the twitter team is dreadful they may as well delete it and the live chat are all terrible too when I said I was unhappy one assistant said ""please feel free to close the chat"" I was polite and didn't use any foul language either! I know ASOS are struggling but they need to invest in customer service training or they will get a lot worse. They have lost a long time customer. I would say AVOID and use boohoo or h&m or new look the list is endless-  before asos. not like we aren't spoiled for choice just go to a competitor."

When I set up my profile I used the address finder, and found my address.  However it used avenue instead of street, which I missed.  This address doesn‚Äôt actually exist, even though google maps shows it.  There is a number that is close, but not the address.  FedEx delivered it to this incorrect address.  This meant that unless the person who received package returned it to ASOS, I would be out the money and the clothes.  Not a great situation for me.  Moral of the story is pay attention when you are setting up your account!  Fortunately I went knocking on peoples doors on that block like a crazy person until I tracked down the package.I texted with Amy in customer support who was quick and responsive, but because it was my fault, there was nothing ASOS could do.  Thank you for the help Amy!  I would order from them again."

"October 03, 2019",1,I used ASOS for years,"I used ASOS for years, never had a problem until recently. This company is no longer what it used to be. The quality of the clothing is not the same, and when you return things they either take very long to process it or in the case of my last order, 'miss' it.I got in touch about the return they hadn't refunded me for and the first advisor, Janine, informed me that as they need 7 working days before they can do anything about it I need to wait until midnight (the chat was just before 10pm). She assured me that once this time had passed, I can let them know which items were returned and my refund will be processed. I waited and got back in touch the next day and Hannah asks me which items I returned. Upon realising that I returned most of the order (due to the aforementioned drop in quality) she then said it has been passed onto another department that take another 48 hours to respond. When I asked her to explain why and was clearly upset about further delay despite being given different information the previous day, she failed to do this and ended the chat rather rudely without notice or waiting for a response from me.I think this marks the end of my ASOS relationship. What a shame, used to be great but I can no longer trust the quality or returns process - I wonder how many people return things only to forget about it and never get a refund..."
"October 03, 2019",5,Thank you!,Emma was really helpful! I thought an item would fit fine but later realized a smaller size would probably fit better. This was after I threw out the return label and the tags. Emma was so kind to ensure I'm able to get the right size and return the item that was a bit too large. Thank you!

"October 03, 2019",2,ASOS does not own up to its mistakes!,"Given that this company receives MANY orders...you would think whenever the company (or the shipping company it decides to use) makes a mistake...that you, the CLIENT, whom has PAID in full for the service/items...does NOT receive the run around! I reported immediately when my package indicated that it was ""delivered"" had NOT been delivered...I was asked to follow a series of ""steps"" before I was deemed of telling the truth.  After having to go out FULLY OUT of my way...on a trip to my local post office...I had to report for a 3rd time to FINALLY be referred to a ""specialist team"" (this takes 24 hours...or so they say). However, AFTER over 36 hours (because I gave them more than enough time), I reached out again.  Only to be told that I had to wait another 12 hours...surprise, surprise.  Not only have I waited a week just to ""inquire"" about the whereabouts of my package or a resolution...I also asked about the items and if I had an opportunity to place them on my same items ""on hold.""  I was blatantly told ""NO"" and therefore I may not even receive my items and/or they may not even be available....because by the time this whole ""inquire"" finishes...who knows?  At this point, I am going to just request a refund from my banking institution.  I have all the chat transcripts and proof...I even went ahead and personally called FEDEX about the missing package. I think they got to me sooner than ASOS did!  At the end of the day, I know the mistake was the actual driver (that might have delivered it at the wrong address and said person did not have the decency to return it).  I know this because my building has anywhere from 10-20 packages delivered daily (and they are left out in the lobby and no one ever takes them!)  I have never had issues receiving a package until my order with ASOS.  The tedious part has been getting ASOS to assist in resolving my dispute in a reasonable and timely manner.  Beware! If your package ever goes missing....get ready to undergo a serious of obstacle courses/questions to get to a possible resolution!"

As I explained to Kathryn on chat that my TOTUM card is valid until 5/10/19 but when I'm putting the code in at checkout it's saying it's invalid, which I have found extremely frustrating as I needed to place an order today!!But Kathryn told me that I 'd have to contact TOTUM as only they could resolve the issue, (though when I used my card earlier today it worked) When I  asked Kathryn if there was a supervisor available she just closed the chat!!!Leaving me feeling incredibly dissatisfied with your customer service"

You're greeted by customer service advisors who tell you that there's nothing they can do, and that there is no compensation for the delivery charge you paid, even tho it was late and the delivery date was not met.I'm usually quite happy with ASOS, although, I've never had to contact support until now. I'll no longer be using ASOS and will be taking my business elsewhere, to companies who actually have a duty of care for their customers.Don't recommend."

I have no problem with returning the product, ASOS returns are hassle-free, however I am absolutely gutted that the item is now Sold out, and I am leaving in 2 days anyways, so will need to find a very last minute gift... Thanks for the added stress, ASOS...."
"October 02, 2019",1,ASOS inventory scam on consumer,I did not recieve a shirt out of my order that was $29. My discount code was $20 off of over $100 which is less than 20% off. I was only refunded 8.99 for a $29 top that never arrived. I could understand being refunded  $29 minus the 20% (even though discount was less than 20%) but this was not the case. I wanted the shirt and not the money but it is out of stock. I will not be shopping with ASOS again and will be contacting the BBB and attorneys generals office. If you cannot provide a service the customer should not be punished for it. Ryan was the name of the representative that provided unfair treatment. They need to fix their inventory issues as well as better train their staff.

I also paid for premium delivery, my items were never delivered on time according to premium subscription and then they were not willing to give me a refund for the premium service either that I only used one time to get that specific item delivered on time. They even argued i can use my premium to spend the gift card they sent me. Ironic that I now need to spend the full amount of money with them and have nothing back in my bank account. I was chatting to them over half an hour and they kept sending me automated messages with their policies about refund. They did not pass me to talk to anyone senior."

Asos team, please kindly promote young nadine and or increase her pay grade as us big footed women need to spend a lot more money on shoes than those frustrating women who fit into junior sizes."

Out of the 5 times I contacted ASOS over 1 single issue, only one person (Laura) was helpful and actually resolved my issue within 15 minutes.

"October 02, 2019",1,Late order,"I pay for next day delivery and get told twice (by Safina and Yusuf) that it was out for delivery, it could be delivered up to 12am that evening which is ridiculous itself and if no one was in they would Leave a calling card. No calling card was left so I am thinking I was lied to knowing full wellThe order would not be delivered, I doubt it was even out for delivery. I was then told by Stuart that I had to wait 48 hours and he could not tell me where my parcel was. I received no initial email saying it was out for delivery and could not advice the driver it was safe to leave the parcel so am completely unhappy with the the so called ‚Äònext day delivery‚Äô service and the automated responses I receive through the live chat. I understand there are processes to follow but when the process is flawed maybe it should be looked into. With other online sites now doing the same thing with a better service I‚Äôll definitely be thinking about not Shopping with ASOS again."
"October 02, 2019",1,Not happy with the failed next day‚Ä¶,"Not happy with the failed next day delivery service.  Goods were not delivered within the next day term and no update or explanation from ASOS or their delivery agent.  Called several times for an update only to be told to wait till 24hrs for an update.  I call the next day and still being told I need to wait 24hrs for the delivery tracking to be updated.  Not sure what further update is needed if that next day delivery schedule is now lapsed and goods not delivered. I appreciate that the unexpected can happen but surely if this is the exception as opposed to the business norm then the business should prioritise failures in its service delivery terms, especially when customers pay a premium for this next day delivery service.  There is usually an urgent reason if someone has requested for next day delivery!  ASOS you need to do better."

"October 02, 2019",2,Bad Customer Service,"I keyed in the wrong address for my address. It was the address for my old office, where there are new tenants now that I do not know of. Your site only says that I can only cancel as you are not able to change the address once the order is confirmed. You only give customers 60min to cancel, which I think is too short. Clearly, I wasnt able to cancel it. Second, I sought help from your customer service live chat. As expected, they only gave me the same answer whereby you guys cannot do anything about instances like this. My only concern is that someone else receives it for me then that person takes the parcel and goes jolly home with his/her new items. You didn't provide me with any solution. It's like you only care about being able to pack to parcel and have it shipped and fulfilled. Making sure it ends up to the right person is already off your hands. You can only hope that it does. It's disappointing as I am left with just hoping the person that receives it will have the kind heart to find me and pass the parcel to me (which I highly doubt).  I've been a customer for years, but this is the first time you guys gave me little to no help at all."

Contacted customer care again to say that I didn't wish to cancel the order but was told it was too late. However, as the item was still in stock, I could reorder it (though not at the original sale price).  If I contacted them again after receiving the item they would then refund me the difference. I appreciate the gesture but after waiting 3 weeks to receive my original order, I'm not feeling inclined to reorder it at an increased price after they cancelled the order in error - the whole experience has just been a lot of hassle."

Their contract is with Hermes who are a disgrace! Expecting my Premier delivery today but Hermes have texted to say they will not be coming.ASOS likes to absolve themselves of blame by saying yes we are happy to take your money for Premier delivery service but if our contractor doesn't deliver it has nothing to do with us.Absolutely fuming & let down by ASOS!!!!
"October 01, 2019",3,I really want to give Asos five stars‚Ä¶,"I really want to give Asos five stars as I have been shopping with them for years and have had very little need to complain about in that time. You order something, it arrives the next day, keep it or you send it back. No problem. However, recently the company has been using the courier Hermes and the last 3 orders I‚Äôve made have been delayed, one order took 5 days to arrive. The chat rep I spoke to was really nice and friendly as I told her that I was making a complaint about Hermes, she took the complaint, confirmed the delays and told me this would be investigated internally.    My advice would be that more people do this, complain to ASOS about Hermes (as Hermes has no customer service) and hopefully they might change courier. At the moment I‚Äôm thinking twice about ordering from ASOS until they get rid of Hermes."

I just want to send my dress back and receive a replacement but I have to refund it and repurchase. If the UK can have an exchange policy, why can‚Äôt Australia? When I mentioned that I need it replaced within 18 days due to a wedding, the online chat person said I can pay extra for express shipping! Why should I have to pay extra for an issue that isn‚Äôt my fault? Thankfully I was offered a refund on express shipping once my order has been dispatched. Again, why am I being made to pay in the first place? Maybe ASOS should be a little more on top of their quality control? And maybe there needs to be better processes in place to satisfy dissatisfied customers, on a case by case basis? I‚Äôm so frustrated by the clunkiness of the whole experience and most likely won‚Äôt shop with ASOS again. 3 strikes and you‚Äôre out!"

However, what seems to be a reoccurring factor that counteracts this companies service is the delivery. There have been many occasions where I have paid for next day delivery and it has not come next day, I tend to think often this is normal. On the other hand as it happened recently, it had led me to think...what service am I actually paying for if it doesn't arrive next day? After being in touch with their customer service team several times, it seems that they are too blas√© to actually want to help their customers. No sense of urgency, no sense of compassion and not a thought of compensation.The attitude many Asos workers seem to bring really make me want to reduce the business I conduct with them, which is an awful pity."

Contacted customer care expecting an apology and some sort of gesture of goodwill to make up for the poor service. Had a half hearted apology told I should wait up to 4 days for my package before contacting them again and they wouldn‚Äôt refund my delivery charge as it‚Äôs in their policy. The clues in the name ‚Äúnext day delivery‚Äù when I asked how do I complain she told me I can‚Äôt and she‚Äôs the only person I can speak to! Talk about complaint avoidance!

They gave me an estimated date of delivery. however, three days earlier I received an email from Yodel saying my delivery is due today. So I stayed in all day and night since Yodel delivers until 9pm. And they never turned up. On contacting asos, all they could tell me was my item was due on the 3rd. I did tell them but now it means me having to wait another 1 day stuck inside the house.Then afte the chat I received a confirmation saying my delivery has been made, while I received none at all.

I have really lost the trust in company, so I don‚Äôt even order clothing from them anymore.

I was a bit suspicious to start with but thought why not try it.Well first off when looking online and seeing woman with all types of normal bodies and no sign of photo shop made me feel so much happier buying from there. I then get my bralettes looking at them I thought 'oh nope they won't fit I'm just at square one'. I tried them on, BEST FIT EVER! Honestly I couldn't think of a better fitting bra. One from figleaves and the others from ASOS. Goodbye under wire hello sexy new bralettes. ASOS you have outdone yourself. Girls with big boobs and are curvy trust me you won't regret these at all."

I reached out with my order # and tracking # and was told they usually take 10 business days so to check back if I hadn‚Äôt gotten an email confirming my return in a couple days. I did just that and still no email so I followed up. Jodie looked at the file and could see I had already reached out once and sent my return for manual processing right away. Very shortly thereafter I received an email saying my return had been issued a refund. This was seamless compared to other online return issues I have had with other companies.

"September 30, 2019",1,Hands down the WORST company,"This is hands down the WORST company to use for online clothes shopping.Firstly they may have a large selection of choice but half of it is the worst quality you can possibly get and the other half doesn't come through looking anything like what they're marketing. With all of this in mind I thought I'd get an order of T-shirts done through this website for my upcoming holiday. The idea being it would be an easy purchase as everything is in one place. My god i couldn't have been any more wrong. They firstly take over the 5 working days they say they would to deliver (7 days taken) but on top of this they send my order to an address I lived in almost 7 years ago!!!! I had just updated my billing and delivery addresses and set as my default as I hadn't used the site in a while and it said it had been confirmed. Even on my checkout page it said my new delivery address. I then received an email saying they'd delivered my clothing to my address from 7 years ago this morning and chat to the customer services team (Taylor and then Thameena) who basically told me this is my problem. They wouldn't listen to the fact that I updated my details and it stated that on my order summary and kept putting the blame back on me. The end result was Taylor closed the chat down because he couldn't be bothered to sort it out himself and then Thameena kept on with the ""Your problem not ours"". They have literally robbed me of ¬£85 due to a system error there end and are flat out refusing to re-send my parcel or refund my money. There only advice has been to do the 80 mile round trip to my old address to pick up my parcel - they didn't offer to pay for the petrol funnily enough.Lesson learned - I will never ever use this site again. Absolutely shocking customer services and a company that can't hold their hand up when they've made a mistake. Even if i need a quick clothing solution it would be quicker for me to visit each individual brand's shop then order through this absolute joke of a website/company. You stole ¬£85 of my money and I'll do whatever I can to make this known to everyone."

I told them I needed the item by a certain date. They did not offer to send me the item overnight or 2nd day for free. Most other companies would have done so, as it was their error. I'll never order from crappy ASOS again. There are many other affordable websites (AMAZON etc) with MUCH better customer service."

"September 26, 2019",1,Absolutely awful,"Absolutely awful. I received my package only to open it and realize that nothing I ordered was in the package, they got the entire order wrong. I contacted customer service only to find out that to get what I ordered, I had to place another separate order and return the items I received. Not only did I have to double pay for an order that was wrong, but when the replacement order came that was wrong too. I was assured by the first customer service rep that the second order would be correct and I wouldn't have to worry about this happening again. I reached back out to customer support only to sit there for fifteen minutes waiting for a response that never came. An incredibly frustrating experience and I will never order from ASOS again."
"September 26, 2019",2,Garment videos on website - annoying,"I‚Äôm a long term ASOS customer but these newer ‚Äòartistic‚Äô versions of the videos they have showing the garment on a moving model is plain stupid. It use to be that the camera was static and you got to see the garment in full with the model walking towards and away from the camera, like a full view catwalk.But now they don‚Äôt keep the camera still or even show the whole garment in one shot. They‚Äôre trying to be edgy with camera play but it‚Äôs pointless and nauseating, and has put me off so bad that I now refuse to buy anything that doesn‚Äôt show a proper full view example, as I feel they‚Äôre trying to hide faults or less flattery features of the garment. Please bring back the standard full view static camera videos!"

This would be fine but my originally order had a discount which they now said was void because I was ‚Äúreturning‚Äù an item. Basically I only received back half of what the item was worth and then was expected to reorder it at full cost (since that discount was no longer available). All I wanted was for them to send me the item I originally ordered. Staff were VERY unhelpful and their replies were obviously scripted/auto generated. ASOS has lost a regular customer."
"September 26, 2019",3,Overall good but issues tend to be thrown around within the company.,"On the whole, I like Asos, but lately the same problems are emerging again and again.Asos has good prices, student discounts,  virtual catwalk to see how clothes fit, a wide product range and customer support are always nice to you. However, something that often happens is that the delivery is wrong and even if the staff are nice and wants to help, it feels like there is a lack of communication between customer service and other branches like purchasing, stock etc.The matter is often sent around between different people within the company and usually to the level that someone forgets to answer so you do not hear back from them and you'll have to contact them again.Most of the time I'm missing items or a package is missing which get really frustrating when it happens too often. Besides this issue i would recommend Asos."

Why would I reorder an item, when I have no faith in your ability to fill it correctly!!Rip off company!! 800 number..doesn‚Äôt exist and that‚Äôs because they only care about making money not their customers!!!"

I ordered some cute boots from them that I was really excited about. I tracked my package the whole time until it said it had been delivered. Got home, checked the porch, well my package definitely was not shoes. Sure enough, I received a cheap, crappy pair of sunglasses instead of the boots I ordered. I immediately emailed customer care. The response I received was that instead of fixing the mistake and sending me the correct item, I would have to just purchase the boots AGAIN and within 45 days of returning the sunglasses THEN my money would be refunded. That is insane!! Working in customer care myself, this would NEVER be an appropriate way to handle something that had been our mistake. I then used their chat to talk to someone, they gave me the same freaking response. So ridiculous that they refuse to fix their mistake!! It‚Äôs also really ridiculous they don‚Äôt have a number you can call to talk to a real person. I will never order from here again! Do not even waste your time. Because by taking the chance your item is incorrect, they will not help you by fixing it. You‚Äôre just screwed. If I could leave zero stars I absolutely would. Because it‚Äôs not bad it‚Äôs horrible."

I tried to find the parcel for a week and DHL told me that it was lost, and that they could do nothing about it. So did ASOS. They refunded me a week after. In the meantime I did my own research and found the person who signed for my parcel on facebook. She was eager to send it back to me but I told her to contact ASOS instead and send it back to them. When I contacted ASOS they told me that the items were sold right away without even caring of contacting me or just saying a simple ""Thanks for your honesty man"". This is the last time I am getting anything from ASOS, these guys are a real headache."

When addressed the issue to ASOS customer service (Chloe) was told that she cannot speak in the driver's name and a refund is out of question because the delivery has been 'attempted'. Never order from them again, for sure!"

How can you process part of it and not the rest. According to them they never received it and when I showed them proof they got back to me and said it wasn't in the bag.So what is it? you didn't get the parcel or it wasn't in the bag? I showed them photos of the bag as 2 of the items where bulky and the bag would be that big if those 2 items weren't in it.Then just basically shut my account and i never heard from them as any e-mail sent will be blocked as they have stated in their last e-mail.What they're doing is criminal it's basically stealing."

I didn‚Äôt make a copy of the prepaid parcel label but being that I do business with the company that I dropped the package off at.. the young man knew exactly the package that I dropped off and assured me it went out. The Manager is looking into this matter at the drop location but in the mean time I will never order from ASOS ever again! Their customer service SUCKS and how do you not have LIVE Representatives to speak with for concerns! Never Never Never in my LIFE will I deal with them and I will spread the word TO AVOID doing business with them by any means! I also requested a return label to return the other items! This time I‚Äôll make damn sure to get a copy of the return label. I‚Äôm returning those items because I don‚Äôt like their business tactics when dealing with customers! So I want all my money back!

The experience was terrible."
"September 25, 2019",1,Absolute Disgrace,"I agree with the numerous other posts citing the absolute lack of customer service exercised by this company.  I received an email stating that my return would be refunded to my account and then they proceeded to provide me with a credit instead.  When I inquired about it they simply stated that was an automated message and I should not have taken it seriously.  I replied that the message was an error on their part and they should honor was they said.  They flat out refused and eventually ended the conversation on me! (It was an online chat since they don't have a phone number listed... how convenient.)  This company lacks any and all sense of accountability and if it's going to survive (ie. not lose all of its customers) it really needs to revamp how it approaches customer service situations.  Oh, and stay true to what they say!  An absolute disgrace."
"September 24, 2019",1,Ghost delivery attempts and robotic customer service responses....,Ordered clothes - purchased the express delivery to receive my order as quickly as possible. Did not turn up on the sunday it was expected to be delivered. Then recieved a notification on monday stating they had delivered and then another update a minute later that they had attempted delivery but no one was home to sign for it - this is completely fake. I was at home all day and have cctv which shows me taking amazon packages and meetings all day at home. A complete bunch of liars as when I asked for help using the online chat the same standard generic answers are used to bat customers away. I am just constantly told that no one was home which is completely fake. Cannot deliver on time despite me paying extra matched with pathetic customer service online - I always wondered why the share price halved and now its clear!

I honestly feel like whoever you‚Äôre speaking to doesn‚Äôt care at all and is just writing whatever they‚Äôve been told to in training.

Another agent told me the parcel is just delayed for one day (it‚Äôs been a week), some other told me it wasn‚Äôt shipped yet and to top it off, 4 different agents give me 4 different dates until which I have to wait before they can do anything.This is the absolute worst. They only send out automatic replies and give me random dates to have me wait longer.Nobody is assisting me and I can‚Äôt even call them.Pathetic and appalling. Absolute worst customer service ever.

"September 23, 2019",1,Don't order anything next day,"First shopping experience with Asos has been truly awful. I ordered at 16:00 on Thursday for a Next Day Delivery (cut off of 23:00) for Friday, the next day I checked on the estimated delivery time as nothing had arrived by 17:00. Turned out that they have moved the estimated delivery to suit their own needs. No messaging to me or the site on Thursday about Next Day Delivery delays, but they had added one on Friday, way after I had made my order. I requested to cancel my order and was told it was too late to do so, and was recommended to refuse delivery, which was not an option considering I chose delivery to my work to ensure I could receive the parcel on Friday. Well, I'm not at work on Saturday am I. So after a deluge of emails and text messages about a delivery they could not make and I could not collect, they chose to deliver to a collection point. I have no use for the item after Saturday, which is the entire reason I opted for NEXT DAY delivery. Now I have to go collect the parcel in order to send it back. Imbeciles. Customer service was no help, they had no solution, poor shopping experience, wasted time, wasted money, laughable over-communication about an order which had passed its intended use pretty much 24hrs after ordering. TL; DR Asos may change their delivery estimates without warning and are useless at offering a workable solution."

I have had a refund, but after spending more than a month trying to get in touch with them per any email I could find, chat and on social media - without ever getting a proper response.

They basically shut you down instead of helping you out. I haven't received my order yet and they keep pushing the date back farther. I'm now afraid that they may never arrive. It's making me very nervous because there is basically no one that can help you.
"September 20, 2019",5,ASOS has always been great,ASOS has always been great. These people just complain cos they don't get their way. Personally always had a great experience with ASOS even with delivery. I think it's worth it and better quality and policy than boohoo

Bought my items for an upcoming trip that I‚Äôm leaving for tomorrow... super annoying and probably wouldn‚Äôt have ordered. Also mind you I ordered a week ago so their shipping takes about 2 weeks. I‚Äôm also scared it won‚Äôt even come or have the correct items because of all these other reviews. Save your time and money.
"September 20, 2019",1,Utterly shocking customer service.,"Utterly shocking customer service,I will never use ASOS again and if I was anyone thinking about it don‚Äôt order from them,ordered 275 pounds worth of clothes for my daughters birthday,ordered it through my partner as he had premium so we could get it the next day for free we‚Äôll 10 days later still waiting,won‚Äôt answer phone or respond to emails,totally stressed and disappointed as my daughter didn‚Äôt get her birthday present now,completely out of pocket so can‚Äôt afford to buy her anything else,7 working days for a refund,why?just kept cutting us off on live chats,awful site.do not use,overpriced and terrible service."
"September 20, 2019",1,Been at home all day today waiting for‚Ä¶,Been at home all day today waiting for an urgent ASOS parcel on next day delivery via Hermes. Have security cameras on the front and back doors. Get a message from Hermes to say that parcel has been delivered at 10:59 and that I signed for it. Well - that would have to be a miracle as there has been no delivery at my home and I haven't signed for a darn thing. Tried to find contact details for Hermes UK - good luck with that as their phone lines refer you back to web chat on their site.....only there is no web chat link. Tried web chat with ASOS - they basically accused me of being blind/forgetful/a thief and have told me they'll look into it and someone should be in contact with me in the next day or two. Not much use to me when I needed the items today. Honestly - what a total and utter shambles. Thanks for ruining my day.
"September 20, 2019",1,Terrible customer service,"Terrible customer service , parcel went missing no ownership and don‚Äôt offer anything for delivery being late and then not turning up.. absolutely terrible service received"
"September 20, 2019",1,"Missing items, literally no customer serviece","Placed an order including 3 items. Recieved no email either about any of them being out of stock or of them being removed. Not to tell I didn't get any information about my parcel being dispatched. Eventhough asos was one of my favourite online shops for a long time,lately their customer is terrible. Not sure I'll order again."
"September 20, 2019",1,I am leaving this review as yet again I‚Ä¶,I am leaving this review as yet again I have not received my order from Asos by the stated delivery date. I expected to receive it on the 18th September and when I contacted them this morning I was told there was a issue with their delivery service and my order had been delayed en route. I was told to give it until the 27th before contacting them again. This has happened on previous occasions with orders I have placed with Asos. After this I will be using alternative companies for online shopping. Appalling service.Update - Checked the tracking information today (21st)  it now informs me that my order is being returned to Asos. I contacted Asos and after a lengthy wait was given a  variety of reasons why it might not have been delivered. All of these excuses related to Hermes not being able to hand the order over to myself. Funny that when I know the delivery person personally and she always leaves it in a safe place we have arranged! Don't think it will be long before we see the demise of Asos.
"September 20, 2019",1,Refused a faulty product,"Refused a faulty product, still within the first 6 months of purchase, will be covered or refunded. Web-chat is very rude and shut all conversations down before anything resolved. No phone number to contact. Basically they take your money and want nothing to do with you after. Customer service + aftercare is non existent now."
"September 20, 2019",1,appalling service. 0 stars!,"Absolutely appalled by the level of ignorance the costumer service team provide, first time shopping with ASOS and it will certainly be my last too, received my order which was fine other than I needed to return two items for bigger sizes, sent them back a week and half ago and heard nothing. Contacted the Asos online chat only to be spoken to by two rude employees,basically telling me the same thing (that I provided my information wrong and they had no order) which I clearly did as I returned it. Wouldn‚Äôt give me a number as they said they don‚Äôt have one. It‚Äôs an online base, They couldn‚Äôt care less and closed the chats. Rude is an understatement, no apology and no resolution, basically going to take my money and scam me. Ignorant and have 0 costumer service skills!"
"September 20, 2019",1,LITERAL WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I‚ÄôVE EVER EXPERIENCED !!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the LITERAL worst company to buy from. So unreliable, rude, and self serving. I mean it when I say you‚Äôd be better off stuffing your money down a garage disposal and turning it on. I gave them 1 star because negative infinity stars isn‚Äôt an option. Please read my ASOS horror story below and I thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. I ordered a pair of pants from ASOS and paid extra for expedited shipping so they would arrive on time for me to wear them to an event. My package arrived, and inside it was a dress I had not ordered and no pants. I contacted ASOS to correct the issue and they essentially said it was my responsibility to correct their mistake by sending the item back, waiting 10 days for a refund, and then re ordering the pants IF they still happen to have them in my size. This is an item I already paid for and now I have to go order it again but only if it‚Äôs still available at which point it certainly won‚Äôt be on time for my event. So I sent the dress back, waited 10 days for my refund, and did not order a new pair of pants because by this time it didn‚Äôt matter. It was too late. I had already asked why they weren‚Äôt falling all over themselves to apologetically overnight me my real order, but of course, they sent an automated message about what I need to do to fix THEIR MISTAKE. I finally received my refund but it was missing 9 dollars which turned out to be the extra shipping charge! They did NOT refund me for the shipping even though this was a service I paid for that I did not receive! After contacting them about it AGAIN, they told me they were not going to refund the shipping, sent me some automated messages, told me there was no one higher up I could talk to, and ended the chat before I could say anything. Think about this: if I had reordered those pants like they told me was my only option if I still wanted them, I would have to pay ANOTHER shipping charge to get them to me, and the last one wasn‚Äôt even refunded! That means I basically paid this company to send me something I didn‚Äôt want, and then for me to send it back. That‚Äôs what I paid for. And they think it‚Äôs legal to just not give me my money back due to their falter. Its not about the $9 dollars, it‚Äôs a matter of principal and compensation for the incredibly demeaning and infuriating service I received at this point."
"September 20, 2019",1,Item Never Arrived,"I placed my order at the beginning of the month, after two weeks my order still hadn't arrived so I contacted their customer service line. The rep I spoke to assured me that the shoes would arrive by the end of the next day, two more days went by and I never received my package. I contacted customer service again and received an email saying they'd refunded my money, I never got an explanation as to what happened to my order."

"September 19, 2019",1,Run from ASOS,"Bought a pair of ballet flats, wide. They DID come wide in the ball of the foot but the shoes ran BIG. Not even a discernable size.  I cant explain. The shoes were thrown together with no regard to feet... ANYONES feet. I took video. I walk out of shoes at each step. The toe portion doesnt cactually cover toes; not enough toe coverage regardless the size. Not real suede. Plastic. They actually curve BACKWARDS in the toe area on one shoe. Someone took a generic sole and put a larger piece of fabric over it to give the WIDE size. I am flabbergasted at the gall some sellers have. I wear an 8/8.5 US. Ordered 6UK.

So even tho they wore the ones that send wrong item and then wrong amount I was the one to go and sort it with my bank in my free time which I do not have - hence shopping online. I had a terrible experience also because a new person was answering my emails each time and they did not bother to read the whole thread so I had to explain what my problem was over and over again.To be fair they were always polite and told me my feedback is valuable and they will use it to improve. Frankly I would prefer them less polite and solve the problem for me, not for someone in the future."

After a few weeks I noticed I never received a refund and decided to check online to see where the package might be. The site's return information was to create a new label instead of using the one they had in the box! So I was unable to track the progress but since Asos created the label they should be able to. They asked me to wait longer as their returns center was backed up. In the end I still haven't received a refund (a little over $100 worth) for the items and when I inquire about it they refuse to give an answer outside of their customer service book. It was my first time ordering from them and I will never order from them again.
"September 18, 2019",1,Used to be such a great company,"Used to be such a great company. I'm appalled and saddened by their behaviour. Their parcel delivery partner Hermes are horrendous.

"September 18, 2019",1,Thieves  with terrible customer service,I have ordered from ASOS on a regular basis for some time and have never had a issue. Yesterday I received two orders that were made on the same day. The packages were both in a Hermes bag. One was in a unopened Asos bag the other was in a opened Asos bag with two items missing and no invoice. I contacted ASOS immediately via email to question if these two items were delayed or missing. Less than 24 hours later I receive a email to advise they will not issue a refund and will not accept any further orders from me. They have advised any further emails will be deleted with no response. As if I would ever want to reorder from such a cow boy company again. They still have not even answers the question are the items delayed or missing. All ok until there is a issue and you need help.
"September 18, 2019",1,Too many issues,"Too many issues, I used to order pretty much every month from them but there was always an issue with the orders so I have stopped for about half a year. Last week I decided to place another order, sizing completely off so sent back a few things and reordered in different sizes. When I open the parcel today, a pair of jeans in a bag labelled as a uk26, inside we have a pair of uk20 jeans, called customer service to complain and they refused to take my order number, log a complaint or do anything. Their solution is to send the items back and wait 2 weeks for a replacement or send the item back and wait 2 weeks for a refund and place the order again. Just awful customer service, I wouldn't recommend in a million years, I suppose their awful service and products are never going to change. Never ordering again."

"September 17, 2019",5,Great service!,"I have to say I was extremely impressed with the returns service (despite seeing the negative reviews on here). I returned part of my order and had one item I needed exchanged for a different size (which, ultimately, I ended up having to then return as it didn't fit). The whole process was fast and smooth with no need for me to chase or contact the team (this is rarely the case when you shop fashion online these days). I would definitely shop with ASOS again now I know I can shop with confidence. Thank you :)"
"September 17, 2019",4,Thanks ASOS for quick customer care - stolen watch replaced,"I had a devastating incident this past weekend where an MK designer watch I had ordered on ASOS was stolen from the package and I received an empty parcel. However, ASOS has really impressed me by how it responded to my issue. My parcel arrived empty on Sunday and by Tuesday they had already replaced my lost item with another one. My husband's birthday surprise was ruined, however I was not expecting them to act so quickly and sort my issue out within 48 hours. I had lost all faith in online shopping and was utterly devastated but I must say their customer care towards my issue has been very reassuring. My husband now has his watch and I am sooo relieved...On the other hand a token of apology for the inconvenience would have sorted this for good...anyhow I'm just glad I did not lose my money forever.  Thanks ASOS"
"September 17, 2019",1,If I could choose negative stars,"If I could choose negative stars, I would. Their customer service is obviously trained as ""company first, customer second."" I ordered 5 men's suits for my wedding with 2 day express shipping a month ago and still have not received my order.  When I talked to customer service, they explained that it's not in their control. The shipment originated in Atlanta, GA. I've had packages shipped the same day from New York so I'm not sure what's morning their control. It seems as if their charging for the express shipping but sending orders out as standard shipping and pocketing the remainder of the shipping fees paid. They didn't even offer to re return my shipping charge or give a discount on the items I purchased. I will NEVER order from this business again. ASOS, you suck."

Used a ¬£10 off code when you spend ¬£100 so essentially 10% off, i returned two items in total worth ¬£37. Instead of calculating 10% off that total they took their ¬£10 back because i now fall below the promotion threshold. Complete scam, i spoke to someone for 20 mins who could have easily credited ¬£5 back instead they kept refusing. They must pay the poor buggers peanuts to allow them to spend 20 minutes arguing about ¬£5 credit. Profit before service with ASOS."

I placed an order, and the sizing was completely off, seriously it was comical at how bad it was. Placed a second order and expedited the shipping as I was going on a trip and needed the clothes before I left the country. The package was lost, and even though FedEx determined it was lost ASOS wouldn't place a re-order or give me the same rate to place a new order until after I had left the country, which defeats the whole purpose. I sent several requests to help me with the issue, but each time they provided no assistance whatsoever. They also just end the chats on you, basically the equilivent of hanging up on someone. BEWARE if you order something from there, the clothes might be okay, but the stress, frustration, and crap customer service is not worth it."

Today (Monday) i contacted ASOS because there was no update 'in the morning' and they said I have to wait until the 19th! Which is THURSDAY for my parcel... I specifically purchased Premier delivery so I could get it before my holiday tomorrow (Tuesday). The customer service said they COULD NOT offer me a refund even though I not going to receive the stuff until after I come back from holiday and by then I won't need it. Especially as I now have to go out later this evening to buy all the stuff I need instead.

Ordered some stuff this weekend and this is my second order with Asos now which has been sent to a completely random address outside of London, the Customer Service agent contacted DPD via phone and was told they cannot rearrange a delivery to my home address. This meant I had to have this order cancelled ASWELL and was told by the Asos agent to reorder everything.I dont expect sloppy and unreliable delivery when I'm paying for next day premier delivery.

I recently bought a dress for an important party I was throwing and it ripped half way through the evening.I emailed ASOS and they said I could send it back for a refund or exchange it for another one - so I sent it back and asked for another one (I even made a note on the slip to Explain who told me it was ok to do this) and apparently there was a ‚Äòglitch‚Äô in the warehouse system and they refunded me due to insufficient stock of the dress. I checked the website and this is still fully in stock.. I emailed and apparently there‚Äôs nothing they can do about it. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever had a problem with ASOS and I‚Äôm really upset about it as I would have loved to keep the dress for memories. I think from now on I‚Äôll shop elsewhere.

Contarily, the tracking says I signed for it, while I was provably at work during the time of the delivery. Ive never received the parcel, assuming it got stolen since it was just left outside my door, yet they refused to refund any money. Only thing Asos suggested was to go with a click and collect order next time, what a joke!"

Hermes sent it back to ASOS and didn't even notify me. I had to contact ASOS myself to find out what was going on and they didn't know why it was sent back either even though Hermes told me to contact ASOS to find out why. I had to reorder the item again, get next day delivery and hope it arrives by tomorrow before I leave the house. This has been the biggest waste of time for one item. The online chat person was rude and obviously didn't care either. I will never order from here ever again. Worst delivery service and customer service."
"September 13, 2019",4,Top choice,"ASOS is my go to for the majority of my clothes, the variety of brands is great, and always has something I like. ASOS own brand clothes however are a bit more hit and miss. The quality is poor, but you get what you‚Äôre paying for I guess (e.g. my ‚Äònon-iron‚Äô blouse creases so easily and needs ironing after about 5 minutes of wearing it!)The next day delivery is amazing and I‚Äôve never had a problem with it, however their customer service isn‚Äôt the best, as I‚Äôve had conflicting statements given to me from different members of staff."
"September 13, 2019",1,Very poor quality products and their‚Ä¶,Very poor quality products and their customer service is pathetic. Their site is buggy and full of technical glitches. There are much better services and recommend you don't waste your time or money here.
"September 13, 2019",1,The worst online shop!,I hate asos! Thought it was decent but it is the worst! I pay for next day delivery and never get it!! Their customer service is outrageous!! Only live chat and all they say is wait until the time limit is up and then we can contact the local post. How shocking. Save yourself the hassle and do not order from here
"September 13, 2019",1,Poor customer service,"I am disappointed by this company.. I was in love in ASOS. And I didn‚Äôt have any issues with the delivery no matter in which country I lived. Last 2times I am waiting for my parcel especially long. Second time is special - courier missed my parcel. ASOS just wrote emails that I should wait.. First time  I waited for information about the parcel 2days, and now I received an email that I should wait 2 days more... ASOS you don‚Äôt respect your customers and it‚Äôs very very sad."

"September 12, 2019",1,Poor ASOS once highly rated,"Poor ASOS once highly rated, recommended to my friends and family as 5star service and now I'm not quite sure.I've had some of the best shopping experiences with ASOS over the span of 15 years and thousands of pounds spent too. Unfortunately, I don't think I have many positive things to say about this company anymore (very Sad)My recent experience is one I will never forget.I purchased 4 items on September 10th a leaving present for a lifelong friend going off to uni on the 14th, using a promo code my items qualified for 20% off. (yessss:)I proceeded with payment, already have the premier service so I arranged to work from home to be avail for next day delivery.September 11th, received my package, which was slightly open only to find that 1 of 4 items were packaged however the delivery note stated that the 4 items were enclosed. Immediately I contacted ASOS and asked for them to find my items or at least let me know when I will be expecting them to arrive (thinking that I might receive an additional delivery to complete the purchase) Instead I was refunded minus the discount for the 3 missing items which have been shown as in-stock up to the point of sale and some 24 hours later. I just want my purchases, Was happy to pay back the refund, in exchange for my items as I did not once ask for a refund.I have requested a formal complaint and I have been ignored.I have asked asos CC to put right their error as I should not forefiet ASOS mistake, I would like to be in the same place that I was in at the point of sale, nothing more or less I just want my goods. I was then offered a discount code providing I spend more than I did on the 10th of September, I just want to be in the same position that I was in on the 10th when I made the purchase. asos CC emailed me to say that if I place an order for the missing three items ASOS will refund me the difference so that I am no better or no worse off from my original purchase made on September 10th. Once completed I was asked to provide the order number so that they can refund me the difference. (hallelujah!!! Not....)asos cc proceeded with further fooleryThey stated that they can only apply a discount on items over the value of ¬£125 and as my order does not amount to this I do not qualify for a difference in amount refund. What a joke and a complete waste of my time, my consumer rights taken from me breaching the 'consumers right act 2015' I think it's time for asos to face legislative rules as they seem to have none in place. They will be reported!!"
"September 12, 2019",1,ASOS have forgotten about their customers,"Really terrible experience resulting in a next day delivery purchase taking over a week to arrive. No communication; no accountability; customer service are useless simply blaming their delivery partners; pre-canned auto responses are not helpful and it really feels like ASOS no longer care about their customers. I wouldn‚Äôt mind if customer service simply admitted ‚Äúyeah, this sucks, sorry‚Äù - but the complete lack of empathy, coupled with pre-canned responses has led me here - my first ever review :-)It would seem that their plummeting share price this year correlates with the customer service they‚Äôre providing! Hopefully they sort it out soon."
"September 12, 2019",4,Reliable Company.,"My go to for fashion. Have been using their services for several years  and cant complain about my experiences. During holidays delivery maybe take longer but to be expected and they provide reliable track and trace information. Although most products on the site are good value, I find that the price of runners are slightly inflated compared to going directly to the brands website e.g Nike."

When I asked if I can keep the wrong dress and get back the difference in cost because I don't have the time to send back and wait for the right one in time for the wedding I got a very rude no. Not even owning up to their mistake!! So now no dress for the wedding. ASOS don't seem to know what customer service is, good luck to them in keeping customers I am surely never ordering from them again."
"September 12, 2019",4,Next Day Delivery is Great!,"I've been a premium member for a few years now and next day delivery is great. If an item isn't right returns are really straightforward as well, unlike other online clothes stores"
"September 12, 2019",1,Issue voucher codes without telling you the expiry date,I was a member of their A List scheme which came to an end last year when they emailed me a voucher code to compensate. The email made no mention of any expiry date so I naturally thought there wasn't one. Tried to use the code yesterday only to find it had expired. Have been in contact with customer services but they refuse to replace it. Absolutely unacceptable.

Got copy/pasted some generic paragraphs, because I was unhappy I asked to escalate the complaint to someone higher and got copy/pasted another paragraph how I couldn't. She told me she wasn't doing anything else to help and closed the chat! All I wanted as a new prepaid label as the one they sent me had been printed incorrectly and had lines through it (nobody would be able to make sense of where I was sending it to!) Avoid avoid avoid."

"September 11, 2019",1,ASOS YOU ARE COMPLETE TRASH,"Asos Premier Delivery is a complete waste of time. It would be quicker and safer to have you parcel shipped via horse and cart! Customer Service is non existent, well thats a lie. Theres someone to talk too, but there's zero service. If you've got a complaint, they literally don't care at all and will close your ticket on you. If you're shopping on Asos, have fun getting your order on time and in a brand new condition."
"September 11, 2019",1,Clothes smell like FISH,"I frequently use ASOS, but this time round I have been very disappointed. I received items of clothing which smelt like FISH! Yes that is correct ... FISH! When I asked if the smell would not come out in the wash (even though I should not have to put the item in the wash) would I get a refund? I got a generic answer of ... we shall inspect the item. ASOS this was your mistake. Your clothes should not smell like fish in the first place. Spoke to a colleague at work and they mentioned they had a similar experience. standards are clearly slipping!"
"September 11, 2019",1,Do ASOS know the meaning of customer service?,"Asos is my go to for all orders and I‚Äôve spent ¬£1000s with them. However, I feel disappointed and let down by their customer service and it makes me not want to purchase again. I messaged in with a faulty item and I was inconveniently asked to return the item for a refund. It has been a while since I had received my refund, so I spoke to someone who asked for my details. I provided these and he said they were incorrect and closed that chat. Prior before asking me to try again or double check them. When I did check they were correct yet they still closed the chat? I then spoke to someone else who told me to wait until the next day. Shock, the next day came and they again told me to wait until the next day and that to reference the chat number and they‚Äôll get it resolved right away ( I sent confirmation of proof of postage). So again I came back, this time in total over three hours trying to get my refund for a fault on Asos part. They told me to resend more proof of postage despite sending it and it being confirmed at fine. I can‚Äôt believe the lack of customer support despite clearly being a continuous customer. I‚Äôm most disappointed at the inconvenience caused to return a faulty item and the fact my chat was closed for no reason and the general rude and blunt tone of employees. No wonder you‚Äôre having to lay off staff when your attitude is awful. A step up like other online brands needs to happen whereby you actually care for your customers especially ones with the amount of orders I have."

"September 11, 2019",1,Asos are shocking,Asos are shocking. My delivery never turn up and when I phones them up they have no contact with the couriers that collect the parcels. It took me 3 weeks to get a refund as every time I rang up there was an excuse or technical issue!
"September 11, 2019",1,DO NOT TRUST!!,"Not surprised at all to see that ASOS have a 2 star trust pilot rating. Or that they don't reply to any of the bad reviews on here. I had a package delivered with three items missing worth around ¬£170. ASOS are accepting no responsibility and will not refund or replace the items. They have basically stolen my money and banned me from the site so now I can't even talk to them. Paid for next day delivery and the items that did manage to  arrive didn't so until a full 2 working days later,. Didn't even arrive in a normal asos bag it was a damaged Hermes bag."
"September 11, 2019",5,"First time customer, will certainly be back","Just wanted to write how super impressed I am with ASOS. A friend suggested ASOS for maternity clothes. I‚Äôm just 20 weeks and all of a sudden nothing fits me!! I also have no clue what size I am, hence online shopping hasn‚Äôt been my friend! I ordered a skirt and two dresses, turns out I‚Äôm a 10 not 12 and two of the items just didn‚Äôt fit well. Arranging returns was SO easy, and I only dropped to the post office today and I‚Äôve already gotten a refund! I did order a few more items today, hopefully in the right size!! Thank you so much ASOS. I‚Äôm a crazy hormonal, feeling very fat, mess right now and you‚Äôve made my day!"
"September 10, 2019",3,Ordered a few items for my holiday on‚Ä¶,"Ordered a few items for my holiday on Monday, chose next day delivery. By 11pm the next morning I had not received my 1hour time-slot from the courier, so I checked DPD‚Äôs tracking which stated they had not received the parcel yet from ASOS. I then contacted DPD and they confirmed that even if the parcel was delivered into their network today, it would be impossible to deliver to me today. I contacted Asos via live chat, the representative fobbed me off and told me I needed to ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù if it delivered, even though I assured her three times that DPD hadn‚Äôt even received the parcel and so it was impossible for it to be delivered. I asked her to contact the Asos warehouse to see if there was any update and to avoid any further delays. She refused and said I had to wait until the end of the day. It is now 11:30 at night and the tracking says the DPD have still not received the parcel. Feeling really dissatisfied with the customer service and disappointed that my order has not delivered, with no clue as to when it might."
"September 10, 2019",1,Appalling,"Avoid this company if you actually want something on time. I paid for next day delivery between 6pm and 10pm, it has now been 5 days and still no order. Have tried to speak to customer service but they haven‚Äôt been helpful at all just keep telling me to wait a few more days and see if it turns up. Extremely disappointed with the experience with them as they haven‚Äôt kept up to their end of the deal and have been very unprofessional in the response to the issue Will never use Asos again."
"September 10, 2019",1,Keep sending me the wrong items,"I ordered a two piece set which included, a crop top and skirt. However when I recieved my package it included two tops to the set instead of the skirt. I contacted customer service and was told to resend one of the tops and then order a new skirt since it was still in stock. I did that and had to pay for shipping again. I received my new package and guess what? It was the top to the set again, which I did not order. So that makes it twice I received the wrong item and now the skirt is completely out of stock. Just horrible shipping and customer service! I don‚Äôt think I will be ordering from them again"
"September 10, 2019",1,Absolutely horrendous customer service,"Absolutely horrendous customer service. I deal with complaints in my own job on a daily basis and I would be fired if I handle them as poorly as this. All automated responses with absolutely no attempt to resolve any issues. I had a blazer on notification to alert me as soon as it was back in stock. I ordered the blazer next day delivery which didn‚Äôt arrive. I checked tracking and it advised there was a delay and to expect it 24/48 hours later. I patiently waited for 8 days to out of the blue receive a refund having never received or returned the item, which was now out of stock. I then complained to be told I could use the notification button. I replied to say I already had which is why I ordered it in the first place and why was I refunded without even receiving the item. I was told it had been lost. As I had no update for 8 days I missed out on any opportunity to purchase another as they were now completely sold out. I complained and was told it would be looked into. A few weeks later I returned the same item that I had ordered in a different colour as I didn‚Äôt like it. I was not refunded and told that I had already received my refund when I complained before. So even though they were two completely different blazers I have only received one refund and no one is taking my complaint seriously. TERRIBLE SERVICE. COMPLETE INCOMPETENCE"

The customer service department especially. I ordered the same dress twice and both times they sent the incorrect size, I needed this dress for an awards event. They said they couldn't send out another dress until they had investigated the situation, they were unhelpful and ended up hanging up on me! Hence to say I will never shop with them again."

I have never had this issue with these shoes before as I have brought two pairs of them previously. The customer care team were several different people, who with each reply didn't seem to have looked into the previous conversation. With one reply back stating to return the shoes in their original condition in the box!! Are you serious!! After a week of trying to sort it I was made aware that, even though they have supplied a faulty item, that they would refund me through a gift receipt!! As If after all that I would ever want to shop with them again!!"
"September 09, 2019",1,Very poor service,"Very poor service. When item is faulty the customer has to pay for the return. If a refund is made the discount of the total order is subtracted, so you end up spending more on the return than keeping a faulty item. Takes ages to get a reply as well. Very dissapointing!!"

They then told me to knock on neighbours doors etc despite telling me I had signed for it.The next day I rang again and they advised they dpd confirmed that I had signed for it and they delivered to my address. If I was disputed I needed to provide all sorts of evidence proving that I had not signed for the package.The next day a kind man who lived some 6 streets away arrived with the parcel advising he had found this outside his door by almost falling over it.I advised asos and no apology or anything remotely resembling this, despite me being a loyal and longstanding customer.Awful."

Followed up and was told they were delivered and to search around the house and go to the post office. I did and no sign of them. Then today I get an email saying that something went wrong with the order ( they never shipped ) and got a refund. What??? Needless to say I had to find another pair of shoes to wear for party.

This was the first time ordering from this company, and it seemed like a place I could trust. Apparently not.I ordered a jacket, and when I received it and tried it on, it was HUGE, running at least two sizes too big. All I wanted was an exchange. First of all, they told me that they couldn't exchange it and that I would have to return and then rebuy. Second, they told me that they would deduct the full $20 from the refund because I used a $20 off $100 order code. So they're going to refund me $31 and then want me to rebuy it at $51 instead of working to do an exchange for me. What?! This is horrible customer service! Not only that, but if the $20 item in my shipment hadn't worked out, they would have just kept it without refunding anything?? They need to do a prorated discount on each item like every other retailer when you use a coupon. It's ridiculous and unethical.Third, it's been a month and I still haven't received my refund. I used the sticker in the bag, filled out the form, and sent it back in the original bag. They told me 10 working days to receive confirmation that they received it, and I haven't received any confirmation at all. They've kept my item but haven't given me any credit back for it! First and last time I ever buy from this company. I'll stick with places I can trust, and I can't trust ASOS."

I asked ASOS to send a replacement order to me, and the response I got was that they needed to wait 2 weeks for the courier to confirm the delivery was lost, even though I had it in writing that the courier had admitted they had lost the parcel. I waited 2 weeks and ASOS agreed the parcel was lost, but then informed me my item was out of stock! So issued a refund with no apology. Absolutely shocking customer service. I think the company have some really great products/marketing but won't be shopping here because of a rubbish customer service, who didn't seek to make their wrong right."

After contacting asos on the very same day it said delivered, they said they are looking into it and will get back to me as soon as they have an answer from the courier. Till today it‚Äôs the same answer from every customer service agent. Like an automated message. Also you gotta chase them for answers. Finally I gave a call to their online number. The customer agent who spoke to me was rude. I told her if they aren‚Äôt able to find the order please issue a refund. She refused, saying till they have an answer from the courier they wouldn‚Äôt be able to do anything. First of all i only chose the clothing company not the courier. It‚Äôs not my bloody problem that asos has to wait for answers from the courier. It also shouldn‚Äôt take long to tell me who signed for the order if it was delivered to the reception.

When I finally got my money back from paypal the agent on the phone said that this company has more red flags and disputes then any other company he seen since working for paypal.

If and when my order arrives I'll be closing my account. I spent a fortune with them last year, and never had a problem, but this year it's total shambles. Shame"
"September 06, 2019",2,Return/refunds,Return and refunds are a shambles - They do not acknowledge receipt of the returned items and take a long time processing the refund. Far longer than any other clothing company I deal with. You always have to chase them for answers too. Poor service ASOS.

"September 05, 2019",1,ASOS sent me used shoes. Also terrible quality.,I had to return a pair of shies I ordered from ASOS because they had dirt and scruffs all over them and the sole of the shoes were dirty. Obviously someone had worn them already. Gross. Not the mention the quality of the shoes were bad.
"September 05, 2019",1,Honestly it‚Äôs hit or miss.,"Honestly it‚Äôs hit or miss... I pay for the yearly next day delivery subscription, and no matter what time of day it is, if I order early in the morning or late afternoon, I never really know if the item will arrive the next day... for example I bought an item yesterday, hoping it‚Äôll come today.. at 10am it says it‚Äôs with my local carrier, so obviously I‚Äôll just wait at home expecting that it‚Äôll arrive in an hour or two, at 3:30pm was when they sent a message saying it‚Äôll be delivered from 4-6pm, out of no where it‚Äôs updated as ‚Äúdelivery delay‚Äù... this is the 3rd time it has happened IN A MONTH... and I‚Äôve complained to asos customer service, stressing that i do pay for the yearly subscription so I should receive my parcel the next day (of course minus public holidays) and all they said was ‚Äúwait till the delivery arrives, then you can send it back if you don‚Äôt like it‚Äù and once I send it make it takes up to 2 weeks to return me my money?!?! Not even an apology..."
"September 05, 2019",1,Appalling service,Absolutely rubbish place to order from!!I bought 2 pairs of shoes One was completely the wrong item The other was meant to be a size 3 It even said a 3 in the actual shoe But they were massive My friend who is a 6 tried them on and they fit her!! Next I wanted to return What an absolute farce!! Managed to do it through a local Hermes store. I hadn‚Äôt heard anything about the return after 10 days so I emailed them. Only to be told they haven‚Äôt any responsibility for the item and basically if it‚Äôs lost it‚Äôs my fault 40 pounds down now!! This was my first and last order from here!! Never again
"September 05, 2019",5,Better and Cost-effective Service,"Sometimes, I can miss the delivery, it will be great if ASOS can leave a card and delivery my order to any place nearby so that I can collect it myself.

It either doesn‚Äôt look as pictured or the fabric is as cheap as it can be! I‚Äôm fed up with emails about their returns policy, it‚Äôs something they have to provide and shouldn‚Äôt be sent emails implying that I am ‚Äòabusing‚Äô their returns policy when it is my right as a consumer to return goods (in the same condition that I‚Äôve received) should I feel I have been mislead, the sizes/ proportions are off, or refuse to keep something where the quality is rubbish. Plenty of other shops I can pay a fraction of the price to get that if I so choose. There‚Äôs also plenty of shops where I can get decent quality clothes and not have to waste my time returning them. Given up on this company sorry but no thanks."

At first they ignored me so raised a complaint through resolver and they got back to me however they are taking long time to sort it out. I have requested a refund but they keep ignoring my request. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!!"
"September 05, 2019",1,Returns/Refunds are a shambles,"Over the past couple of years I had numerous friends tell me of their diabolical customer service with ASOS. As I hadn‚Äôt experienced it I assumed that they were exaggerating.I had bought a massive order with Klarna, all of the order was returned as it was unsuitable and I thought nothing of it until Klarna began chasing me for the payment.I was away at the time so spent the full weekend worrying about having to pay for a ¬£100+ order I hadn‚Äôt kept as I wasn‚Äôt sure I still had the receipt at home.I emailed ASOS chasing up the return to receive a response telling me they‚Äôd tried to refund me in July but it failed due to a technical glitch. Nobody bothered checking the refunds had gone through nor was any goodwill given for the stressful situation. Legally ASOS were required to refund the order within 14 days of receiving the refund back - when I stated this I was simply told again that it was a technical glitch. Maybe they need something in place to flag such issues.After this I sat with bated breath as I had returned some further orders. One of them I posted back before the 28 day deadline. However I have just received an email stating they were refunding my money onto gift card. As a company they need to take into consideration the delivery times back to themselves and also their own return processing time - which lately seems a hell of a lot longer than usual.I am currently awaiting a response to my email about this however I‚Äôm not hopeful."
"September 05, 2019",1,Threatened to deactivate my account,"After using Asos for many years (and spending a considerable amount with them along the way), I received an email from them yesterday threatening to deactivate my account because I was making too many returns. I had heard they were experiencing problems with young girls in particular, wearing their clothes for Instagram shots and then returning them.I am a 63 years young lady who has only returned things if they don't fit or don't look like the picture. In April this year, I also paid for a year's free delivery. I suspect this is what they don't like - that I am returning items but haven't paid the delivery charge in the first place - perhaps not viable for them?Anyway, I shall not shop with them any more. Told Daniel on the Chat service but he wasn't bothered. I can't purchase online if I don't have the facility to return unsuitable items (who does?) and Asos have totally disregarded my many years of loyalty to them in the past. I'm also very angry I have been forced to waste the year's free delivery I paid for and I am very suspicious of Asos's motives in regard to this and deactivating my account."
"September 05, 2019",4,Enhance Sizing Amongst Clothing Items,"I've been quite lucky in the products i bought. I've enjoyed almost everything i bought. I think the selection is nice to offer variety and cater many styles. Allowed to find something unique. I think the problem lied where some products were actually cheap quality and it wasn't really apparent then possibly price. I think one enhancement that would help is working with the clothing companies in showing the size as true as possible. For many items i had to do my own research which is annoying especially it takes my eyes off their site. Hope they keep improving and deliver great style. Also, PLEASE BRING BACK THE ADIDAS RETRO SWEATSHIRT I KEEP SEEING ON INSTAGRAM! It looks cool and everyone references ASOS but it's out or no longer available. Invest in style that people want."
"September 04, 2019",1,When you make more of an effort to resolve faulty goods than the company....,"Received faulty Jeans, contact directly after receiving the parcel and sending photos. Paid extra postage due to needing them for the weekend.Told they required them back and allow 7 days to be processed. I get policies but when The product arrives faulty directly the day after it‚Äôs ordered and contacted within moments of it arriving with photographic evidence. I would of expected a replacement order to be released once proof of postage was provided.Seemed I was trying harder to resolve the matter than the ‚Äúcustomer care‚Äù agent I dealt with offering to pay for a better service and provide proof of postage.I was then advise to spend money on another pair and wait for my faulty goods to be refunded!One thing this experience has provided is to never use ASOS again and will be sending all items back for full refund."
"September 04, 2019",1,Dress arrived smelling of BO - disgusting,"Ordered a dress from ASOS online. No issues with delivery time etc however when it arrived and I tried it on there was a distinct smell of BO. I then took the dress off and noticed there were no labels on the dress. Took 2 washes to get the horrendous smell off the dress. ASOS customer services were less than useless and the best they could offer me was ""we will take your feedback into consideration so that this doesn't happen again""I've just ordered a ¬£239 coat from them also. Pathetic service to a loyal customer. I won't be back."

"September 04, 2019",4,Recently gone downhill,"ASOS are ok if you're looking for specific items such as branded clothing- they normally have sales and discounts. The website is easy to navigate and easy to favourite items to look at again. Delivery and returns are simple. It makes you feel at ease if you can return something you are unsure of hassle free. I'd advise if you're a frequent shopper to buy 1 year's next day delivery- it pays for itself.  Avoid buying ASOS branded products. They are generally poor quality. They issue discounts on your birthday and for holidays such as Black Friday and Bank Holidays so if you're not desperate, wait for a discount code.Recently, I've had to contact ASOS for a couple of orders. I got sent the wrong item and used my next day delivery as I needed them the next day. Had to send them back and told someone on the customer chat that I had been sent the wrong item and it was a complete waste of my time- they didn't even apologise for the mistake. He also said he'd refund the next day delivery- but never did. The other order I sent a pair of shoes back to request another size, I got an email nearly a week later saying I was being refunded even though I checked the website and the size was available. I had used a bankhol code and explained I couldn't reorder the item as the team member was suggesting as I wouldn't get a discount. They very kindly said they'd send me a new code- so I guess we'll see if that comes through.The only other downside is how long it takes to process returns or exchanges. And if you've bought next day delivery for the year- it doesn't work on exchanged items so its best to return the item and reorder (if you haven't used a discount code)The fact I was told I would be issued another code has redeemed my review to 4 stars- that may change."

I returned 3 items from an order that should have totaled a $158 refund, only received a $73 dollar refund, and the customer service agent I spoke with over chat accused me of LYING that I had sent numerous emails to resolve the situation. She was so rude, I could have sworn I was talking to a 14 year old child instead of a trained, professional customer service agent. Ridiculous. It's too bad, they have such cute clothes, but I will absolutely never shop there again. Buyer beware."
"September 03, 2019",2,Not great when things go wrong,"Usually quite happy with ASOS. But not so great when things go wrong. Had an item missing from my parcel and the jeans I ordered were a really bizarre shape, nothing like the photograph. Free returns but ordering a replacement pair of jeans means paying postage all over again unless they're the same jeans. Wouldn't expect them to cover postage if we were returning the item because of fit, but when the item is not good quality or actually looks like the photo I was expecting a better customer service experience. Certainly didn't end up feeling like a valued customer and I buy from ASOS often. :("

They didn't try to problem solve but instead abruptly said sorry that I was out $122, my tracking number didn't match, and they couldn't do anything for me and left the chat. I knew that the information they were giving me was wrong, as I had had ANOTHER Asos return that very same week that was ALSO delivered to Union City Georgia, and I had already received an email confirming my return and a refund! This customer care person was not well informed and left me feeling terrible that I was out $122. I quickly talked to another customer care person minutes later who assured me that the tracking was correct, that yes it is Union City Georgia, and that I would receive my refund soon. I am absolutely baffled at why my initial experience with the first chat went that way it did. Luckily another person helped solve my problem."

I even contacted the team with my proof of return asking if my exchange could be processed.

No driver show up and no one buzz at the door and i received a notify the driver did not find anyone at home. What?so i immediately send an email and wrote in chat same answer they need to contact the driver.

"September 02, 2019",1,Extremely Poor,"Extremely unimpressed by the poor service provided by ASOS. I purchased around ¬£100 worth of items from them, and sent it back through MyHermes. At the time of sending it back, I had accidentally misplaced the receipt. Unfortunately my items were never returned, so I contacted ASOS to find out where it was. I explained to them I didn‚Äôt have the tracking receipt, therefore asked ASOS to provide me with the Myhermes billing reference so I could then go back to Myhermes to retrieve the tracking number. ASOS pathetic response that they did not have the billing reference, even though every item, every transaction and interaction will be logged, dated, timestamped in nanoscopic forensic detail within the comprehensive ASOS IT databases. Therefore ASOS would have had full details of the returns tracking number. ASOS then had the audacity to blame me for the loss of the package and would not take any responsibility for the loss. Clearly there is some issues on ASOS end, and that they don‚Äôt want to admit to.  I have lost around ¬£100 of my hard earned cash, which I am very angry about. I have lost a lot of faith in ASOS and they clearly demonstrate they are more interested in snatching peoples money instead of their customers needs. Wouldn't recommend buying from them- Absolute SCUMBAGS"

They wont refund next day delivery charge and provide no evidence that delivery was attempted despite the fact our front window looks right over the entrance of the building. I know this is Hermes and not ASOS but for ASOS not to refund my next day delivery and accept these lies without any attempt to rectify and offer refund of charges which I have paid them, they deserve 1 star."
"September 01, 2019",1,Received items,"Received items. After 6 weeks and 5 wears, A dress wore really quickly and the thread unravelled leaving a noticeable hole and hem drop.

"August 30, 2019",1,The worst customer service I have ever experienced,"I am absolutely fuming after my most recent experience with ASOS customer service. After being a frequent customer for a number of years, I had countless issues with my most recent orders. I contacted their customer service on Twitter, on Facebook, on email and on their website via live chat and each time was dismissed, patronised and belittled. None of their advisers seem to have any desire to actually help or resolve any issues. Their first approach to a complaint is to blame the customer which I feel is an absolutely disgraceful way to treat a customer. Once they have your money they do not care. After contacting customer service on literally every avenue they offer and being ignored, I returned orders after the 28 day time period. As a disabled person it is not easy for me to get to a store to return the collect + parcels so I therefore waited to be advised by customer services so I didn't have to make multiple journeys to the shop. When it became apparent they were just going to completely ignore me, I sent the parcels back and I am now being refused a refund. I have again had to contact them multiple times/ways and have now had 2 of their advisers tell me this situation is my fault, not theirs and that they refuse to help and they have ended the chat, not allowing me to even respond. Absolutely vile treatment of their customers. I have noticed the quality of ASOS own range/products drastically decline in the last few years and in combination with the appalling customer service, I believe this will be the downfall of the company."

"August 30, 2019",5,Asos cares about their customers,"I pretty much exclusively buy most of my clothing from Asos.  I rarely have any issues with my orders and if I do their customer care team is not only easy to talk to but always willing to help. They also listen to customer feedback. I'm a big girl and there was a time where there were these cute outfits that was only available for small sizes. I wrote some feedback asking them if they could also make these outfits available for bigger sizes and a couple of months later when I was checking their site, I saw those outfits in bigger sizes. I also see that they are making more of an effort to have the same clothing item in a larger variety of sizes. They also have more promo code sales than before. Honestly I feel that Asos is one of the only companies out there that really care about their customers and also willing to listen to feedback."
"August 30, 2019",2,Dishonest About Shipping/Receiving Date,"Upon ordering I was given a shipping date.  The shipping date has passed. Checked the shipping status and now they've given me another date, another two weeks out.  This has happened with other online retailers as well.  How are they allowed to outright lie about shipping?I will not be ordering from ASOS again."

Very rude person."
"August 30, 2019",2,Avoid next day delivery!,"Having been a customer for many years, I was very upset to have received my package 3 days late having paid next day delivery with HERMES the courier company that sounds like an STD because they are that useless at their job!! (I am guessing Hermes is the cheaper delivery company for ASOS to use, always cutting costs instead of prioritising customer satisfaction) This meant everything I ordered couldn't be taken with me on holiday. Asos the responsible retailer have kindly agreed to refund my shipping fee but wouldn't look into the case a whole week after my parcel was due! Their customer service is also very automated and relied upon macros, which makes things seem less empathetic and unfriendly. A little more of a personable response would be nice. I can also see they don't respond to their TRUSTPILOT reviews which is unprofessional and uncaring of them. Better get to work Asos."
"August 30, 2019",2,Not what they used to be...,"I used to have some fantastic clothes from the Asos Design range and felt like I could always trust them to have good quality, well fitting clothes. However my last 2 purchases have been more than disappointing, the fabric they are using feels awful to the touch. I would expect that if these where Boohoo or Missguided, but Asos Design I thought I could rely on. Ordered a dress for a wedding and a cute tea dress most recently. The Asos design flutter sleeve dress waas way off the colour and felt like a Halloween costume, and the tea dress came out of the bag so wrinkled and stiff I had never seen anything like it. These were not cheap items, at some point they were both over ‚Ç¨60 each. Asos used to be my go to... But now I'll find somewhere else."
"August 30, 2019",1,Reading all of the comments,"Reading all of the comments, sounds like ASOS has one huge problem to address, but no one from ASOS remotely bothers to read the comments and do anything about it. ASOS addressing you directly - are you ever going to resolve your horrible CUSTOMER SERVICE problem? Not only your staff are trained to reply as robots - there is no empathy or remote care. Just because you're a multi-million dollar company, it doesn't mean that you can ignore your customers. Never be too confident in your ability to stay competitive in the online space as there will be other much more capable companies out there who genuinely give a care about what thier customers think and will continue taking away business from you. And don't forget - at the heart of every successful business, there is a satisfied customer. If you're remotely interested in my case, you can check the reference 22030762."
"August 29, 2019",2,"Sometimes may be good, sometimes may be bad","I had mixed experiences with them, order a few times, and everything went fine, the last time, however, one of the items was not delivered, I had to go on chat and ask why, as no notification or attempt of communication from their end was sent, after talking with a couple of customer care agents I got a refund for the product, without any apology, and no explanation, only after insisting they told me it was not in stock, even though this was not stated when I ordered, and the item was available for purchase even during the time the chat with the customer care agent. So basically that was a lie."
"August 29, 2019",1,Awful customer service,"Awful customer service, pay for next day delivery later for a dress for a wedding I am attending. 4 days later it is still nowhere to be seen. I will never be using them again. Customer service team are unhelpful and rude"

I asked for help on a chat with a girl named Lilly who continuously said I'd have to retrieve myself. There was nothing more she could advice only to close the chat and say that's all she can say - giving me increased anxiety that the order I paid next day for - wanting specifically for an event this evening is now lost somewhere in Surrey? I live in London and am required to go find it according to Lilly - most companies send the driver back especially when its incorrectly delivered. This is the worst customer service I have ever encountered and I never expected from a company I so loyally use. Very upset.

I've worked a lot of customer service jobs myself and am usually very understanding but wow! I paid express shipping for something to arrive at my house 1 week prior to when i planned to move across the country. It did NOT arrive, and when I asked for a refund or to have the delivery address changed one day before my move (7 days after it was due to arrive) and they said over and over that they couldn't give me a refund unless I returned the package. I said again that I was moving and wouldn't be here to retrieve the package, if I was I wouldn't need to return it! I chatted with 2 different people who both ENDED the chat after saying basically I'm not going to help you goodbye. Truly bad service!"
"August 29, 2019",1,I thought I'd gone through to one of‚Ä¶,"I thought I'd gone through to one of those joke pages. The customer service was so bad I thought they were playing a trick. I placed an order, then a few days later got a text saying my order was delivered. When I told them it wasn't they said I had refused it at the door but gave no evidence. They then said they were keeping my money for at least 7 days, and were not going to resend the items."

"August 29, 2019",1,extremely poor customer service!,"extremely poor customer service!Why would you have a customer service department if no answer is provided and no solution is suggested?? it's a joke. also the poorest delivery I have ever come across online, tracking is non-existent and you are going to wait for a parcel endlessly, that is if it ever shows up. I made an order on July 26th, it is now Aug 29th and I still haven't received my parcel, representative tells me to wait until Sep 15th then contact them again... they might as well say forget about your parcel and forget about your money!!!Not recommended at all and never gonna order again"
"August 29, 2019",1,Extremely poor sales care team,The care team are useless when the returns process goes wrong or items are faulty. A company of this size would rather see you out of pocket than give benefit of the doubt to a good customer. Awful service with team members have no power to help genuine customers would rather take your money and point the finger of blame putting the onus on a customer.

"August 28, 2019",1,I'm done with Asos for good.,I'm ¬£225 out of pocket and Asos' customer service is useless. I will NEVER shop with Asos again. Yodel are also just as bad - they claim to have left my parcel in 'safe' place - there is no 'safe' place to leave parcels at my property as I live in a terraced house fronting directly onto the street. I didn't receive my order and Asos are dragging their heels in refunding me. I am sick to death of them.
"August 28, 2019",1,Don't bother paying for 'next day' delivery.,"Long time ASOS customer but have never needed to contact the customer services. I thought I would treat myself to the unlimited next day delivery, since I needed an item sooner for a gift. Two days pass and no sign of it and It says on the tracking that it hasn't been out for delivery. I'm really worried so contact customer services. I get through to someone called Evelyn, who is so unsympathetic to my problem. She simply says that sometimes ASOS gets busy and no one can look into it until tomorrow, which sounds like she's just wasting time to me. I have never spoken to such a careless customer service agent before so was quite shocked at how bad it is, and I still have no idea whats going on with my order."
"August 28, 2019",1,Joke is the only word to describe ASOS,Terrible!! It‚Äôs like ASOS collapsing before our eyes. It‚Äôs great all these lovely promotions but once they take the money it‚Äôs a problem to even get the goods. Next day delivery not honoured then saying oh they have up to a week to deliver. Customer service a shamble.
"August 28, 2019",1,Bridesmaid Dress Failure,"I ordered a dress for use as a bridesmaid dress August 1st with an estimated delivery time of August 8th. Order # 428194724. Never received a shipment notice. I received a delayed notification on August 8th so I figured it would only be another week or so. I replied back to the email over a week ago because my dress still wasn‚Äôt to me. No reply from ASOS, so I contacted their chat yesterday August 27 and was told I‚Äôd receive an update email in 24 hours. I did so this morning, but they were simply informing me I was being refunded 106 dollars because the dress I ordered on August 1st, shipped on August 3rd, and WAS IN MY LITERAL CITY August 8th OUT FOR DELIVERY (according to FedEx) was no longer in stock. In fact on FedEx the shipment still says it‚Äôs pending and on the truck. No longer in stock!! So they sent my dress back to ASOS, didn‚Äôt inform me that they had done so, and now it‚Äôs no longer in stock so I‚Äôm assuming they shipped it to someone else. This is 100% THEIR FAULT. So if you‚Äôre on the fence about ordering an important clothing item from ASOS, just go ahead and don‚Äôt!"
"August 28, 2019",1,Been on the phone to Asos to enquire‚Ä¶,"Been on the phone to Asos to enquire about my return only to be met by a disgusting customer service representative called Russell who apparently didn't like my tone of voice, and wouldn't be able to proceed with the call, basked him countless times could I speak to a supervisor or manager qnd he wouldn't put me through,he was more interested in trying to cause an argument and proceeded to question everything I said to him, until I completely lost my temper with him, Asos customer service it one of the most shocking experiences I have ever come across and I will not ever use this cowboy company ever again."
"August 28, 2019",1,Avoid,"Avoid ASOS if you actually want to receive your parcel.Been using them for years and even paid for premier delivery. However, they are no help when your parcel does not arrive and just blame their delivery partner. It has been 12 weeks since I should have received my parcel but customer services want me to wait for more days. They know fine well hermes are terrible but are quite happy to take all the money for this order out of my account and not give it back. Not using them again and I suggest others do the same."
"August 28, 2019",5,The customer service is outstanding,"The customer service is outstanding. I received a top with a pull on it, after emailing them they didn‚Äôt hesitate to send me a new one. They sent me the replacement on next day delivery and processed the problem within the hour."

"August 27, 2019",1,Shocking!!!!,"Shocking, ordered with next day delivery, item never came, meant to have the item 23.8 now they have told me that the item would not arrive until 30.8.2019, I said I would like to cancel the order and they have told me this can not be done?! No item, money taken off my account, 0 customer service. I will never order again from ASOS."
"August 27, 2019",1,Horrible customer service!!,"If I could I would choose 0, horrendous customer service. Paid for the next day delivery did not receive very important order. Waste of money and my time. Do NOT order with this company!!!"
"August 27, 2019",1,Poor delivery service,If there was a 0 star I would definitely give a that. Paid for  next day  delivery service from Friday still can't receive my parcel. They have the cheek to say they provide great customer care service ask and telling me that driver van broke down. Not even a contact number for Hermes. My last time ordering from ASOS.
"August 27, 2019",1,don't even want to give a star bit i‚Ä¶,don't even want to give a star bit i feel like I need to share our experience to hopefully help other customers ordered a large amount of stuff for next day delivery and it never arrived. constantly fobbed off saying dpd need to investigate .. promises the driver will be back to resolve 2 days of waiting in this didn't happen.. was told the signature on the parcel didn't match previous signatures from the address.. not to mention I wasn't even in when the parcel was meant to be delivered I am now over 200¬£ down as asos have told me apparently it was delivered.on me asking for a copy of the signature used and if the GPS actually tracked the driver at my address on the days he promised to come back and resolve the problem I have pretty much been blocked by ASOS they have told me to contact my bank for a refundI'm not sure if the way the have treated my case is aloud but I will be persuing them.I have read alot about this so for anyone looking to order with them don't as if your stuff of lost in transit you've lost your money for good.
"August 27, 2019",5,"Excellent Company, recommended","I've been ordering off asos for years and never had a problem, great website, not particularly cheap though, excellent return policy."
"August 27, 2019",1,Terrible company,"Terrible company, spent ¬£175 with them, returned one item worth ¬£32 and because they applied a discount of ¬£30 for such a big order they only refunded me ¬£2 for my item. Disgraceful and am dealing with PayPal to hopefully resolve this."
"August 27, 2019",1,If I could give 0 I would,"If I could give 0 I would. Order from ASOS all the time. Placed an order yesterday for next day delivery which would be today then I got a email to advise they couldn‚Äôt deliver as I wasn‚Äôt home, which I was? They then tell me it was delivered with a signature which certainly isn‚Äôt mine. Told me they‚Äôd investigate which will take 3-5 days but come back within an hour to say it was delivered successfully, clearly it wasn‚Äôt. Absolute joke of a company."
"August 27, 2019",1,ASOS has a really bad service,ASOS has a really bad service! I don‚Äôt want to order there anymore! I was waiting some information about my return and replace item about a week. I sent a question about my order. Then they wrote me that they will refund my money during the 10 working days and they couldn‚Äôt replace it to another size but I can see this size to their website. I spent my time and delivery‚Äôs cost.
"August 27, 2019",1,terrible customer service,"Absolutely appalled by the customer service I have received from ASOS.Placed an order of just under ¬£100 at 7pm last night (bank holiday Monday) and need to change my address as I realised it will be delivered to my old address I haven‚Äôt lived at for over 10 years,(yes I know this is my mistake) but considering I contacted ASOS  2hrs after this happened as soon as I realised to then be told there is nothing they can do about it,I have got to pick it up from my old address! What I‚Äôd like to know is what happens if the people at my old address say they haven‚Äôt received the order or are away? ASOS don‚Äôt seem to want to answer this question! Also why couldn‚Äôt my address of surely been easily changed as it wouldnt have even been dispatched at 9pm on a bank holiday Monday! So I now have to hope that I can get my parcel from my old address and if I don‚Äôt it‚Äôs basically tough?I have also been told when the person returns my parcel back to ASOS I will get a refund but again what if they don‚Äôt return?"
"August 27, 2019",1,Same story as most people here tbh,Same story as most people here tbh. Didnt receive in the time given. Shame
"August 27, 2019",1,Doesn't even warrant 1 star!,"Delivery from ASOS has been the worst of all delivery services I have ever received. I order a ¬£130.00 order on Next Day delivery, was attempted next day but apparently I was on holiday....(I wasn't). Called ASOS as needed to goods for the bank holiday, nothing they can do & they don't have a contact number for Hermes (Ludacris, utterly). Called them again this morning asked to CANCEL my order and get a refund as the goods are no longer needed now I have to wait 5 working days!! For a refund on items which I haven't received yet and probably wont. This is the second time I have had delivery issues with Hermes/ASOS and every time the customer services line are either not interested or rude on the phone. Safe to say once refunded, I will be closing my account and shopping elsewhere!"
"August 27, 2019",1,order problem,I have now 20 days from when I made my order . On Dhl's site is not updated the status for more than 10 days . I talked at Asos ... and nobody knows nothing. Ok guys... but I payed 200‚Ç¨ and I have nothing .... can I have my money at least back ?!!!
"August 27, 2019",1,Dissapointed from the delivery,Dissapointed from the delivery! I have ordered 2-3 times with the hopes that fast delivery will really be fast... It wasn't!
"August 26, 2019",1,Even 1 star is too much,"Even 1 star is too much. Don't bother wasting your time or money ordering anything next day delivery as it does not appear that they understand what next day means.  Ordered numerous times in the past without any issues,  but going by my most recent experience I will no longer be a customer. After receiving text updates throughout the day about rescheduling times as there was a ""slight delay"" I still do not have my order, and was advised by all of the very useless and unhelpful customer service agents I would actually have to wait 6 days now, despite initially being told it was out for delivery. Completely let down by asos as I urgently needed my order, but they are not concerned as they are still making money !"
"August 26, 2019",1,I wouldn‚Äôt really give them one star.,"I wouldn‚Äôt really give them one star.Received a gift card as a present, upon redemption it said it had already been used. The scratch part hadn‚Äôt been removed were the pin was so it hadn‚Äôt been tampered with.Four days later passed pillar to post by ASOS and still not resolved"
"August 26, 2019",1,To be honest it's not even worth 1‚Ä¶,"To be honest it's not even worth 1 star.  You pay extra for a premium service of next day delivery and when it doesn't turn up you spent half an hour trying to find contact details, just to be told it will be at least a 6 day service, save your money and go elsewhere because you'll be waiting for a refund until the next millennium!!!  Joke of a company and poor customer service."
"August 26, 2019",1,Asos has gone down the pan,"Asos has gone down the pan. Terrible customer service. Paid for next day delivery. Delivery wasn't attempted the next day or the day after as I was in and waiting. I've been told that delivery was attempted and a card left which is a lie and no compensation for terrible service which I paid extra to get next day. Generic responses from multiple people, seem to be fine with this quality of service, they don't care about the customer that's very clear!"
"August 26, 2019",1,Just horrible,"Just horrible, stay away from ASOS if possible, is not the same as it used to be , I‚Äôve paid for a next day delivery they telling me to allow up to 4 days why are we paying for the next day delivery then! They scam and their customer service is disgusting they are rude and not willing to help I won‚Äôt be shopping with them no more I rather boohoo!!!!"
"August 26, 2019",1,I ordered a dress last year and the‚Ä¶,I ordered a dress last year and the service and quality were excellent. I ordered a dress over 2 weeks ago which arrived within the specified timeframe which you pay premium for so that is expected.However the dress was supposed to be e169 reduced to e89 was a complete and utter rag. It was like something I could have bought in a fancy dress shop cheap and flammable.I sent it back 1 hour later and over two weeks later am still awaiting my refund. Customer service came back to me promptly but I really am disappointed with my experience.I ordered off ASOS for quality not a cheap and nasty low quality piece of Nylon.
"August 25, 2019",1,"Prank-worthy customer service, except they have your money.","ASOS has an excellent range of plus size clothing, which is how they keep tricking me into putting up with their terrible service. I order from them fairly frequently, seemingly because I lack self respect; the orders are always arriving late, as their standard shipping time to Canada is a whole MONTH. Then, when you complain to their god-awful CS team, they tell you to wait ANOTHER MONTH before they will look into where your order is. It‚Äôs a lot of ‚ÄúHush up and wait‚Äù which is a poor way to run such a large and established company."
"August 25, 2019",5,Blue outfit,I love this web site I‚Äôm a big girl.  The clothes I get off here always fit me and there. Fashionable. They make me feel confident  I bought a 2 piece.  In blue flary pleated trousers look like a skirt. And top to match  it‚Äôs gorgeous. So happy thank you ASOS   Keep making clothes like this
"August 24, 2019",5,Excellent experience,"On time delivery, good quality, real pictures and very fast money refund. Also great diversity (petite, plus size, maternity). Really enjoy doing shopping on Asos"
"August 24, 2019",1,"Same old story - useless customer service, steer clear of this dumpster fire","Agree with 90% of the posts on here. Customer service is an appalling joke. I had a similar experience to many of the recent posts. I have next day delivery premier service, have had for several years. To be honest, it‚Äôs always been a bit spotty, but I usually do receive the items within 2 days. While not ideal, this typically works for me as I anticipate it and order earlier than I should have to. I placed an order on Thursday, 22 August, hoping to receive it by Sunday. The ‚Äònext day‚Äô delivery service is always automatically selected, I‚Äôm fairly certain it was this time as well, but with things like this you can never be 100% certain unless you‚Äôre constantly taking screenshots. Anyways, Next day there is no parcel, so I log onto my account and see that expected delivery service is not until 30 August. Over a week past ordering. So, I think that surely there‚Äôs been a mistake and I‚Äôll contact customer service and they‚Äôll be able to help sort this out. That‚Äôs what customer service is there for, right? Of course, there‚Äôs no number to call, so I try live chat. Absolutely useless. I explain my situation, the rep tells me that I selected standard delivery so it is what it is (again, pretty certain I didn‚Äôt but can‚Äôt be 100% certain either). I tell her that if I did, it was a mistake, and ask if there‚Äôs any way to amend the delivery service as the order won‚Äôt be fulfilled for over a week. I just get lots of copy and pasted responses that are no help whatsoever. I ask if there‚Äôs any way I can call and speak to a person - nope, of course not. I ask if I can cancel my order as it will no longer be needed in a week - nope, not that either. I was advised that I can reorder, but half of the order is now out of stock so not helpful either.I didn‚Äôt feel like I was talking to an actual person. Every response was obviously just pre-written drivel copy and pasted directly from the website with no regard to actually remedying the issue. It‚Äôs so infuriating and I don‚Äôt know why they even bother with customer service if they‚Äôre not going to at least try to find a solution.Anyways. Rant over. Moral of the story: if something goes wrong, don‚Äôt expect any sympathy from their robot-esque customer service. I won‚Äôt be ordering from ASOS again."
"August 24, 2019",1,What a rip off,"Wow ! ! !  Premier delivery gone up by 50%, thats just rediculous, but nothing surprises me from this company any more, customer service.......i dont think so"
"August 23, 2019",1,If I could give no stars I would.,If I could give no stars I would.I've paid for the annual next day delivery. For the second time I have not recieved my items the next day. I ordered some items to collect at my local store 2 days ago and I have not yet received the my items. I have checked again on the app and now my order will arrive on the 29th  August. What a joke!!!!!! Also one of my orders had bloods stains on the packaging and I made a complaint and they never got back to me. What a shame ASOS used to be good.
"August 23, 2019",1,Items was never delivered,First time I made an order via ASOS and it was my definitely last one. Delivery never appeared although my tracking said they came over and had no access for 3 days in a row. What a lie. I've been working from home all these days and my orders from Amazon came with no probs as usual. Regret I tried ASOS.

Got told my order from 20th August will not arrive until 29th August! That is longer than any package I have ever ordered. Customer service is absolute shambles, no accountability at all for there lack of service. Cancelled premier and will never be ordering from ASOS again."
"August 23, 2019",1,Consistently the worst customer service of any store.,"Customer service has been awful for years, very distrusting of and disrespectful towards even the most loyal customers of over a decade. They don‚Äôt care if you pay for next day delivery and don‚Äôt get it. They don‚Äôt care if THEY make a mistake and send you the wrong thing. They‚Äôre rarely apologetic and basically just shrug their shoulders because they know they‚Äôre such a large company with huge selection of cheap items that they‚Äôll keep making money. But they leave their customers feeling infuriated and like their time has been wasted again and again. Whoever runs the customer service should be ashamed."
"August 23, 2019",2,Sadly it‚Äôs time to part,"ASOS I once thought was an amazing brand, love everything they did, everything I own almost is pretty much from ASOS but now that‚Äôs coming to an end and I‚Äôll sadly have to part away from the brand as our relationship has became toxic! Everytime I seem to order now they fck me over - pay for next day delivery... it doesn‚Äôt come or it gets misplaced, damaged or they claim it‚Äôs damaged but it‚Äôs stolen, I mean you can‚Äôt Put it all down to the brand but they really need words with delivery companies because most of them are thief‚Äôs or can‚Äôt travel something without damaging it and I can‚Äôt afford to fight for my money back all the time!"
"August 23, 2019",4,I've shopped with ASOS for years now,"I've shopped with ASOS for years now, and the quality has always been all round. Any issues I've ever had have been rectified quickly, efficiently and above standard. The prices for their clothing vs. the quality has always been on par, and they truly are a brand doing all they can for this generations fashion whilst having such a good personality. The only downfall for them is using Hermes, but this is adjacent to them and they will still do their best to help in these scenarios."
"August 23, 2019",1,I PAID FOR NEXT DAY DELIVERY,"I PAID FOR NEXT DAY DELIVERY, It states in their Delivery & Returns section order before midnight to get next day delivery. So ordered and paid ¬£5.95. in their confirmation e-mail said delivery the following day. Queried this morning via online chat and basically told 'tough' there are banners on website (I didn't see any) saying 'We're really busy and order before 10 to receive next day delivery'. Just looked again this morning no banners and in their Delivery & Returns section still says midnight. It's not the ¬£5.95 its the principal now, APPALLING customer service."

Meaning you pay 5 times the price of the product due to that and it‚Äôs not really convenient. As i‚Äôve mentioned this already happened to the last 3 orders i placed and a friend of mine had the same issue. Not gonna order again, because this keeps happening and i‚Äôm losing money for nothing ! After contacting customer care the answet was that there‚Äôs nothing that they cand do, even if it was their fault!!"
"August 22, 2019",1,Absolutely awful customer service,"Absolutely awful customer service. I paid the annual fee for next day delivery, and the ratio of actually getting next day delivery to not getting it is shocking. When I queried this with their customer service department, they said they couldn't tell me why my parcels weren't being delivered by the next day,  but that they could confirm they weren't even put on the van. I asked to speak to head office and they told me they didn't have a head office. I asked them what I was paying for if I wasn't getting the service, and they simply said 'they've just not been put on the van'. I've never felt so infuriated by a customer service team in my life as I have with ASOS. So so so disappointed."
"August 22, 2019",1,Worst possible customer service ever,"Worst possible customer service ever! If you're not super nice about everything (why would you be if you're complaining about their terrible service) they shut your chat off without answering you're query for ""offensive language"".

"August 21, 2019",4,Really good!,I always purchase from ASOS and can‚Äôt quite understand all of the bad reviews they get. Yes sometimes refunds take quite a while which is quite annoying but other places are like that too. A few times I‚Äôve received faulty items and they have been quick to send me out a replacement for free which has been helpful. I would recommend ASOS!

"August 21, 2019",1,Terrible terrible customer service,"Terrible terrible customer service and a terrible company. Ordered a vest on guaranteed delivery paying with klarna pay. Next day received an email saying they‚Äôve cancelled my order. After several phone calls, it turns out they have closed my account. I called them and tried to speak to a manager who said they will look into it for me then, I get this email saying, ASOS have decided to close your account and any orders I make will  be cancelled. If I email them regarding this matter the email will be closed with no response?!?!? Unbelievable and gob smacked. All of this because I want to spend money on their products?? They said that the decision won‚Äôt be changed and I can no long shop with them. Awful just awful company. They‚Äôve told me the only thing I can do now is go to the ombudsman service! Which makes no sense as I‚Äôm sure they get charged for complaints who go through. This company makes no sense and treats people terribly."
"August 21, 2019",1,Avoid!!!,"Avoid!!!! Like the other reviews on the page I didn‚Äôt got my item and they keep saying to wait a week more and if I talk to them again they say to wait more and more, even if you chat with them now and try again in 5 minutes they will say to wait one day longer than the previous date, to be honest I don‚Äôt think I will receive my item or my refund, I had to open a dispute with my bank as I have no chance to get my money back"
"August 21, 2019",1,Horrendous customer services,Horrendous customer services! I have paid for next day delivery for the year yet my order says it‚Äôs being delivered standard. I rang up to ask why and they said because you clicked that. When I said that‚Äôs funny as when you put your items into the bag and go to check out it‚Äôs already clicked onto next day delivery. He accused me of lying stating that never happens when he places orders and he‚Äôs done so loads recently. So very rude. Wouldn‚Äôt amend my delivery option and wouldn‚Äôt cancel order or put me through to a manager. My order hasn‚Äôt been dispatched so don‚Äôt see the problem but there is.
"August 21, 2019",1,Ended chat on me whilst i was typing,Purchased items worth ¬£300 plus. Had them delivered. Returned wrong fits through the Asda service they suggested on the site.Fast forward 7 days no notifications no refund. Contacted CS and was told to chase Asda as it's my responsibility. Long story short i questioned why i should chase them given they work for ASOS and i had provided this Charlotte agent with my return reference.The chat agent asked me to familiarise myself with their returns policy and ended the chat.First and last purchase from Asos. Shameful first experience.
"August 20, 2019",1,shockingly bad customer service,"I have shopped on ASOS for years and I used to absolutely love it. I even had Premium Delivery for 3 consecutive years. I feel the quality of Customer Service has plunged though. I purchased a belted dress and upon receiving it, I realised that Asos had failed to send me the belt. I contacted them through the live chat and the guy I spoke to, Darius, refused to give me a partial refund or a goodwill gesture, which I would have used for purchasing a belt on their website since the belted dress was out of stock. This dress was an End of Line Item so it wouldn‚Äôt be back in stock anytime soon. I‚Äôve had to escalate this problem through PayPal because Darius was absolutely useless."
"August 20, 2019",1,Not sure how this company are still in‚Ä¶,"Not sure how this company are still in business. If it wasn't for their longstanding presence and good reputation (until recently) it wouldnt be!Placed an order for my holidays on the 15th August, paid ¬£10 for their yearly next day delivery, Friday 16th came and it never arrived. ASOS use to use DPD who are excellent but they have changed to Hermes and they are HORRENDOUS! Tracking stayed the same even after the time slot given so i contacted Hermes and they said someone would be in touch within 24 hours. That time passed and no one had contacted me. So i contacted them again and they said they couldnt find the address (funny as its off a main road and its an old terrace not like its a new post code or anything, never had any issues in the past) So i gave them directions and they said they would try to deliver again. That never happened, the next time I tried to contact them they said ASOS had given them the wrong address. So I contacted ASOS to complain and they said they had given the correct address and that I needed to contact Hermes again, oh and they wouldnt refund the next day delivery. So I contacted Hermes again who said i needed to speak with ASOS (apparently these companies for whatever reason can't talk to each other) then suddenly Hermes updated with some random address, which I googled and found out its the ASOS returns centre (i hadnt been contacted or sent an email to say this was being returned)Every time i tried to speak with anyone from ASOS and Hermes they were completely useless and no one could give me any answers. I havent yet been refunded for this order. I decided to place the order again as I wanted these items for my holiday and shock, the second parcel also hasnt arrived!!! Absolutely raging. I use to order from ASOS all the time and never had an issue, its gone completely downhill and i wont be ordering from them again!"
"August 20, 2019",3,premier delivery is a waste of money,Always been happy with products fromAsos however I paid for the premier delivery service and have been disappointed with this. They use Hermes who take a week to attemptDelivery despite paying for a next day service. It is near impossible to speak to anyone within customer services at Hermes and in future I will either be selecting a different delivery (despite just paying for the premier service) or just taking my business elsewhere to a company that do not deliver with Hermes.
"August 20, 2019",1,Absolute Shambles of a company.,"Absolute Shambles of a company.Customer Service is Terrible!!!Ordered swimwear for my holidays on the 3rd August 2019.on the Thursday 8th August I went on the tracking to see where my items were it said there is a delay on your item and we will have it out within the next 24 hours.I Never received my item, I left the weekend to pass then on the 11th August I spoke with Kristofer from the customer service team who was no help what so ever, the responses and lies are an absolute joke. Basically told me I have to wait until the 20th August until they can do anything, I was raging at this point as tracking was updated on Friday the 9th August stating ' we are unable to deliver your parcel please contact sender' which is what I was doing when speaking to Kristofer. I requested a refund and he just said back to me ' we are unable to issue you a refund as your parcel is in transit to you' What a joke! obviously I had to reiterate the fact hermes stted they are NOT delivering my Parcel so why is he lying to me.Anyway, I didn't believe him so I called up on Monday 12th August and spoke to another customer service team and they were a little more helpful as they explained the reason I had to wait until the 20th was due to the 'contract' they have with Hermes which is an absolute disgrace of a service! He also told me there is nothing they can do until the 20th August.Today is the 20th August! I Have just spoken to Arfana and now she is saying I have to wait until the 21st August which is tomorrow. Not really sure what difference a day makes but on two different occasions I was told they couldn't do anything until today and now I am being fobbed off again! Company is a F**king joke. Customer service have no clue what they are talking about clearly!.And still no Item. Due to go on my holidays 2 items of swimwear down, as well as lost money! Absolutely Raging. We will see what there excuse is tomorrow. No doubt they will fob me off with a refund and a little 10/20% discount I mean what a joke of a company! if they think a refund and 10/20% of next order is ok when I have waited nearly 3 weeks for an order they keep trying to tell me is coming. At least Hermes have updated me letting me know they are NOT delivering the item."
"August 20, 2019",1,Impossible to receive order,"ASOS have chosen to use Yodel for their delivery company in the uk..therefore I cannot order from them as will NEVER receive a parcel. They only deliver mon-fri 9-5 so if you have a full time job you‚Äôre screwed. After trying to deliver daily, despite the fact that 99% of the population won‚Äôt be in, they take parcel to a depot miles away that will take over 2 hours to get to by train (I live in London and don‚Äôt have a car like the majority of people). Absolute disgrace. Basically just take my money for a month as have to wait for parcel to return to sender to get a refund. Fuming."

That‚Äôs 10 working days I don‚Äôt have access to my money to their mistake.

"August 19, 2019",1,Unreliable with bad customer service,"I used to love Asos, but recently they lost an order of mine. These things happen, but the customer service was appalling. I spoke to DPD who told me I had to speak to Asos as Asos had never sent my package to them - I spoke to 3 Asos people online to try and find out when my package would arrive, all of whom told me they couldn't help and to ask again the next day, and when I did, they said the same thing. They were also rude, shutting down the chat before I had finished. I sent 2 emails and received no response. Eventually I got through on Facebook. At no point did I receive an apology from anyone, I just got an automated email to say my items had been refunded. They didn't actually check I wanted them - I had originally just wanted to find out when they would arrive but nobody could tell me. It's really disappointing because I used to shop with them loads, but I've now found much better alternatives."

"August 19, 2019",1,Shocking Customer Service,"My order was meant to have been delivered on the 14th of August. However when I tracked it said it was delayed getting to the depot. On the 15th I emailed to let you know my order had not arrived I got told you would be in touch with Yodel. I heard nothing on Friday so I got in touch this morning asking for an update but nobody seemed to know what was going on. I got told they would investigate further and that they  would get in touch within 24 hours. In the meantime, I got in touch with Yodel who informed me that they had received my parcel open so they had returned it to Asos! A week ago! I forwarded this response and then I got told that because ALL the items in my order were out of stock I had to be refunded. I checked within minutes of receiving that email and actually 2 items are out of stock! Absolutely shocking customer service who cannot seem to be bothered to do the bare minimum. I most definitely will not be shopping with Asos again. No wonder they‚Äôve seen their profits plunge in the last year!"

"August 18, 2019",1,ignorant and incompetent staff,"Never ever speak to anyone from the 'customer service' team with any hopes of getting help - they are by far the most ignorant, incompetent and mentally challenged individuals I have ever had the displeasure of trying to engage with. They can never help me any time i contact them - tell me to live chat again later and then mid way through a conversation they tell me they are going to end the chat since they have helped me as much as they are able to - by far the worst service i have ever received - They are useless!"
"August 18, 2019",1,429584196 Order Number,"I ordered over ¬£100 worth of maternity clothing from ASOS on the 7th of August with an expected delivery date of the 14th. One of these items was a dress I had ordered for my baby shower being held on the 24th.On the 13th I received an update to say they had dispatched my order, and that I would be able to live track it via the Hermes link. Even now this link still tells me that Hermes are waiting for ASOS to send them the package. I contacted customer service via email on the 16th and was completely fobbed off. No explanation other than wait another 48 hours for the link to update. Unhappy with this response I contacted them again on the 17th via the live chat and my complaint was sent to one of the specialist teams to look at. 10 hours later I received an email from PayPal to say ASOS had sent me a partial refund, and my ASOS account showed that only 2 of my items had been resent to me (the dress I ordered for my shower was not one of these despite it showing as still in stock). I eventually received a very generic email regarding the replacements, but no apology or explanation about my 10 day wait for items that mysteriously disappeared, and no gesture of goodwill for all my time and effort wasted. I have sent a complaint email to ASOS but they are yet to respond and I am not hopeful that their customer service department have the aptitude to deal with any complaints efficiently. I am now stuck without a dress for my event, with little time to find something else I like and that fits as I will need to order online again due to limited maternity stockists on the high street. My experience has completely put me off using ASOS ever again; they clearly couldn't care less about their customers."

"August 17, 2019",1,Canadian Buyers Beware!,"Canadian Buyers Beware!I have never once written a review on a clothing company, but I feel like I need to put a warning out to the Canadian buyers. I ordered two of the same dress from ASOS because I was unsure about the sizing and wanted to make sure I got the right fit. My order total came to $150.23 and I was surprised to pay $45.08 in duty fees at the post office. Honestly, I was annoyed, but I was willing to let it go. That was until I got home and opened my package to find that I was sent two different dresses. The dress that I actually ordered, unfortunately, is slightly too small and so I will not be able to wear it. The other dress... well it's just not what I ordered.  So now in order to return these items, I have to pay $25.00, which is on top of the $45.08 in duty fees that I already paid, for two dresses that I won't even own. So I would pay $70.00 to not own these dresses. That just doesn't seem right to me...I got in touch with customer service and asked if they had any way to reimburse me for the duty fees or at lease cover the return shipping fee since they are the ones who sent me the wrong dress. They said that they would not be able to discuss options until they have the items back in their warehouse. So I'm left with two options:1. Keeping these dresses, even though one doesn't fit and the other is not something I ordered, nor would I wear.2. Paying $25.00 to return these items, and also not getting reimbursed for the $45.00 in duty. So pay $70.00 to not own these items. Seriously... Lesson learned... it is not worth shopping here if you are Canadian."

Of those shoes received 2 were very poor quality, and I likely wouldn't have kept them anyway. Asos makes it impossible to send an email or contact customer service in an easy and convenient way. The online form had issues and I was unable to contact them at all. Rather than deal with this frustrating situation I just followed the steps online and mailed everything I ordered back for return. Asos will likely issue the refund having no clue why I wanted a return or what went wrong. They won't be able to correct their mistakes. Guess they do not care. Low prices never overcome horrible service."

This item is completely white so I have no idea how someone could not have spotted it, they have just stopped caring. I have been buying from ASOS for 8 years and the standard has just been slipping further and further. I have let alot of things go, with regards to items not being 100% as I'm not overly fussy but to get period stained clothes sent to my house is another level. They should be ashamed. All I was told was to return the item and they would refund me, like they are doing me a favour. I wanted to know how this could happen and how the standards could be so low to be told it is human error. Didn't seem to see why I was so upset, I just don't want to use them anymore. The customer service is not friendly, very matter of fact and that's not what the customer wants. I had an experience with another brand a few weeks ago with a faulty dress and the comparison in customer service is unbleveable. They treat customers right and like they care. So disappointed in ASOS, they have just let themselves down with poor service and shoddy quality control."

The courier didn‚Äôt show up before 10pm and then I got a text saying they had been delivered. There was no parcel, no card and they had taken no signature. Clearly they lied about delivery, presumably so they could be paid by ASOS even though they didn‚Äôt deliver the item as required. I actually paid a premium for the item as I felt they would guarantee delivery.  Awful customer experience and I would strongly recommend that people do not purchase from ASOS."

"August 16, 2019",1,I wish I could give zero stars due to‚Ä¶,"I wish I could give zero stars due to poor quality, lack of communication, horrendous customer service, late delivery and ultimately the company sending an EMPTY BOX (which they claimed ""got lost""). I'd also like to add for reference that I have NEVER written a bad review on any company in my life. I ordered a few items for the first time from ASOS. One of the items I had to return because the material was like tissue paper, the other (a dress I ordered for a wedding) had a broken zipper. I had to return the dress and repurchase a new one rather than having a replacement sent out for me. I ordered the second dress at the end of July and was told that I'd be receiving the dress Aug 2nd. I came home from a trip August 11th and the package had not arrived. I then had to contact the company 3 times to get a straight answer on why my package had not arrived. I was assured by the first two that I would get an answer ""in 24 hrs"" (this is days before the wedding). Finally I was told by someone on my third attempt that the dress was lost, that they were out of stock and that I would just get a refund. I called FedEx to follow up and FedEx reported that the box ASOS sent out was actually empty, hence why they never delivered it. ASOS denies this, told me they would only give me a refund. No extra incentive to make up for the inconvenience. So I now have no dress for a wedding that is in two days and spent about 45mins of my own time attempting to just get an answer. Needless to say I would rather go to Nordstrom on Black Friday than ever order from this company again."
"August 16, 2019",1,Quality of products as well as service‚Ä¶,"Quality of products as well as service has steadily declined. I used to be a frequent shopper at ASOS but found my experience over the last couple of years nothing short of disgraceful. Any company that partners with crook shipping companies like Hermes cannot be trusted. I have (had to) place about 3 different orders with ASOS in last 12 months and each one of them had to be returned. Their customer service executives are audaciously snarky when you try to explain the situation and are of no use really. You have to go through a lot of layers of stupidity and unexpected BS before you can hope they get to the point and help you out. My recent refund process was unimaginably convulated. There is absolutely no reason for them to take 2 weeks to issue a refund after they have received a product back. Hermes' outstandingly horrifying services do not help the situation since they ALWAYS lose parcels en route and lie on their status update apps, yet ASOS continues to partner with them. ASOS is not irreplaceable, something they seem to forget. If they do not sort such fundamental operation glitches out, they will be phased out very soon and quite rightly so."

I placed an order and paid for the next day delivery as I needed them for Friday.  I placed the order on Wednesday morning for delivery on Thursday.  MyHermes called me on the morning of delivery (@ 09.34am) asking for directions, which I supplied and the lady knew exactly where I was, her reply was we will try and get your delivery to you today! The item has not been delivered and the tracking information states there has been a delay.  I am now out of pocket as I have paid for a service which has not been received and I also do not have the correct attire for our work event!  So I contacted ASOS on live chat this evening to be told they cannot process anything until the end of the day and to contact them tomorrow if I still have not received my item.  I requested that they contact the courier company to deliver and I will stay awake until midnight at which point I received an aggressive reply we do not have direct contact details of our couriers and like I said earlier we cannot process anything until the delivery day has passed, I am now closing the chat (thanks Mikey, you were a great help, NOT)! Complete stall if you ask me of course they cannot contact the courier as they are now closed and not delivering at 22.30! This will be my first and very last order from ASOS they are complete scammers and time wasters, I doubt I will receive my next day delivery charge back but hopefully will receive my order at some point when someone learns how to use a Sat Nav."

I've been enquiring about the package back and forth from asos to my bank to the shipping  provider and have been at it for a month. I've had enough of doing their job and will never purchase from their store again. I have been a loyal customer to their store for years on end now but not anymore.

"August 15, 2019",1,Absolutely rubbish customer service,Absolutely rubbish customer service.  Refused my request to add next day delivery to an order even though it hadn't been sorted or dispatched just because it was more than an hour since delivery had been placed.  No sign of the parcel within the delivery window or the day after or the day after that.  The event the clothes were ordered for had come and gone.  Courier website just said there had been a delay and clothes would be delivered within the next 24 hours - it said that for a week.  Asos website said the clothes were on the way back to them.  Contacted them for a refund.  First operator cut me off as apparently I was too slow answering.  Second operator point blank refused to help saying I had to give at least another 5 days for delivery to arrive even though that will make it almost two weeks late and I will be away on holiday by then.  They can rest assured I will never place another order.  Worst and most unhelpful customer service I have ever received.  Unwilling to do anything at all to be of any help!!!

"August 14, 2019",1,False advertisement,The pictures and title told me that it was a jacket and when it came it was a T-shirt. when I told costumers service that I received a T-shirt and I ordered a jacket they told me to send it back and that they would refund me and order it again. I told them that I would like to keep the shirt and pay for it and they could send me the jacket I purchased because I liked the T-shirt and I couldn‚Äôt find it on the site. But in the meantime I read in description of the ‚Äújacket‚Äù it was indeed a T-shirt (so they made a mistake). He told me that I couldn‚Äôt keep the T-shirt and had to repurchase the jacket. I simply asked him politely if that was indeed the jacket that I had purchased and not the T-shirt like I just had read in the description. He told me I quote ‚Äò it is the jacket.‚Äô If you are a good costumers service you would have told the costumer ‚Äò one moment I will take a look at it‚Äô but no. After that he didn‚Äôt even say a word. I found it out myself. They had 2 times the same pictures and title only with a different price. One was a T-shirt and one was a jacket. I took the wrong one. It was not that hard to figure that out. But he didn‚Äôt want to work. Really pathetic.
"August 14, 2019",5,Don't believe the bad reviews.,"Just got my package. Was a little worried because of all the bad reviews, but calmed my nerves when I seen people on YouTube doing haul videos from ASOS. My pants fit perfect, just how I like them. Super comfortable. Good quality. Got 2 day free shipping because of how much I spent. I also bought a sweatshirt. Super soft, also good quality. Will definitely buy from them again. Especially since they're so inclusive and have plus sized mens clothing. Will definitely be buying more from them in the future."

They told me they could never tell me anything about my order until 12 had passed.Paid for this order twice before , both said everything was in stock, they took my money ( ¬£200 each time so ¬£400) but then emailed me saying order failed and yet have not refunded me to this day.  Waited for an order 2 days ago and paid next day, came 20 minutes ago. Customer service was awful and I spoke to 7 different people. Absolutely useless. Then when my order came, the items were too big and did not match the picture. Colour was completely off !! Will not be ordering from here again."
"August 14, 2019",1,Absolutely Awful Customer Services,"The customer service department are absolutely awful. There is no human touch, robotic answers and seem to just keep going round in circles. Even though they were in the wrong that just did not care!!"
"August 14, 2019",1,Same review as others,"Same review as others. Paid for next day delivery, never received, tracking on gnewt is outdated, took two days off to wait for parcel. No one ever came. Opened chat with ASOS they said gnewt informed them there was security door that they couldn‚Äôt get through (mind you I was home all day no one rang, I have 24hour reception with glass windows everywhere and receptionist can see everyone coming in and out) checked cctv NO ONE EVER TRIED TO EVEN GET IN!!! spoke to ASOS about 6 times now. They keep closing chat on me as they can‚Äôt contact their own delivery company and they have to go by their tracking info meaning they couldn‚Äôt deliver it because of security door. Not to mention I live in canary wharf and gnewt depot is literally three stops away from me.. how ducking hard is it to deliver it on time? Happened more than once already. Definitely not willing to pay for it as I ordered through klarna. They can deal with ASOS themselves if they want, I‚Äôm done. Horrible customer service, very rude and useless. They act as if I owe them something instead of trying to help THEIR customers."

They never reply.I bought something and it was clearly in stock and after a week or more after I paid for the item they sent me an email saying it's out of stock. They did return my money but how can I buy something in stock and after a week it's out of stock. Come on asos what the hell ??
"August 14, 2019",1,Terrible refund policy!,Terrible refund policy you have to wait a week and half before they will confirm that they have received your items then a further week and a half for them to give you your money back.Customer Care very unhelpful you receive a cut and paste response fobbing you off.
"August 14, 2019",1,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!Sent me the wrong pair of jeans. Aware the correct pair were showing as low stock I asked if a pair could be held as it could take upto 7 days for an exchange to be processed. It was explained to me this was not possible. I then asked if I was to purchase the original item again to speed this up would they honour the originalSale price as since my order the price has gone up. This was refused. So basically I have to wait 7 days if I‚Äôm the meantime the item I paid for goes out of stock it‚Äôs bad luck and I get a refund. ASOS NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR MISTAKES. WONT SHOP HERE AGAIN!
"August 14, 2019",1,Terrible service beware when buying gift vouchers!,"unfortunately two of the ASOS vouchers i was bought for my birthday DONT work due to an error on the ASOS system. I highlighted it straight away, the first CS rep never ever bothered getting back to me. I've chased several times, they are aware of it but can't give me a date as to when it will be resolved. Didn't think they could hold onto my money indefinitely like that? Be wary - terrible service, terrible attitude and basically don't care less about resolving my issue as they've had the money for the gift cards so just holding onto it and not honoring them."

I‚Äôve contacted customer service SEVERAL times and they say to wait until September 1st for it to arrive; which by then it will be over a month after I had placed my order. The tracking won‚Äôt update; they say they can‚Äôt do anything about it. They also mentioned that on September 1st I can contact them again and they can look into it further. I‚Äôm not sure if that means they will refund me if I don‚Äôt get my stuff or if they‚Äôll just totally ignore me. Customer service has been beyond poor.

I recently made an order of a few items and once delivered half the items were missing. I informed ASOS to which they straight away blocked my account and refused me on a refund. When I didn‚Äôt even ask for a refund I wanted to actually receive the items. And so a couple of emails exchanged. To now I don‚Äôt even get the automatic email to say someone will respond within 24 hours. So not only have they blocked my account but have blocked my email address. So now I have no choice but to pay for something I haven‚Äôt got because I don‚Äôt want to have a bad credit.  Absolutely bunch of C**ts!
"August 13, 2019",1,company does not take responsibility for their wrong doings!!!,I ordered 6 shirts and only 2 of them were correct. when I contacted customer support they just blamed it on me and did nothing to help me at all. the customer service people seriously have 2 brain cells and are very uncooperative.

This included asos brand heels and pencil skirts. I was even hesitant at my suggested shoe size because it was smaller than normal - but they fit! My order was fulfilled correctly and delivered faster than expected.
"August 13, 2019",1,Appalling Quality,"Just received my order of 7 printed T-shirts from various different brands that I'm not familiar with but the pics looked nice. On inspection, It's clear that HNR LDN, Crooked Tongues and New Love Club are actually the same company selling shocking quality T-shirts at rip off prices. The material (although advertised as 100% cotton) was so rough it left my skin itching after trying on. All the T-shirts were clearly identical size, style and fabric with similar cheap labels sewn in. I laid them on top of each other and they were the same T-shirts with different prints. I would expect better from a market trader and had I gone somewhere like Primark could have gotten better quality and twice as many. It can't be a coincidence that 3 different companies use the exact same T-shirt producer for their T-shirts. Its a con. For one of these T-shirts I paid 25 quid.The sizes were ridiculous! I'm a big guy, 6 foot, 16 stone and on the fat side. I ordered XL as would ordinarily buy XXL but plan on losing some weight so thought XL would be OK. Even though some of these T-shirts were oversize baggy fit, they were absolutely massive! It was like wearing a nightie and looked stupid. It would have been loose on a sumo wrestler. I measured them and the chest measured about 60 inches! I also ordered a couple of XL T-shirts from well known brands and whilst the material was soft the T-shirts were skin tight!The print colour was also different as the colour in the pictures looked subtle pastel whereas what I received was bright fluorescent prints suitable for a teenager in the 80's.  I'm returning everything. Fed up with online retailers trying to rip people off with shoddy products."
"August 13, 2019",5,Been using ASOS for a few years now,"Been using ASOS for a few years now. Really rate it, it is my go-to as deliveries and refunds are so hassle free! I pay for premier delivery each year and never have any problems, touch wood! Returns are easy, with plenty of choice of where to take the parcel and refunds are usually given within a week, so ideal. Clothes aren't always spot on but where are they ever! With the hassle free returns/refunds this isn't a problem for me. If refunds were slower it would be a different story.Recently gave Klarna a go and this was also seamless. Other companies should really take note!"
"August 13, 2019",1,ASOS! Gone down the toilet.,I made quite an expensive purchase on ASOS for an outfit for a wedding and my order was delivered to a delivery centre instead of the original address I had filled in in my order form. ASOS did nothing to try and help such as rearranging it to be redelivered! (How hard could that be!) ASOS used to be great now its useless! Monkeys could do their jobs better! Won‚Äôt be collecting it from the delivery centre as it‚Äôs quite a fair distance away and why should I waste petrol and time when this is their mistake! Terrible! Your a joke ASOS!
"August 13, 2019",1,"Terrible customer service, useless phone operators. Appalled.","I have been dealing with an issue with ASOS for the last week.I made an initial order of 7 items and when the package arrived, only 3 items were in the bag. I took photographic evidence and called to ask where the rest of the items were. It turns out there was a fault with the warehouse.They put in a query to the managers who would look into it, assess, and then send out the missing items and would take up to 48 hours. After 3 days I heard nothing back so called and I was advised that they would cancel the re-send out and I could just order the items again on a new order number and would be reimbursed the next day delivery charge. I did this. I have now received 2 emails saying both the replacement order has been dispatched and the new order has been dispatched so I will have duplicates of everything.I called yesterday with my new order number to get my reimbursement of next day delivery. It wouldn't issue it until it had been dispatched. I called again this morning after receiving the dispatch info last night. Again, there was another issue and I have to wait another 48 hours until it shows up on my account.I am absolutely disgusted with how this situation has been handled. No one knows what they're doing or knows the right information. I have found the people on the phone to be sharp, rude and unhelpful.I am a long serving, loyal customer of ASOS for many, many years. I work with very high profile people, I place clothes on them, I promote the brand and quite frankly have never experienced such awful customer service. It could have been so simple, but everyone has given me different answers. I have spent hours on the phone and I am now considering not purchasing anything from them again."
"August 13, 2019",1,2 day delivery service not next day,"I‚Äôve paid for the annual premium next day delivery and for the last 5 times it‚Äôs arrived 2 or 3 days later.

Horrible and not in the slightest bit remorseful customer service!"

I returned it for exchange and was told I would receive an email if my size wasn‚Äôt in stock or the correct item would be sent via the same delivery method originally chosen. I had to wait until two days after the courier said it was returned to ASOS before ASOS emailed. The email didn‚Äôt mention anything about an exchange, just a refund for the incorrect item. I went to the ASOS site and ordered the correct size again. It seems that it is available in my size according to the website. It should have been an exchange instead of me having to go through this process again. Poor performance ASOS."
"August 12, 2019",1,BEWARE!! CROOKS!,"BEWARE: NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ORDER MISTAKES. I ordered for over 200 $ of maternity clothing. I was desperately waiting for a pair of jeans to arrive. Instead, they sent me cheap leggings. I contact them, they refuse to do anything until I return the wrong item to the reimburse me. I now have to go through the whole process to get my money back, because they sent me an item half the price of what I purchased. They refuse to send the original item I wanted until it's done. The original item since increased in price, and they cannot guarantee that I can get it at the original price. I live oversea, I had to pay duty fees of 40% the price of my order and now I have to go through this non sense to get what I paid for. I'm also pregnant and growing each day, I cannot afford to loose anymore time with that. I wasn't able to speak to anyone, just chat, they refused to let me file a complaint/speak to a manager, and the agent I was chatting with disconnected to chat because he didn't want to continue the discussion. BEWARE, ASOS is a terrible company to deal with, I won't buy anymore."

Every time we call my daughter has given authorisation for me to speak on her account and last time we called we were given a reference number which gives me authorisation to speak..call them AGAIN today in my daughters absence only to be told there are no notes to give me authorisation! We are constantly fobbed off on every call (and there have been many) that we have to wait 48 hours..this has been going on for weeks and weeks..head office wont talk to me either as apparently that is a ""business line""? I have worked in customer service for years and i can assure you..what you receive from asos is appalling customer service! I will not be shopping with asos again!

When I asked why and if I can make a complaint the person said they had to end the chat and closed the window. Tried speaking with ASOS via email-same again really, just told I have to wait until the 20th August , and that they don‚Äôt have a complaints procedure and to check out their social media pages?! Terrible. Won‚Äôt order from ASOS again or recommend."
"August 12, 2019",1,Pitiful service,"The level of customer service is appalling. I have been a customer for nearly 10 years. The last three orders I have returned have not been refunded correctly. They have been withholding part of the refund and I can only assume it‚Äôs because they hope people won‚Äôt notice. Therefore I have had to contact them on each occasion to request the full, correct refund amount. Empty, standard apologies received however no genuine apology or explanation. Indeed, instead of focusing on the issue one member of staff took great lengths to write about my upcoming birthday and encouraged me to make further orders!!I have asked for an explanation as to why they are sending out partial refunds. They are quick enough to charge the full amount to your card when you order, despite taking days to process and despatch the order. Received some nonsense about processing items separately, even though it was the same order and items I had returned were in the same parcel as those which I had already received a refund for.Asked for a manager to contact me and again asked for an explanation. Completely ignored.My last order came with gaping holes in the bag, big enough for items to fall out. They can‚Äôt blame the courier as when opened the order the despatch note inside was in 3 pieces because of the lack of care whoever packed it has taken.Final order has been sent back. Account will be closed as soon as I have my refund.It‚Äôs a shame, ASOS was good however they clearly have no concern for their customers so I will move on elsewhere!"
"August 12, 2019",1,ASOS return/refund procedures are a‚Ä¶,"ASOS return/refund procedures are a total mess! There online system via your personal account does not give you a return label. Based on my personal experience they have two different kinds of procedures which confuses a customer. I followed the one printed on its invoice. It's been 14 days since I have created a return. No feedback at all. ASOS has great free shipping paired with a monstrous nightmare for returns. Non responsive customer service. You need to follow them up. Every time you do you get to start all over again about your items, order number, product number, etc. I discourage anyone buying from this brand. It's marketing of easy, hassle free returns is a complete sham. Hey, you gotta experience it yourself how ineffective their returns are."
"August 12, 2019",1,Customer Care and accountability sucks!,I love the fact Asos has trendy and a variety of clothing but they are much cheaper on other sites as well as I am signed up for Premier delivery meaning my orders should arrive in 2 business days express subscription all of my last 3 orders have not arrived within the 2 business days and my latest order is now two weeks late for an important event not only will Asos not be accountable for this saying it's the shipping partners fault (not true) they are not offering a refund or discounts or anything their customer care service sucks and will lose me as a valued consumer as I been for 9 years.

I ordered a return label from their website and payed for it. But when I opened the return label document, it was for the postal service in my neighbor country. I'm from Norway, and the label was for Sweden. I contacted their customer service and all they said was ""sorry, contact your local post office and ask them for help"". What was I supposed to do? ""Hey, Norwegian post office, I have this Swedish return label I would like to convert into a Norwegian one."" My money is lost and I had to pay for a new correct return label..Today I also contacted them about a lost package, and their respons were ""we cant track it, you just have to wait"". I told them that the invoice for the package is due soon, and I don't want to pay for something I have not received. And they literally said ""I can't do anything to help you."" LIKE WHAT.

ASOS directed me to dpd and dpd bounced me back to Asos. I finally got an email saying that the collection point I had chosen was either no longer trading, closed or didn‚Äôt accept dpd parcels anymore! After many, many more live chat conversations I managed to get the order shipped back to Asos for a refund, as I was no longer in London by this point so had no way of picking it up from anywhere. I finally got my refund through and they didn‚Äôt refund me for the postage!!! Back on the live chat I managed to get that sorted out. So what have Asos offered me for my troubles you ask? Nothing, nada, zilch. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not in our policy‚Äù well I think you need to change your policy and your customer care because it‚Äôs just plain awful. That order was for a hen do which is why I needed it when I needed it. It‚Äôs such a shame because the clothes are great.

I love the ASOS app, the variety of clothing and brands but man when there is some kind of issue you need their help with- forget about it.They con you with Spend and Save codes that I just found out mean you will not get a proper refund if you need it (this info is also really hard to find on the site). For two T-shirt‚Äôs I purchased during this sale (valued at $25 each) I received a $2.62 total refund. I thought oh wow, they must have made some mistake. Back and forth to the drones that they employ on the chat who do not give a s**t about your problem and actually ignored me when I said I was extremely unhappy with their service. I then proceeded to email them and even include their C.E.O in their email. Both times I received a drone on message that they‚Äôre sorry ‚ÄòI MISSED‚Äô the information about returns with spend and save and that there‚Äôs nothing I can do. $2.62 does not even cover the postage I paid to send the T-shirt‚Äôs back. You‚Äôd think they would have seen this or after having received my complaint credited my account so I could at least exchange the items instead and not lose out, or at least offer me a discount code. I told them I won‚Äôt be shopping with them again and they just wrote the same email back to me in riddles of the basic message ‚ÄúWE DON‚ÄôT GIVE A S**T‚ÄùThanks A*SE-OS"
"August 09, 2019",1,ASOS has gone down hill,"ASOS has gone down hill. Customer service is very, very poor. They are happy to take your money but not too happy to resolve your problem. Online customer service operatives are like robots who just repeat the same old scripted, standard, below par customer service responses. If you do not receive your order their response is to tell you to take it up with the delivery service(s) they use. Pointless and unhelpful. I have shopped with ASOS for years but sick of having issues with receiving wrong orders, wrong sizes or not actually receiving my goods. Oh and now if you return products to them because they have made a mistake e.g. wrong size, colour or a totally different ptoduct, don't expect a refund anytime soon as it takes ages to get your money back due to their new policy (they do have a return policy but interestingly no complaints policy so it seems). Make sure you keep your return receipts as proof of sending products back as they will try to make out they have not received  them. It never used to be this way. Too much hassle when there are other online stores who fulfil their obligations and offer better products and a greater quality customer service. ASOS are struggling at the moment in this current, competitive market. And boy does it show. I hope others have a better experience than i have had recently if they decide to make an informed choice and choose to shop with ASOS. Good luck!"

Also the customer service is the worst. There is no phone number to call and the employee I chatted with was rude and didn't help in the slightest bit. This was my first and last time ordering anything from ASOS.
"August 08, 2019",1,Not worth it,"I ordered with standard shipping, my item was supposed to arrive by the 6th. On the 7th I contacted customer service because I did not receive the order and my Fedex tracking number had not been updated at all since the 2nd. They told me to wait until the 15th to see if my order comes in and if not, then to contact them then. I would have never placed the order in the first place if I knew how long shipping would take and how little information I would receive about where my order is. I emailed them about cancelling the order but instead was told yet again to wait until the 15th and it was out of their control. The email I received was passive aggressive despite the fact that I wasn't blaming anyone and just wanted to get my money back for the order I hadn't received. ""I'm sorry you were asked to wait"". Yes, it IS frustrating being told to wait over and over again when you have already been billed yet have no idea about the whereabouts of your order. I wish I would have read the reviews before shopping here."
"August 08, 2019",3,Slow shipping :/,sooo shipping time is bad considering it‚Äôs coming from the UK. I had a package that was expected to arrive on the 9th but was pushed back to the 16th. The products themselves are pretty good but get ready to wait a while for your package. It‚Äôs a shame because Boohoo shipping is way faster than ASOS.
"August 08, 2019",1,CHEAP AND UGLY,"I ordered two dresses and a hat from ASOS, to Canada. Although the tracking link did not work AT ALL, the package arrived right on scheduled date. The box was damaged pretty badly but did not affect contents. The boat hat is cute enough for $25. The dresses were so CHEAP and UGLY, and thin, and literally I wouldn't have paid $5 in a sale bin. Now I have to pay $22 to return them. BOOO ASOS!! ASOS Design shirred bustier mini skater dress Product: 7887673ASOS Design mini sundress with buton front Product 8098534"
"August 08, 2019",1,Do Not purchase anything from ASOS,"Do Not purchase anything from this company!!! I have purchased items from ASOS and needed to return an item which I was given the instructions on there chat line on how the return process was, which I completely followed. Well it has been over two weeks and I still haven't received my refund, so I decided to do another online chat the company's rep. by the name of Millie who was very rude and   had me on a 22 minutes hold. To make a long story short. They refuse to refund me my hard earned money back since they couldn't locate my return item. So do yourselves a favor and avoid that happening to you and everyone you know. As for me, I will not be shopping on ASOS website ever again...."
"August 08, 2019",1,Possibly the worst customer service i‚Ä¶,Possibly the worst customer service i have experienced. They have zero interest when you contact them and no desire to assist to locate an order that is missing. Close the chat and tell you that they are finished with you.Lie and refuse to give out the specialist teams number  who actually speak to you on the phone and are helpful and friendly. No wonder they are losing so much business and they are only about the money.

I wasted 2 hours scrolling through 4800 bikinis only to find out the ones I picked sizes 6-10 were all sold out. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME. And besides this, last week I picked a bikini and put it in my basket and it SOLD OUT WHILE I STILL HAD IT IN MY BASKET!!!?  ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE SHOP - NOT ORGANIZED IN REGARDS TO STOCKS AND HAVE A PATHETIC ONLINE SYSTEM.  Won't be using EVER AGAIN."
"August 08, 2019",1,Bad service,They sent me wrong item again. Their customer service is not a customer service since they tald me just to send it back. But the refund is not free anymore. This is not the first time I have these kind of issues only with ASOS!!

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs such a shame that their delivery and customer service lets them down so much. I recently ordered some jeans and paid ¬£6 extra for next day delivery, I then waited 3 more days and still they had not been delivered. ASOS told me that they had a communication problem with the Hermes delivery service, this is understandable but from such a big company I really expected more. It‚Äôs now been 5 days and still no parcel. Absolutely ridiculous.severely p*ssed off with this now. F**king fuming."
"August 08, 2019",1,Cheap and sizing was way off,"I ordered some shoes and they were all cheaply made and completely the wrong size. I'm sure they were made in China and when they say Size 4 USD, don't believe them. They were not size 4 USD (probably European sizing) and they were all slightly different in fit, but mostly about 2 sizes too large. I got a refund but can't quite figure out why it didn't match what I paid except they must have taken out $ for return shipping? Maybe it's because of a currency difference (but not worth quibbling over)? Their receipt was very confusing. I would not trust buying anything with them again. Oh, and the items were poorly packaged with a box that was smashed in and another pair came in a loose bag with no padding at all! I'm shocked they weren't damaged."

"August 07, 2019",1,Refund,"I have been a loyal customer with ASOS for over 10 years, and have never really had any issues until recently.  2 day shipping now takes over a week, and when I query they just email and say I didn't enter the promo code, even though I know I did.  My last order was the worst experience.  I ordered quite a lot of clothes, returned the majority of them as they were the wrong size.  I personally packaged them, took them to the local UPS store, who did not give me a tracking number, but I was not concerned as I have never had a problem with the return.  Ordered all the items again in new sizes.  I have been in contact non stop with ASOS for over 10 days and UPS.  ASOS no longer speak to you on the phone, only live chat or email.  Live Chat just kept hanging up on me, and email they are not much better.  They just cut and paste the same answers.  End result I am out of pocket $500 and there is nothing I can do about it.  Terrible customer service and I for one will never use them again."
"August 07, 2019",1,Disgusting company,"I was a loyal customer for years, recently I returned my goods to them and the tracking number shows it is being delivered but they refused to refund me. Disgusting."

I have ordered more than I would like to admit and every single time the ASOS order is timely and perfect! Returning items has always been hassle free, usually the money goes into my account very quickly after I‚Äôve returned them."

"August 07, 2019",1,"Damaged item, poor customer service","Wow, didn't realise so many people had also had bad experiences with ASOS. My story: Fairly expensive item arrived damaged, with the item out of stock I was offered no other option than to return the item at my inconvenience, would have kept the item but do not expect clothes to arrive damaged and the customer service stance was unsatisfactory. Poor job from ASOS all round here, damaged item, poor customer service, couldn't be much more dissapointed. sorry"

Accidentally put an order through with the wrong shipping address so I ‚Äúlive chatted‚Äù an agent since there‚Äôs no phone number?????? Told me there‚Äôs nothing they could do even tho the address was in a different city and the house is now unoccupied, meaning the box will just be left to rot or be stolen. I asked if I could confirm credit card info etc to change the address but nothing. It hasn‚Äôt even shipped yet! Horrible."
"August 06, 2019",1,ASOS is THE WORST,"ASOS is THE WORST. Their customer service is terrible, you pay for express shipping, and then the item takes a full week and a half longer than promised to ship, they don't do anything to make these situations right, and their customer service agents are useless robots. Avoid at all costs. Modcloth, Lulu's, J Crews, etc.  - ALL better than ASOS. Will never shop here again. No wonder they make it impossible for customers to leave reviews."

"August 06, 2019",1,Liars incapable of basic maths - INCORRECT REFUND,"I ordered 2 dresses with a promo 15% off discount. One of the dresses (made by asos) was poorly made and didn't fit well, so I returned it and kept the other one.Obviously GCSE Maths is not a requirement for the people processing returns, and instead of refunding the cost of one dress minus 15%, they also deducted the 15% discount of the dress that I wanted to keep, meaning that my refund was less than it should be.I informed them immediately, even telling them the exact amount I should have been refunded, because I was certain they could not work it out on their own. I was told that they had issued the refund shortfall and it would be back in my account in 10 working days. 11 working days later, and no refund. After enquiring several times and being reassured that it was being refunded back to my paypal, they have now admitted that they LIED, and no refund was issued to paypal because they apparently can't process the refund that way!Now I'm being told that if I want my money back (erm, of course) I have to add my card details on their site and wait god knows how long for the refund. They were not apologetic about lying to me and making me wait several weeks for MY MONEY. This was their mistake, but they couldn't care less. I will not shop with them again."
"August 06, 2019",1,Literally the worst company,"Literally the worst company! I ordered a pair of shorts for my partner, waited ages for a dispatch email, I contacted them on Instagram to be ignored and then suddenly I received the dispatch email. When we got them they were like child‚Äôs size shorts so had to send them back, they received the item (as I tracked on Royal Mail site) but didn‚Äôt notify me, so I contacted them on instagram to be ignored again, so I went on the Asos chat and they said it can take up to 7 working days, however they hadn‚Äôt even sent an email to say they had them! They also only refund the item and not the postage which other sites do! Waste of time, There are far better sites and they actually respond!"
"August 06, 2019",1,Very Unresponsive,Both the website and the help they provide especially through live chat is really really frustrating.
"August 06, 2019",1,This is by far the worst company i have‚Ä¶,"This is by far the worst company i have ever encountered. My order was supposed to be a 2 day shipping but 12 days later the products never arrived. When i contacted the carrier, they informed me the package arrived to them empty. I immediately contacted ASOS and they told me i needed to wait 10 more days before they could help me. Every time I attempted to chat with customer service to inform them that the carrier had advise me to contact them, all they could say was for me to keep waiting like i was going to miraculously get a package that the carrier never even got. After the extra 10 days, all they could say was you need to allow us 24 hours to see what we can do for you. This is insane. I ended up with no products and no money. They literally stole my money and refuse to refund me.Please, don‚Äôt ever buy from this company."
"August 06, 2019",5,Super fast refund,"I'm really impressed with how fast ASOS processed my refund. I shipped the package back to them on Saturday around 12:30 pm. They received the package on Monday around 11 am. And I received my refund email just 13 hours later at 12 a.m. on Tuesday.Regarding the clothing, I don't like the way it smells. Sometimes, it has a perfumey smell. Other times, some of the faux leathers have a fishy smell."
"August 05, 2019",1,Asos is the worst!!!,"I bought a pair of size US 13 shoes online and I live in Canada, the shoes arrived after the established date and it came in the wrong size! It came size 12 so I started talking to an attendant on asos website chat, a very rude attendant. She told me that I had to pay to return the shoe since they are an UK brand so the size 12 is right because I have to adapt it to american size. But in the website and in the shoes there's nothing about UK sizes and all my life I bought US 13 sizes from different brands and I never had a problem before. It came written in the shoes 12 just that and on the website i bought size US 13! I tried to talk to her because the shoes won't fit me and I paid $36 dollars plus taxes for the shoes and to return it costs almost $25 dollars and they won't refund the price of shoe for me if I don't pay to return it but it was their mistake!!! The attendant was extremely rude to me and I'm shocked that a big company like ASOS hire people like her to help costumers, besides that the costumer is always right and I just can't believe ASOS policies in returning something that came wrong! DON'T BUY ANYTHING WITH THEM!!!!"
"August 05, 2019",1,I would like to leave 0 stars but I‚Ä¶,"I would like to leave 0 stars but I can't. ASOS customer service is totally unhelpful. They shipped my package to the ""Default"" address in Philadelphia, PA instead of my current address in Virginia.  When I contacted them to resolve the issue, they blamed me for their mistake and failed to take any responsibility and took no effort to resolve the issue.  When I told them I would be contacting my credit card company to cancel the payment, the customer service representative they shut down the chat abruptly.DO NOT SHOP AT ASOS. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE."
"August 05, 2019",1,Absolutely had enough. Loved ASOS once but not anymore,"I have used ASOS as my first choice of online shopping since 2000!!!! Yes all the way back when ASOS was As Seen On Screen!!! The last 12 months though things have gone from bad to worse and I finally give up. First there was the end of the ASOS VIP rewards, that they said would be replaced with a new reward system but never was, I spend ¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£ with ASOS so used to get plenty of rewards. Then there was the constant Hermes delivery debacles. Delivery times have got longer and longer if you don‚Äôt pay for overnight delivery to the point I have to plan a month in advance what I want to purchase. Which defeats the whole convenience aspect of online shopping. And now I have sent two separate returns and items that I returned are missing from the refunds and I cannot get a straight answer from anyone as ASOS. I have literally spent thousands of pounds with ASOS. (On average ¬£200 a month for nearly 20 years!!!!!) but unfortunately they won‚Äôt be receiving any more of my hard earned cash. Poor delivery, poor returns process now and no rewards I‚Äôd rather spend elsewhere. Shame because I was a loyal customer for two decades."

"August 05, 2019",1,I have contacted customer service‚Ä¶,"I have contacted customer service regarding a delivery that I have not received on time. I have a premier delivery sub and therefore also have an expectation that I receive my parcels on time. However, they are telling me that they cannot do anything unless they delivery does not come after 4 days of the estimated delivery time. How is that fair? When speaking to customer service they simply cut me off saying thats all they can do."
"August 05, 2019",1,Their web shop is awful,"Their web shop is awful, doesn't work properly, tried signing in with google, facebook no luck except the old fashioned form.Failed several times to place an order."
"August 05, 2019",5,Surprisingly ok!,"When I saw all these bad reviews I was truly astonished! I started shopping at ASOS when a friend told me they have an ok returns policy. I have collected two orders from them so far and everything seems to be fine. The size guide is also a good way to determine your size. The only instance when it didn't work was on an Oasis dress but my lack of boobs seemed to be the problem there. There are certainly problems with ASOS being a fast-fashion distributor, but while my budget is limited -  ASOS is one of the best ways to clothe myself :)"
"August 04, 2019",1,ASOS delivery,"I am very annoyed and disappointed as I placed an order on 1st August following a flash 20% sale offer notification. The order total was ¬£39 and then with a discount of ¬£67 became ¬£271. I had received a notification that my order would be delivered to a parcel shop as requested on Saturday 3rd August.On the morning of Saturday 3rd August I received an email from DPD stating my parcel would not be delivered but instead would be sent back to ASOS and I should contact them for more information. I called ASOS at 8am to find out what happened, the advisor explained he was not ure but guessed usually in this instance the parcel was damaged in transit. He advised the money would be refunded to me once they received the items. I told him I did not want a refund just for them to send the items! He then explained unfortunately I would need to reorder these items. I asked about the great saving I had made, which was my reasoning for placing a large order and he explained ASOS were unable to guarantee I could get the 20% off again.I was quite upset by this as none of this is my fault and I think it would be only fair that ASOS honour the discount I had given the delivery issue was nothing to do with me. He said he would put a note on the account. I then called back in the few hours later to find out if there was any update as to what did happen to my parcel. The advisor I spoke to this time kept me waiting for 10 minutes on the line whilst she contacted DPD to try and find out and speak to the depot. The advisor came back to me and informed me the parcel was too big for the parcel shop they were delivering to so it was being returned. On speaking with the depot she could try and get it redirected to my home address, but would need to send an email. She advised me once it had been picked up by the DPD depot I would receive an email regarding my order.I waited for 4 hours and called back as I ahd not recived an email ‚Äì of course, why would I expect a response. Where I have made complaints previously I have gotten responses from advisors repeating the same information and very unhelpful. On my 3rd call to ASOS on the afternoon of 3rd August I was told the DPD depot had not received the information in time and that it had been sent back to ASOS. I asked why was I not informed, again the advisor apologised. One apology after another. At this point I aked about the discount and can the order be replaced and I get the discount added over the phone and pay. I was told this could not be done and they would need to request a promotion code from the promotion team, which can take 48 hours for them to respond. It has now been 24 hours and I have not received any email to update me, though I will wait for 48 hours to pass ‚Äì I am doubtful I will be contacted. How can one order be so much hassle. The fact that ASOS as a company cannot guarantee me the discount I originally had for an order that was messed up through no fault of my own is pretty poor.Most retailers would apologise for the hassle and try and help, offer compensation or send you a discount code - but no...not ASOS!I have the premier delivery pass but have problems usually with Hermes and any other orders due for a Sunday delivery...i.e. they won't arrive until the Monday/Tuesday. I will soon stop using them altogether"

The last chat was epic - after 30 min. of going back and forth and trying to resolve this, they bascially wrote this (excerpt of the transcript):""[11:27:22] ASOS have ended the chat[11:27:22] As I have said we are unable to do this - I have now advised all I can. I'm going to close the chat now. You can get a transcript of this chat emailed over to you by clicking the envelope in the top right-hand corner.

Then suddenly I receive an email from them saying they had written to me before (they hadn't) and that I had returned too many orders and they would ban me if this continued! So they expect customers to just keep items with poor stitching or sizing that doesn't match their size guide?

I don‚Äôt need the dresses anymore‚Äù. And the lady so kindly wrote that I wasn‚Äôt there and it has been send - which was wired since I haven‚Äôt gotten any tracking number or mail about it‚Äôs departure - but she told me to wait until the 12th, so I did. The 11th I woke up to a mail saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre package has left our warehouse and is on its way to you‚Äù. When I go that message I must admit I felt so lied to, she told me they didn‚Äôt have it? And when it arrived next day I got the feeling that they first send it after I wrote them. So I went on the chat again and complained about the lie. They could have just owned up to the mistake and said ‚Äúsorry to hear so, here is a compensation or something‚Äù. But no no, he wrote ‚Äúsorry to hear, but there is nothing I can do - you have to sent it back to us‚Äù. This whole experience has been so disappointing and I must say I am quite furious, sitting back here with no compensation of or explanation on why they lied to me. So this is minus 5 stars in my eyes and I will not place an order there one more time."

They messed up a delivery for a week and guess what, refund takes up to 10 days only when they get their order back.The second person just shut me off on their chat.I was, that can't be right.Just thought I would share this, as it's obvious that ASOS isn't what it used to be."
"August 02, 2019",1,"Avoid, Spoke to THOMAS on live chat USELESS",My order was marked as delivered not received! i have a ring doorbell and no one was even at the door at the time of delivery. Spoke to THOMAS on live chat and he gave a generic reply as if he was a robot no human touch. AVOID shopping here useless customer service.
"August 01, 2019",1,I wish i could gave a zero star rating‚Ä¶,"I wish i could give a zero star rating for this company. They dont deliver as promised and dont take responsibility of the package to be delivered on time. They have the most horrific customer care representatives, who just abruptly disconnect. Please save yourself and dont order from this website"
"August 01, 2019",1,save your money,"Never again am I ordering something from this company . I placed my order to be shipped, express (cost $20 extra). Long story short the  Carrier  knocked  On my door to deliver it but ASOS also charges customs fees which was an extra $36 that I wasn‚Äôt aware of. I refuse to pay the extra charges cause I was notified of it. So they took my package back. So I msg customer care, they told me that I have to pay the extra charges and that they can‚Äôt do anything for me. I requested a return and they said that I would have to pay the extra charges first then pay to return it again. This is f****++* Ridiculous. Don‚Äôt shop on their website they have gotten  fees."

Every delivery I have had, and return, has been very efficient and successful and the clothing has always been of high quality. I also payed 9.99 for the years free next day delivery and it is certainly worth it! It has never been late at all! My no.1 place to buy"
"July 31, 2019",1,Please AVOID!!!!!!!,"Please AVOID!!!!!!!My husband ordered from Asos on the 30th pf July and paid almost 8 pounds for evening next day delivery (18:00-22:00). So today, 31st of July we were home waiting for the delivery. At 21:31 he received a text saying that the parcel has been delivered to our address and signed by my husband. Shocking!!!! Nobody knocked on our door!!!!! I went on live chat to asos. The lady who I was chatting was not helpful at all. I contacted the delivery company On the dot(subcontracted by city sprint). No answer!!!!! I called CitySprint. The robot said that the call is charging 7 POUNDS per minute. I was so angry and all I just wanted was soembody to pick up the phone to explain me what's going on. I spoke to an advisor. He wanted me to put me on hold while he was trying to call the courier. I told him not to take long because they are expensive and charging 7 pounds per minute. He was telling me that in no way they're charging that amount of money and that the robot is lieing. He said he will call me back. I waited 15 minutes and he didn't call me back. I called him back and he told me that he couldn't contact the driver that his phone is off. He transfered me to a department which whould be able to help me. I spoke with one guy who was saying that he can't help me. I am not playing when I am treated like this, when I am a customer I want to get what I paid for. I was told that the courier might have not been able to deliver it so my package was returned on the depot. He tried to call the courier...there was only voicemail. I asked him why do we pay a certain delivery method and we are not getting our package? He said he doesn't know. I asked him... if for any reason the courier is unable to deliver when it is supposed to deliver, why does he send text saying that the parcel has been delivered and signed for? He said he doesn't know. It is a joke. Please avoid at all costs!!!! Will never order from ASOS again as long as they use this useless courier company. Please go to stores for shopping and avoid having items delivered by this company. Customer service does not exist!!!! I am so angered by the treatment and the incompetence."
"July 31, 2019",1,CANADIAN BUYERS BEWARE,"CANADIAN BUYERS BEWARE. I usually don't go out of my way to post bad reviews unless I'm really upset. I ordered a cute bikini for $58 CAD on sale and thought it was a good deal with the coupon and they ended up sending me the WRONG bikini, wrong size and wrong style completely!!!! And now the worst part is they want me to spend $23 bucks on return shipping, essentially paying $$$ for NOTHING. Mistakes happen but shouldn't be on the customer's dollar when it is THE COMPANY'S FAULT!!!"
"July 31, 2019",2,Worst online shopping experience ever,"So here is my story (similar to several others who wrote a review here): I placed an order on 11th July, with expected delivery date by 22nd July. Today is 31st July and the order has not yet been shipped even. I wrote to customer service and they sent me an automated response saying I should check if order was delivered to neighbour, post office etc (this is for a package that has not even been shipped!), and that I should wait for 5 days and contact them again if issue is not resolved by then. I contacted them on the 5th day, but they said they would not follow up on my complaint before the END of the 5th day. So next day I contacted them again, and a few days later they responded, saying I should wait for 5 days and contact them again if issue is not resolved by then. This is outrageous! Are they really planning to send me an email every 5 days, asking me to wait for 5 days, until I give up and let them keep my money? I am now trying to get my money back through PayPal....Update: today (1 Aug) ASOS cancelled and refunded my order."
"July 31, 2019",5,Fabulous,Have used ASOS a few times and sometimes have to send things back. When I do the refunds are quick and easy and you don‚Äôt have to pay for them and you can often get free delivery when spending over a certain amount too. I bought some clothes last week and arrived yesterday and all of them fit. Was very pleased with the quality of the clothes and will of course buy from there again üòä
"July 31, 2019",1,Horrible customer service and always delayed with delivery,Horrible customer service and the deliveries are always late. Happened a couple of time where they messed up my order and had to replace it. By that time half of the items I ordered were out of stock. I did the order two weeks ago and I am still waiting.
"July 31, 2019",1,"Last update - Order still not here, no refund so far.","So, this is my last review for asos.com. I have placed an order on 16th of July that I still haven't received. The 100 euros I have paid were deducted from my card immediately.So far - not a single email on the status of my order. Their customer care team has not responded to my email inquiry and it's been 5 days. Their chat support just told me to wait until August 4th, and if my order hasn't reached me by then - to try to write to them again. When I check the order itself out on their site it doesn't even appear to have been shipped. The initial delivery date they estimated was July 25th - that came and went.It is July 31st, I have waited for half a month for a simple pair of Reebok sneakers now. Not a single email, or an apology. Not a single case where I was proposed some sort of a voucher for future because of their mistakes and the mess the site is experiencing right now.Total shitstorm. At this point I just hope I get my money back eventually."

"July 31, 2019",1,Horrible and rude.,Horrible and rude.I order a smart watch worth ¬£250 from ASOS .Their delivery supplier YODEL left it in a recycling box outside my house by a public pavement. The item was not there. Both yodel and ASOS refuse to take responsibility and I recieved an email from ASOS this morning saying that it's rare that items are not delivered and that they have closed my account. Also not to bother complaining anymore as they won't respond. Don't bother ordering anything from this company.
"July 31, 2019",1,Shameful don‚Äôt not order from this‚Ä¶,Shameful don‚Äôt not order from this company ASOS customer service is horrible they give you the run around when you send something back for a refund and you have to fight to get your money back . Disgraceful üëéüèº.
"July 31, 2019",1,Worst ever,"Worst ever!  I ordered a sweatshirt Jan. 23rd, 2019. Still not received. Contacted the company via chat three times. They always ask me to check with post office, other people in household, neighbors and areas around porch. Duh!  I‚Äôve done that and affirm it on each chat. They claim they will resolve the matter within 24 hours. Guess what they ask me to do? Same thing. If that had worked the first time, there would be no reason for another contact, obviously. Worst online customer service, ever. Never again!"
"July 30, 2019",5,Pleasantly surprised,Honestly I put an order in before reading the reviews and panicked. My order arrived today (to Canada) 3 days ahead of schedule. My dress is stunning and I got an amazing price on it. I feel like ASOS may be a bit of a gamble - but I experienced ZERO issues and will most likely order again.
"July 30, 2019",1,The worst customer service I have ever‚Ä¶,The worst customer service I have ever experienced. I have been ordering from asos for 6 years and have never had a problem before. The past few months there has been something wrong with every order. From being sent the wrong item at the warehouse to not receiving an item at all. To speak to their customer service team is exhausting with the same scripted conversation sent over and over again. There is no understanding of the situation at all. I have paid for something which I haven't recieced and they are refusing to refund me! Order at Asos at your own risk. I certainly wont be as I'm not getting a product that I have paid for.

"July 30, 2019",4,Never had a problem,Never had a problem with ASOS. I regularly order from there and the items always arrive in decent time and are of good quality.

The money has been withdrawn from my account but they claim the card declined the payment (after telling me for two weeks that the dress has been sent). This company is a scam. They took my money and now claim they never received it. This will not be the end of it. I will sue if I have to."
"July 30, 2019",4,I have been using ASOS for 10 years‚Ä¶,"I have been using ASOS for 10 years now. Of course there have been instances of delayed deliveries and items going out of stock in that time, but overall they are a company I know I can rely on.The quality of the clothing does vary, and I think they could be more open about how clothing is styled. For example when pegs are used to make clothes appear to fit better.However the good thing is that it is so easy to order and return items, that even when items aren't right, it is pretty much hassle free to get a refund. I use the Premier service so I get free next day delivery, and this is absolutely worth it as the service is good."
"July 30, 2019",1,ASOS TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I have been a loyal Asos customer for years and its fair to say I have spent thousands on orders. However in the last year or two I have seen the service level continuously drop. I was constantly being sent the wrong items, barely received my delivery on the agreed date and at times receiving really  terrible quality items. Im sure i am not the only one hence the overall rates on here being 1 STAR!My advise,  as Asos resell brands go directly to the brand to get the item(s) you are want because Asos service is not worth the hassle plus if you are dealing directly with the brand you will receive better service."
"July 30, 2019",1,Very restricted and pointless customer support,"Ordered trousers in my size. Unfortunately I removed the tags before trying them on. They were far too small- the manufacturer must have a strange size guide. Asos customer support were unable to offer me anything, even the slightest discount on a larger pair as a gesture of goodwill.Look, I know this was my fault, but the trousers were expensive (¬£50). Would it kill them to treat customers like human beings and go beyond what is expected of them? I‚Äôd have been happy with 10% off a larger size, which is what they give students anyway. The problem with big corporations like this is that greed trumps everything else. Not buying from asos again for this reason."

First my items (shoes for my wedding) bought 1 month in advance are not shipped because of ""a technical glitch"" at their warehouse. I mean what the hell. I forget about getting them, and I am relieved to receive an email that say it will be refunded - however I never am! I contact them and they say that I first have to return the goods - even when I explain that I won't be home in time to do so. I WILL NEVER NEVER EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM ASOS AGAIN!"
"July 30, 2019",1,Item sent back to Sender BEFORE attempted delivery,Order was placed on Saurday 27th july for a dress to be delivered amongst a few other items in light of a party tomorrow (wednesday). I selected next day delivery. It was out for delivery sunday at 10am. At 7pm an update from Hermes saying there has been a delay. Yesterday an update saying has been returned to sender. Where is my parcel? I ordered with plenty of time for my party and all customer service said is when we recieve the item back from hermes its 10 days for a refund in the meantime feel free to order again and when I mentioned I didn't have the funds.  They told me to use Klarna and pay Klarna when I am issued the refund.  I asked to speak to the manager and was told that everyone at ASOS customer care has same level of training so could not pass me onto a manager.
"July 30, 2019",4,Good shopping experience,Good shopping experience. Some of my items didn't arrive and live support helped me out. It took 1 day to process and they re-sent my missing items.Returns and refunds are also very easy.

I'm contacting asos for the third time about one dress. The first time I tried to return the dress was in May, but the dress came back to me. I contacted ASOS and they said to send again, so did I, but the dress returned to me again. Then I contacted them again and wrote this whole situation, they gave me a new label to send again and confirmed that I would get my money back. And today I received a gift voucher from asos instead of cash into my account. Then I contacted asos again and they said that they can't get my money back, because it has been later than 29 days. BUT IT'S NOT MY FAULT, it's post office and ASOS fault. Now i don't have a dress and money back. I don't recommend this page to anyone."
"July 29, 2019",5,ASOS- Budget Fashion made stylish,I‚Äôve used ASOS for over two years and quite frankly if I ever need to purchase new clothes this is my go to website. The quality of clothes is good and I found the watches really good value for money. When I first started using ASOS I was surprised at how quick the delivery was however after finding myself consistently using it I upgraded to the premium next day delivery scheme and quite frankly it‚Äôs one of the best value for money schemes out there. I highly recommend ASOS and will continue using it in the future.
"July 28, 2019",2,I had good experiences with Asos,"I had good experiences with Asos, and bad ones also, of course we usually recall more the bad than the good ones (welcome to being human :D) I made 4 orders so far, the first two went smooth and everything arrived as planned, the third one, was 3 jackets, one came with the wrong size, other was right and the third one I found it too big, so they told me to return and order a new one, which I did which leads to the fourth order where I order the jacket I wanted in XS, and I received a bag instead :/ I complain but they said well return it, I did and took a long time to get a refund. Since then I never order again, I get I was a bit off with 2 good experiences, 2 bad ones. I prolly will sometime soon try again."
"July 28, 2019",1,"Waste of time, go elsewhere.","Customer support offer no actual help to customers rather just canned responses so they can end the chat quicker. Excuses for week+ delivery when ""1 day"" is advertised, absolute joke. Order somewhere else, you'll save yourself the hassle for when eventually a order does mess-up and you have to deal with the incompetent customer support who leave you out of pocket and time."

In addition, no one contacted me during this month, so I feel very disappointed and will never buy the products of ASOS in the future"
"July 28, 2019",1,Awful customer service,"Awful customer service. Being online this should be so important but it seems with ASOS it's not. I bought a gift card and it doesn't work, ASOS still haven't sorted this out. Shop elsewhere"
"July 28, 2019",1,Absolutely shocking customer service,"Absolutely shocking customer service. Not willing to help at all. Ordered from Asos for the first time last week. 2 white dresses (getting married on the beach in september). Received my order. One of the dresses i recieved is wrong, however worked to my advantage because i love it. The dress i should have had was ¬£60 the dress they sent was ¬£44. All i wanted from them was the ¬£16 difference back. (I know its not much but its not the point). I was very happy to keep the wrong dress and just be refunded the difference. However they will not do it and require me to send the wrong item back for a full refund. Now if i could have ordered this item again then that would have been no problem, however this dress is out of stock online therefore id send it back to never be able to order it again. Will be keeping the wrong dress as its perfect but will not be ordering from here again. Not only did they send me the wrong order in the first place but they've gained extra money from me, custome service was appauling, i must have repeated my self numerous times, only to be told the same thing over and over again, very poor understanding and listening skills ASOS and unwillingness to help a customer."

It was becoming the end of the day with no hope left for my parcel to arrive so I thought id try the chat one more time and Paul provided the best service he was amazing with the reponses and reassured me both with a refund on premier delivery and making sure my delivery ""should"" come by tomorrow and he was a great laugh they need more people like Paul and less Hermes crappy delivery"
"July 27, 2019",1,Paid ¬£10 for premier delivery in June,Paid ¬£10 for premier delivery in June and I‚Äôve been unable to use it for 3 weeks because it‚Äôs just not showing up on my account. I‚Äôve spoken to them multiple times only to have the same automated responses saying they‚Äôre ‚Äúlooking into it‚Äù and it‚Äôs being passed around to different teams but nothing is happening. After asking for my money back for the service I can‚Äôt use they‚Äôve told me that while it‚Äôs being investigated I can‚Äôt get any kind of refund. The lack of customer service is a joke and the constant automated messages are not sufficient.
"July 27, 2019",1,Bad service customer care cant help‚Ä¶,Bad service customer care cant help anything. This site look like scam no Australia customer service also cant contact anyone in uk .
"July 27, 2019",1,The worst online ordering service there‚Ä¶,"The worst online ordering service there is, use any other of their competitors. I ordered a pair of UK 8.5 trainers. I got sent US 8.5 trainer which is a UK 7.5. I send them back asking for replacement. I get told I'm getting a refund. I order the trainers again. UK 8.5. They come as US 8.5 again. I called customer service and she said she couldn't help me. The call charged me ¬£6. She told me to just send them back like I did before and order them again. I upgraded to the next day delivery and she said I should have the shoes by tomorrow. I asked if the shoes were going to come in the right size this time. She said it was a warehouse issue and she wouldn't be able to help. Three transactions. Two refunds yet to be refunded even though I asked for replacements. Still no shoes that fit me properly. Waste of time and money. Don't bother."
"July 27, 2019",1,Well what I can say..,"Well what I can say... Before I loves ASOS, was my favourite online shopping website until they blocked my account.. also very poor return department service.. every time when I made a return they never received my orders, I had to go through the hassle every time before mailing sure that they received my returns... stay in the queue to be connected to the online chat provide proof of postage and same thing every time. Now I still have to make couple of returns but I can‚Äôt because they blocked my account without any warnings.. and I am waiting to hear back from them with an explanation but they haven‚Äôt emailed me yet.. worse company ever"
"July 27, 2019",3,ASOS is not what it used to be,"ASOS is not what it used to be, this does not concern their stock, that‚Äôs still excellent, a huge variety of labels and you will always find what you‚Äôre looking for. Their service however has drastically changed and I could just about ignore their decline because they‚Äôre one of the only companies that still send a printed return label in their orders! But once your order is placed you receive no tracking, recently it came through 10 days after I had taken delivery! But most recently I received an email from them saying that recently I had returned a ‚Äòhigher than average‚Äô amount of orders and whilst they weren‚Äôt about to act on this they wanted to let me know that their has been a high amount of customers that have been ‚Äòabusing‚Äô their service and items returned were not in their original condition etc that they had located a specific number of these abusers and closed their accounts, not to worry, they weren‚Äôt doing that with mine, What am I meant to think about this? I am a 47 yr old woman who will order a few things (always in the sale) for choice and return them if they don‚Äôt suit me or THEY HAVE CLEARLY BEEN WORN BEFORE!!! three days after I received this email I received an order I had placed of bra‚Äôs, it‚Äôs hard to find a bra that fits well, so I was pleased to find that both bras fitted, however one of these bras ( a Gossard ) had absolutely been worn, it stank to high heaven of B.O and their were underarm stains when I looked closer,whilst trying it on I just began to smell this horrific B.o smell so it wasn‚Äôt like it was unnoticeable, well someone re-packed it and thought it was good enough to send out!! The thing is, I kept the bra, despite it‚Äôs condition, because it was on sale, Gossard is a good make and it fit me!! That‚Äôs hard to find and I knew if I sent it back and asked for a replacement it would be out of stock because it was on sale,I‚Äôm not an abuser of ASOS or any other online clothes store, I have been however a victim of it on more than one occasion with ASOS but do you think I‚Äôm going to return something in the future and say I think it‚Äôs been worn? Absolutely not, because after their email to me it‚Äôs going to seem like I am guilty if I do, so therefore I close my own account with ASOS. Because I was so offended by their email, clearly pointing the finger in my direction that I no longer want to shop with them."
"July 26, 2019",4,I like Asos,"I like Asos. There, I‚Äôve said it. I‚Äôm a fan! Admittedly some clothing is poor on the quality side but generally (touch wood) up to now no big issues."

I have chatted severally with the customer service and up till now no follow up email at all. Really unhappy
"July 26, 2019",1,Unfairly treated with ASOS,"I have been shopping with ASOS for many years for both the family and myself. They have some amazing clothes and the sales are fantastic. I had very few issues until December 2018, boxing day sale, I began to receive incorrect items of clothing or sizes, damaged parcels, missing parcels or missing items. Sometimes the clothing would be faulty.Therefore, these items were returned to Asos for exchange or refund. However, refunds were not being credited back to the debit card used to make payment and I was having to constantly contact them with proof of returns, tracking number, items returned etc Some customer service advisors were helpful and some were not. Occasionally, in live chat and emails, customer service would not even respond or fail to understand what I was telling them.I explained to ASOS that I am disabled and some items are returned due to them not being suitable and that it was easier for me to try clothing on in my own home. At first, it appeared that they understood. But I was wrong. According to the ASOS April 2019 new policy, which I only read more about today, if ASOS deems you as one who returns items often then they can block your account! And that is exactly what they did to me yesterday without notifying me or giving any warning! I emailed the customer service team and waited 24 hours for a response but did not receive one. I emailed them again and have waited 12 hours without any response. I feel it is very rude of them to treat loyal customers in this manner. I cannot see my orders and can, therefore, cannot monitor two refunds I am waiting for. I have explained this to them in the last emails.It is very sad to see the company go downhill. They need to work on customer service skills and monitor the items being sent out to customers and ensure they are correct and not faulty. Another part of customer service which is quite frustrating is the standard messages from the customer service team, which appear to be copied and pasted.  This is all very upsetting and I feel I have been discriminated against as I have a genuine reason for my returns."
"July 26, 2019",1,Awful awful awful,Awful awful awfulAfter many years being a customer... I've never had a problem with asos my returns process was great and they sold tall clothes which is fab HOWEVER.... I ordered a big order of clothes before my holiday so I could pick and choose what I wanted to keep and return. My parcel was LEFT OUTSIDE MY HOUSE and I came home to find it opened. About half of my items were missing. I contacted asos and they BLOCKED MY ACCOUNT. saying it's a rate occurrence that items have gone missing and that I have to foot the bill!!????? It's not my fault their courier either opened the parcel and took stuff or someone from the street went foriging as its left out for everyone to see. I didn't even get an email to say it was being delivered else I would have stayed in. After so many years of service as soon as i have a issue they dont care. They block your account and REFUSE to talk to you about the matter. Honestly never ever expected such rubbish customer service from a business.
"July 26, 2019",1,Honestly this is the worst customer‚Ä¶,Honestly this is the worst customer service I have encountered. The staff have no knowledge and seem unable to help. Emails about returns are erratic and they just quote 7 working days and refuse to help. I'm not using these again as they are very poor at customer service.
"July 26, 2019",1,They screwed up my order and took them‚Ä¶,"They screwed up my order and took them 3months to figure out that they didn't even ship it. Second time DHL harmed my package and it had to be sent back and repacked- it was supposedly delivered BUT GUESS WHAT I NEVER RECIEVED IT! Their support team sucks a55 and that is said nicely. Don't even get my started on the German support team for ASOS. They don't even have people that speak English. Nobody could help me. To sum it up, F YOU ASOS and your sh1tty empolyes"
"July 26, 2019",1,Can I give 0 stars?,"I placed an order on Asos yesterday and paid for Premier Delivery ¬£10 so I can get it today. My order arrived and I got a different dress!! I really needed the dress I have ordered for a wedding, that‚Äôs why I paid extra ! I spoke to someone from customer service and she said to return the wrong dress and order the good one again! I told her I can‚Äôt do this and to send me the dress again and I will return this one. They refused! I‚Äôm so upset!! I asked her what do I get in return for this mistakes and she said nothing!!! Great, I‚Äôll keep ordering that dress again and hoping to eventually get the right one.   I‚Äôm so dissapointed with this company! I will never ever order from them again!"
"July 26, 2019",1,Shambles.,"Horrible experience from start to finish, at no stage, will they be helpful or offer you compensation."
"July 26, 2019",1,Horrible experience!,"I don't know if anyone actually reads the messages from ASOS because I've sent 2 emails to customer care and I have been ignored like I don't exist! But IF there is anyone reading this, I would like to express my sheer displeasure in your services. I have placed orders on several items from you within the last few weeks. So far I have only received one package, 3 weeks after it was scheduled to be here. Upon opening the package I discovered that the orders were wrong. Ordered a calvin klein TOTE and PAID for a tote and instead got a cross body bag which I'm sure is of much less value!! Clothes are so pathetically small, it wouldn't fit a tooth pick, and I am a very petite woman so that says a lot! Unwearable unless I lose 10kg!! I ordered gold clips and got silver. I am dreading the arrival of my other packages as I'm certain they too will be a disappointment. I live in South Africa so the nightmare of trying to return these items won't be worth the headache. Not that I can even get hold of anyone in customer service! Keep it up, ASOS. At this rate you will be a flash in the pan company who won't exist in a year! Your clothes look beautiful on the website, the prices seem fair, I would have continued to be a loyal customer if my experience had been different but I will never again support your organisation. Quick to take the money but no attention to detail on customer orders and no customer service either. I am beyond disappointed!Ps: I only have one star because there wasn't an option to give none. I hope people learn fast and stop supporting places like this with their hard earned money."
"July 26, 2019",1,If I could give it less I would,If I could give it less I would! Ordered a few items on the 19th July and was told they would be delivered by 24th July and no later. The day came and went. I contacted ASOS to be told that there has been a delay and I now need to wait until the 2nd August and they can't do anything until then. Absolutely ridiculous customer service. There are no answers to queries and it seems they couldn't care less once they have your money. I used to love ASOS but this has made me think very differently.Side note: I ordered a parcel on the 21st July and that one has arrived so who knows where the first one is!
"July 26, 2019",5,Everything is wonderful,It's beyond me why asos has so many bad reviews. I have only had GREAT experiences with them and they are truly my to-go webshop.
"July 25, 2019",1,Gone from bad to worse.,"Ordered last year, a week in advance for some items to arrive for a festival- they came 8 days later, one day too late. Then I bought something with the 'next day delivery' for a year, it came at about 9 pm but it was the next day at least. When I tried to order again with my 'one-year unlimited next day delivery' I was told I'd just purchased a one-off, despite the unlimited and one-off deliveries being the same price (¬£7.99). Thought it was a bit of a scam, never really had that issue with other companies before and wouldn't have paid ¬£7.99 for one-off next day because I didn't need it urgently. Left it about 10 months before I purchased from them again, ordered some boots expected to be here today. Ordered Monday. Need them by Saturday, was told to wait until 11.59pm to contact them again, to be told they're having issues with the courier. If they told me that earlier I would have ordered the boots again, with next day delivery. Now I don't have that option, I've come to vent my opinion. Been told to wait until the 5th of August!!Their shipping has gone way downhill and I don't think I will ever be purchasing again. Deleting the app and saving myself the hassle. Wish I'd never bothered. I very rarely leave bad feedback and I understand companies make mistakes but three times now in less than a year when I've only made 3 orders? I understand it may be the courier's fault (Hermes) but don't mislead your customers by saying their items will be here on a certain day and not following through with that. The 5th of August is 2 weeks from my order date, plus I never got a shipping email, only an order confirmation. I used to always order from ASOS, they were my go-to. But now I don't honestly think I'll use them again. Disappointed and annoyed. Such a shame to see a once good company just ruin themselves, and judging by the number of bad reviews, I'm not the only one who thinks so."
"July 25, 2019",1,Absolutely awful experience,"Absolutely awful experience - ordered click and collect, it said it was ready to collect but asda had no record. Went back three times and spent literally 3 hours on customer service chat (as they have no phone number) to sort it out - only got refunded 3 weeks later! Will never use again"
"July 25, 2019",1,Do not buy from them,Do not buy from them. If you return items they will keep money and items. I lost 200dlls. They have no live customer service so you will be stuck with online automated responses. Scam scam scam.

Irresponsible company
"July 25, 2019",3,Asos Review,"I‚Äôve been shopping online with Asos for a little over two years. When they first came out with the 2-day shipping for $20 a year, it was great! However. As of late 2018 they started declining. Now I don‚Äôt get my shipments for at least 4-5 days. Which isn‚Äôt horrible, just not what I originally paid for. On a more positive note, the clothes do arrive neatly packaged and the return process is fairly easy. Video reviews and pictures of items on my IG page @TiffTheStiff"
"July 25, 2019",1,Horrible customer service,"Horrible customer service! They said parcel was attempted to be delivered 3 times! That‚Äôs a lie! Website says they will leave a note after 1 time. Lie! After second time? Lie! No one left any notes. Tried to call customer service...they can‚Äôt do anything, not even give discount for the same order if I will order next time. For a refund I have to wait for a week! I mean there is nothing good I can say about ASOS."
"July 25, 2019",1,Zero stars if I could because my‚Ä¶,"Zero stars if I could because my package didn't event arrive. Ordered a maternity special occasion dress. Even with over a month shipping window, it did not arrive on time. Rep advise to wait for another month and then contact them again if it doesn't arrive. No ability to track the package or provide a better solution than to wait. Obviously I will not need the dress is another month. My event will be over and it's a MATERNITY dress. I asked to escalate and rep said she can't. Proceeded to just close the chat window on me. Terrible customer service. Terrible fexiblity."
"July 25, 2019",1,Terrible sent me wrong sized items,Terrible sent me wrong sized items. Returned and reordered because was leaving for holiday soon and they emailed me two days later saying that size was out of stock. Shocking.
"July 25, 2019",1,Atrocious Customer Service and Outrageous Refunds Policy,I ordered and paid for a Levi jacket. Completely the  wrong item turned up (the only common feature was that it was a jacket) and the jacket I originally ordered has been showing as out of stock from an hour after I ordered it. Hence I have had to source from elsewhere. I query whether or not my item was ever in stock or if it was just a scam to get my payment. Having paid they are saying it will take up to three weeks to process my refund for an item they cannot supply!! When I tried to pursue this with customer services they hung up on me twice each time saying it was my responsibility to correct their error before they would refund me and there was nothing more they could do other than suspend my account if I didn't return the item. This involved a 12 mile round trip to the post office at my expense which they would not acknowledge was in any way their responsibility. First and last time I will use ASOS and their customer service is outrageously bad when their solution is not to offer anything but simply to hang up.
"July 25, 2019",1,"Asos delivery very poor, lately.","Asos delivery has been really bad lately, Had a chat with someone called Olivia about my order being delayed.. Very rude to begin with and she just ended the chat when I asked her to cancel my order."

Contacted customer service expecting to at least  be given a reason as to why my order keeps getting cancelled and all they can tell me is ‚Äú you‚Äôll receive an email in 24 hours‚Äù. Which of course never happened. Then they just end the chat. I would never ever recommend anybody to purchase anything from them

I wanted next day delivery on a new order in my size, in which they couldn‚Äôt give me, bearing in mind none of this was my fault and the Asos staff had caused this issue. All they said was that I should choose next day delivery myself when I re-order at my expense. I further asked if they could give me a discount/promo code, or money back that I spent on delivery to be compensated for, however they refused. Very unhappy with the help that I received from customer care, getting no help at all. Won‚Äôt be using again."

Contacted customer service which was honestly just not helpful and came off as rude. The agent ended up closing the chat on me without giving me any answers to why this happened or even saying he would try and find out. Barely got an apology either.

Easy to say that I am beyond impressed time and time again by this company.I am very thoroughly pleased and happy about the experiences I've had with this trustworthy company.

I‚Äôve messaged them on Twitter, live chatted to them and emailed them multiple times, and nobody is helping. I haven‚Äôt had an apology, nor is anybody bothered.

There is still no sign of my parcel and they‚Äôre not interested at all, they‚Äôve closed my case and aren‚Äôt investigating it further. Which means I paid ¬£5.95 to receive my order at the same rate that I could have had it for free, if not worse. They said this isnt unusual and that I was just unlucky.

Allegedly they attempted twice more, no card was left. I contacted ASOS to be told the parcel was being returned and to contact them if nothing heard within 7 working days,  meanwhile I could reorder .7 working days has now passed,  ASOS want me to wait another week and refuse to refund. Meanwhile they keep telling me delivery was attempted 3 times and I can reorder. They are admitting I don't have the goods,  but are now extending their 7 working day deadline to 12 working days, before they will consider a refund. Patronising staff refuse to address the questions and keep sending same email. Despite being legally obliged to supply the goods or refund the money they insist on doing neither. If you want your money stolen order away!"
"July 23, 2019",4,I love Asos and their clothes,"I love Asos and their clothes. The bad thing is their return policy with 28 days which is an odd and uneven number so it's hard to know the exact last day you have to return your clothes if you want your money back. There is no information on their website about it, other websites for example Zalando write which day you have to send back your order if you want your money back, but Asos doesn't have that service. I had to contact their customer service about this but it took weeks for them to reply, which is not ok! I eventually did send back clothes from the same order before the last return-date, but then recieved an email where Asos said that I returned the clothes too late - even though it was their customer service that told me that exact date! A bit confusing and strange, but they wrote in the email that they made an exception and will return my money this time. But this doesn't feel so safe for me as a customer.Also you have to print out your return labels. Seems a bit old, who owns a printer nowadays? I had to print out the labels from an internet shop for ‚Ç¨7, there goes the free return. I also spent hours looking for a place with printers. I really love the clothes <3 but Asos need to update their return policy and become more modern."

Spoke to Harry from ASOS on live chat told me I couldn‚Äôt return them obviously because I wore them, and that he‚Äôs ‚Äúsorry‚Äù and linked more gym clothes - like I‚Äôm going to buy more?!

I‚Äôm not sure what the problem is, but Yodel has a system saying that they had missed you, when they haven‚Äôt even attempt a delivery (no card left, no knocking on the door). I‚Äôve had ‚Äúmissing‚Äù parcels that completely disappear, something very fishy with them. Why should I waist my time searching for my parcel I‚Äôve paid for? ASOS has a responsibility to make sure that parcel gets to me, if they choose to work with the worst delivery company (probably coz they‚Äôre cheap) then I‚Äôll choose not to buy from them."

In 2019, the store had some changes in the quality of service and especially in the delivery method. Several times in a row I received completely different goods instead of those ordered and had to send them back. One order came back to the store without specifying any reasons. I am a member of a group of buyers in the Asos store, which exists on Facebook and read similar complaints every day. Why is the store management not taking action? Many have stopped shopping at this store."

"July 22, 2019",1,Dreadful customer service - be wary of discount offers,"If you use a discount code and have return an item from the order, you can ask for a replacement. However, if the replacement isn‚Äôt available at the time, they do nothing - so you lose the discount off the rest of the order. Then they make absolutely no effort to rectify this, effectively duping you into spending money that you wouldn‚Äôt have, if it wasn‚Äôt for the offer. Then you ask them for an alternative replacement and they refuse. And then, when you ask them to cancel your account, they refuse to (breaching data protection regulations) unless you opt out of marketing that you had no idea that you opted into in the first place. Dreadful customer service all round."
"July 22, 2019",1,Shocking...,"What an absolute s*** show. Two orders are missing, Hermes have confirmed they can not find them.

I will not be shopping here again!!"

The woman told me my order was processing and I would be told when it left their warehouse. She then went on to say I had to wait till the end of the day to see if my order arrived and she wouldn‚Äôt look into it any further. I said well my order clearly isn‚Äôt going to arrive today if it hasn‚Äôt even been dispatched yet. She then said sorry I can‚Äôt help you any further and SHE ended the live chat. Absolutely appalling customer service. It should be the customer that ends a live chat! Maybe it has something to do with the timer they have on the top of their live chats. They clearly have a limit on how long they‚Äôre prepared to deal with you! There was no reason why she couldn‚Äôt look into why my order was delayed, she just wouldn‚Äôt go against policy of making me wait till after the estimated arrival date. So now I‚Äôm completely lost as to where my order is and I have to waste more of my time tomorrow."
"July 22, 2019",1,Theft from ASOS!,"Looks like I am not the only one who was scammed by ASOS! I placed an order for 6 dressed and used a promotion code. I kept all but one dress which did not fit. After about two weeks, I reached out to the company to understand what the status was on my return and they informed me that because I used a promo code I needed to meet a $250 spending minimum in order to receive a refund. Because my order did not reach this minimum they refused to refund, credit or even return the dress to me. I have askedseveral times for them to return the dress, to which they have told me they cannot do and I would need to repurchaseonline. They refuse to let me speak with a manager, lack any empathy and have no phone number to call. The online chat support even disconnected our chat. Will never buy from them again!"

Later on my order finally goes through and I receive my order the following week. Unfortunately it‚Äôs not at all what I ordered and I have to return the wrong order to ASOS. I have to wait another 14 days to get the thing I actually ordered. I have made ASOS aware in a message regarding the order, that I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs optimal service and they just ignored the comment. Bad service!"

When I tried to do so, my paypal account did not work and in order for it to work, they needed some documents that I do not currently possess therefore it could take a while for my account to be fully activated. I informed asos about it and asked for a different way to pay for the return. Not only they were rude, as in it was not their issue that my paypal account did not work, they were also not helpful at all. So now I have to keep stuff that I did not order, so I will probably donate them. I at least expected that they would care, since it was their fault (incorrect items) not mine. I used to be a fan of asos, I'll definitely not order from it never ever again."

ASOS used to be great, and I recommended them to everybody I knew as they were so easy to use. However for the past year, they have made lots of mistakes and their Customer Services are shocking. They are rude and just use generic robotic responses (they could quite well be robots). They don't keep you updated when you have a query they just leave you wondering what is happening whilst you do not have your money or your items.I am still astonished how you managed to pack 3 items out of the 14 within the order and send it without including any paperwork or anything else. How did you go so wrong? Unfortunately I will never be using ASOS again once this gets resolved (if it ever does)."

Unfortunately, it still hasn‚Äôt been delivered, and today is the 21th of July! Which means it is belayed 6 days. I've been in contact with your costumer service by mail the past 6 days, but unfortunately it hasn't helped much. It seems that you still haven't sent my order, hence the costumer service mostly send me a standard reply of me receiving an email when the order has been sent. At the same time, you ask me to check with my neighbours and post office to see if the order has been delivered there which makes no sense since you later in the mail tell me that the parcel hasn't been packed yet. I haven't got a confirmation nor, nor a tracking number but the money has been withdrawn from my account on the 17th of July! ‚Ä®I think this is outrageous and I would like to get in contact with somebody that doesn't just send me a standard reply. And I really, really think that a compensation is in it's right place for this very, very bad experience. I don't is is ok to treat your costumers this badly. If needed I can provide you a screen shot of all the mail correspondence. ‚Ä®And yes I‚Äôve been to the post office and asked my neighbours which is extremely embarrassing that I have to spend MY time on a service I have payed for."

I contacted customer service and they said there is nothing they can do and I have to wait 7+10days (for the order to get back to warehouse and for the refund to be processed). I told them I just want the product and surely they can just reorder as it is not my fault that the delivery company did not leave any information slip for me to rearrange,but in the end I am the only person,who is paying the price so to speak, and they said that they can only go by the information from the delivery provider and cannot do anything more. I asked to log a complaint and the guy said that they do not have a complaint logging system, which is even crazier.

The shorts I needed urgently before a holiday so opted for ¬£6 one day delivery, I would not have bought the socks had I not been buying the shorts. They arrived and were outrageously large on me, having measured the waist they were 37‚Äù and labelled as 34‚Äù. Although the shorts can be refunded I didn‚Äôt think unfair to also ask for the delivery to be refunded as to me this is a faulty item, the customer service representatives disagreed and refuse to do anything. It is also wrong that they do not have a review system in place so that people can be warned of this earlier. To me this is completely unfair and shouldn‚Äôt be done by large companies exploiting high delivery costs to make a profit."
"July 19, 2019",1,Terrible customer service,"I've had a dreadful experience with asos over the past couple of weeks. After expecting my order to arrive 1 week after placing the order, I was advised it would not be arriving for at least another 10 days. When tracking the order today, I then see that Hermes claimed to have attempted 3 deliveries and we're now sending my order back. This was untrue and no attempted delivery cards have been left. I took my complaint to asos ""chat now"" and was told by Paige that there was nothing they could do and I'd receive a refund in 7 days. No apology and no sympathy. Terrible customer service."

A little customer service would be nice, reimbursing some of my $ by refunding another item would have been nice...no such luck!

"July 19, 2019",1,Asos is weak,"Asos offers free returns so of course I found that helpful when shopping on their site for the first time for a jumpsuit. I ordered several different designs in several sizes since I didn‚Äôt know what my size would be in their clothing. Their business model seemed to be online only sales woth no brick and mortar so it made sense to me that they‚Äôd offer free returns. It was a large order and ultimately nothing fit except for ONE. I was hoping to keep 2-3 designs to have for different occasions. I made a second order to try different styles. They also didn‚Äôt fit and because they were sale items, the stock was low and I couldn‚Äôt order different sizes. So I decided to return both orders (value $400) and kept the one jumpsuit. I prepared them to mail using the labels that ASOS sent with the order. And I dropped them in the UPS secured pickup box in my building. One made it and was processed a few days later. The second and bigger one still isn‚Äôt made it and I‚Äôve reached out several times by chat and email to Asos about this. They‚Äôre telling me they haven‚Äôt received it yet and need proof of postage. Well because I used the labels they sent, I don‚Äôt have proof of postage. It‚Äôs over $300 that I‚Äôve lost and I‚Äôm real mad. I can‚Äôt believe they don‚Äôt have a call center because chat and email don‚Äôt suffice to problem solve- that must be done in person. Instead they just send me their canned responses. They also wouldn‚Äôt transfer me to a supervisor. I‚Äôve NEVER had problems with other retailers like this- amazon, Wayfair, Pact, Gap, etc- they don‚Äôt ask for proof of postage and my returns have always been refunded. As well, the ‚Äúproof of postage‚Äù language is not on the materials in the packaging that Asos includes so I followed the rules and now they‚Äôre telling me I‚Äôm wrong. They have ‚Äúpolicies‚Äù that I have to follow but apparently my own policies don‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôve asked them for proof they haven't received it but they disregard that. It‚Äôs crap. Plus the clothing is low quality so don‚Äôt even bother."

The customer care people on facebook were quick to respond but it's really annoying when a different person deals with you every time and it's clearly a stock message. It wasn't my fault that the package was lost and you still held my ¬£50 for 3 weeks until you were able to process is. Surely that's not on? Overall I use ASOS regularly but this was handled poorly

When i checked the tracking again, it said they had requested it to be sent back to them. AND THEN the parcel had been recieved by my local depot! I phoned both DPD and ASOS who both told me nothing could be done. Dpd said that asos had to cancel the request and it could then be delivered to us today. After one phone call, a few emails and a online chat, I was told that they ""cant do anything"" and to wait 7 days for a refund before ordering again.. which is a complete joke, what happened to the investiagtion that was suppose to happen to see if it was being delivered? And what is with the automated chat and emails? Try talking to them to resovle issues and all you get is copy and pasted nonesense that has nothing to do with what you are saying! Put off majorly. Need to sort the customer service out asap"
"July 19, 2019",1,What happened to the ASOS I knew?!,"I have been a loyal customer to ASOS and always stood by the products and delivery. I ordered a parcel which never came and customer service told me to keep waiting 4 days after the expected delivery date , then they eventually gave me a refund when I never asked for one. This NEVER happened before. Not sure what happened to the amazing ASOS?! I wont be shopping there anymore as much as I want to."
"July 19, 2019",1,Disgraceful Customer Service and Don‚Äôt fulfil on promise!,Absolutely disgraceful customer service with ASOS placed an order for shoes with expensive next day delivery as needed for younger brother big prom day. And the parcel has been returned to ASOS from the parcel delivering company. Then I went on webchat to ASOS and they‚Äôre not willing to go extra mile to sort it out. Instead they said wait 7 days till they get the package then refund 10 working days. So extremely bad service and well done ASOS because that‚Äôs one shop I can never go back to again.

I would NOT reccomend ASOS to anyone."
"July 19, 2019",1,Item from ASOS NEVER ARRIVE!!,"I had 2 separate orders. One arrived, the other never arrived! Customer service is abhorrent to say the least! Nonchalant and indifferent! Totally unprofessional!They seriously need to have an entire management and staffs overhaul! Such disgusting and obnoxious service attitude! And what‚Äôs with the bloody delivery problems? Why can‚Äôt they deliver properly and efficiently like everyone else?!??"
"July 19, 2019",1,Such bad customer service,Such bad customer service. I ordered an item to be delivered for a certain occasion. I paid extra for express delivery only to be told it was going to take 11 days for delivery! If you need a dress for an upcoming event do not order off this site. Unless you're willing to wait over 2 weeks. Or even 3.
"July 19, 2019",1,I wish i could give zero stars!,I wish i could give zero stars!They claimed they have tried to deliver my order which they haven‚Äôt! Tried to speak to them the guy ended the chat!Never ever buying from them again! Worst service ever!

"July 18, 2019",1,Absolutely shocking customer service,"Absolutely shocking customer service. I waited 2 months for my refund to finally 'turn up', after worrying about having to pay ¬£200 for items I didn't even have. I continually got scripted responses from any ""customer service"" representatives, that were patronising and incredibly unhelpful. Something dodgy is going on with ASOS, as this is the first time I have ever experienced anything like this. Sort it out ASOS."
"July 18, 2019",1,They are a joke,They are a joke. Some of the worst customer service imaginable. I will never order from them again. Lied to me throughout.
"July 17, 2019",1,Worst customer service.,"Worst customer service.Ordered shoes for an event with next day delivery, the DPD delivery driver called Marlon didn't bother coming at my door while I was in waiting patiently for the scheduled delivery, next thing I received an email confirming that the parcel was delivered and signed by someone else whereas no first attempt was made and I repeat I was in. Upon calling customer services and complaining about the fact that I needed it resolved ASAP because I was going to a work event and the shoes where in that parcel, an agent called Gilly with the worst attitude told me that they won't do anything about it and that it was okay according to terms and conditions if the driver doesn't deliver to the customer but make the decision to leave the parcel in what he believes is a ""safe place"". What is the point to take people's address and stop drop the parcel elsewhere!!! Basically, they support lazinessof the driver but we pay for next day delivery then we have to locate the parcel ourselves while they are happy to charge you without fulfilling the deal. Absolutely disgusting way of treating the customer. On top of that, she was very condescending, dismissive and literally paused the conversation then asked me what was my question again? Nobody is willing to help and instead they repeat the same thing and end the conversation with """"we can't do anything about it, anything else I can help you with?"" If this is trained customer care, this is a joke. No solution was issued and I had to cancel a prepaid event attendance. WELL DONE ASOS. WHAT A GOOD JOB!!!!!"
"July 17, 2019",1,"Used to be fab, what the heck happened?","Had a terrible experience with ASOS customer service over the past two weeks.They shipped my order through YODEL, an equally incompetent company (look at their Trustpilot site to see how bad they are at doing their job of delivering parcels!).Yodel claimed to have attempted delivery 4 times (while I was at home), to then claim they lost my parcel. Asos decided to send me a replacement order (but couldn't confirm they would ship with a different courier... great.), however the most important item I had bought was now out of stock.I tried time and time again to speak to a human at customer services, but kept getting the same robotic email responses, with nobody clearly reading my query or bothering to answer the actual question I had. Several of the email ""responses"" I received from their ""customer service"" people were not at all related to my question. Do not use ASOS unless you want your parcels stolen by Yodel drivers and then to deal with an endless amount of basically talking to a wall when trying to contact ASOS customer service :)"

"July 17, 2019",1,What‚Äôs happened ASOS!,"What‚Äôs happened ASOS!I use to shop with no problems! But now had two issues in a row and customer care were useless. First the item was missing, then the replacement they sent was completely the wrong item. Now I have to wait to return it and they advised they would send me the correct item if it‚Äôs in stock, or I could have a refund! I just want the correct item in the expected time frame. In summary, I‚Äôm out of pocket and I don‚Äôt have the item. Not impressed!"
"July 17, 2019",1,very poor shipping estimates,very poor shipping estimates. I waited three weeks and they ended up canceling my order. They used to be really good. Now I'm not sure I'll ever order again.
"July 17, 2019",2,Very bad customer service,Ryan from the online customer service was very rude and didn‚Äôt help at all with my problem. He ended the chat even though I still had many unanswered questions. The only reason I give 2 stars and not 1 is because I were able to contact ASOS. ASOS should do a better job training their employees.
"July 17, 2019",1,I had so much trouble with my order..,"I had so much trouble with my order... After their website clearly had a bug (tested after), it was delivered to my old address, despite me changing it a few times while selecting a delivery option. After contacting customer services, they couldn't help and were copying and pasting the same information I could find on the website, and not even answering my questions.. I felt like talking to a wall..After that, I had to return two of the garments from the order, and it has been 7 working days haven't heard about the refund and every time contacting customer services, they tell me to wait and give until the end of the day. Also, it takes 40 minutes to get a reply to 3 questions on the live chat. One of the worst customer services ever."

I was so scared that they going to send me the wrong stuff or that would be a problem with shipping BUT EVERYTHING WAS PURFECT! It came at the right time that they said iz would come and it came what i ordered! Im really happy and would order again. No problems here!
"July 17, 2019",4,Will shop again,Got back to me within a day or so. They processed my exchange and was helpful with sizing!Thanks again!
"July 17, 2019",1,Scam,One item from my order was missing and one was wrong. I have returned the additional item but I have never received the missing one that I paid for. Their appalling customer service always has an excuse with no solution. Noone replies to my emails. I have no choice than open a dispute against them at my bank.
"July 17, 2019",1,ASOS is a scam!! ASOS is modern day ROBBERY!!,"ASOS is a scam....please do not order anything on that ROBBERY site called ASOS. For almost 3 months now, my Order wasn't delivered, no refund, no communication from them. When you do contact them, the reply is totally APPALLING!!!... ASOS is SCAM!!!!!!! ASOS is ROBBERY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"July 17, 2019",1,"No clothing and no money, robbed by asos","I ordered some clothing for a month long vacation I am going on in a week, and I ordered it with expedited 2 day shipping just to be sure it will get here in time. On the day it was supposed to arrive i checked the tracking number and it said the package was being held by Fedex. So I called fedex and they said the package was found to be empty and they will not deliver the empty package to me and that I need to contact ASOS. So I contacted ASOS customer support and they said that they will investigate for the next 10 days, then they will make a decision. I explained to them that I ordered with expedited 2 day shipping and I need a fund because I will be leaving the country this week and will not be here nor will I need the clothing once I am gone. They will not give me a refund even though I will not receive my package. So now I am stuck with no clothes and no money. I have to pay my credit card off and they refuse to refund me for the missing or stolen package, even though fedex officially confirms the package  is empty. Asos refuses to refund me! Horrible customer care, they straight out rob you of your money and don‚Äôt get you your clothing."
"July 16, 2019",1,I would feel ashamed if I were Asos,"Such a big and popular website, but the customer service is THE WORST I have ever seenIn my life. They should fire anyone who is resonsible for this pathetic service. I haven't received a confirmation email regarding my order and I emailed them and send a message through facebook. They don't respond. I have had a problem with asos before but the service has gotten worse."
"July 16, 2019",1,Horrible costumer service,"I ordered five pairs of shoes from them, and they sent the shoes to the wrong address. When my shoes went missing I contacted them regarding my order and they said they would send me a replacement. A day later someone showed up from two houses down my block saying they had some packages that they thought belonged to me. So I contacted ASOS saying that the original order was found. Then they said that I had to return my original order and that there would be a new order to replace every shoe. Unfortunately the new order only consisted of one pair as the other shoes were out of stock(which was not mentioned by any of the five agents I talked to). So now I have to return almost everything I bought, when I could just keep my order and send the new shoe that came back to them. I would rank them lower than one star but it would not let me."
"July 16, 2019",1,Terrible shipping practices,"Terrible shipping practices.You're lucky if your package even makes it to you at all, but be prepared for extremely long shipping times, often overdue from expected delivery dates."
"July 16, 2019",1,Worst online shop ever!,Worst online shop ever! It took me a month to say it's out of stock and to refund it. I totally DON'T recommend!!! The customers are really bad and don't care about you. They also lie and look like robots talking to you.
"July 16, 2019",1,Hopeless customer service,"Hopeless customer service. Ordered an item, a month after constantly asking for any feedback as I did not receive my item the specialist team took over 2 weeks to send a reply and was then informed that the item is out of stock. All i got was a refund for my item. Hopeless service"
"July 16, 2019",5,Parfait,"J'ai command√© plusieurs fois sur Asos, je n'ai eu aucun probl√®me et je n'ai effectu√© aucun retour ! Je recommande. I have ordered a lot of time on Asos. I haven't get any problem ! I made any return because all of my order was alright."
"July 16, 2019",1,Worst experience ever!!,"Worst experience ever!!! The system made a mistake on my delivery mail address. I contacted the costumer services and the said they can't do anything, just wait if the package is returned by the wrong delivery mail address, at that moment they would issued a refund.Who know if the item would be return (i highly doubt it)... and that wasn't my mistake, it was ASOS mistake!  Basically I just lost my money and they don't really care.Worst online shopping experience! would never buy anything again from this site. if you have and issue on they part they don't do anything to fix it."
"July 16, 2019",5,Absolutely love asos,"Absolutely love asos. Been buying for years and years and never ever had a problem (ever). Would love for them to reintroduce the rewardscheme but aside from that I have no complaints.Service, range and website and all significantly better than it's competitors."
"July 16, 2019",1,Horrible Customer Service,"Ordered clothing and was pleased the website offering a discount code to new customers. Used the code but it didn‚Äôt work - the order however posted without the discount applied. Contacted to ask for the discount to be applied retroactively. After going back and forth with 3 different reps (the first saying she would help as soon as the order appeared in the system, the second claiming the code was wrong -despite the website displaying a banner telling me to enter it, and the third saying the code was for a different country only and the applicable discount in the U.K. had expired so I was out of luck but should ‚Äúlook for another code for future purchases.‚Äù) ASOS is unwilling to make good on their offer. After coming here and seeing the dreadful reviews I regret not looking them up before purchasing. Will not be purchasing again."
"July 16, 2019",1,NEVER EVER AGAIN,"I stopped using Asos because of the awful customer service months ago but was looking for some sandals and they were the only one that have ones that i liked so decided to try again..... NEVER AGAIN! Made an order the 17th on june and got it the 19th, return it asking for an exchange the 23rd of june. Today is 17th of july and still no news so I contacted them, they said they were really sorry and sent the correct item back to me, but they chose an address that is not the one from the original order, when I told them they said I can try and get the parcel for the old address (where I don't live) or if whoever lives there now send them back to them I will get a refund. So, USELESS AND INCOMPETENT..... and I will not get my shoes anyway"
"July 16, 2019",5,The best!!,"The best. I love Asos. So much to choose from, orders are always correct. Returns are extremely easy. Their tall range is always long enough, unlike some retailers."
"July 16, 2019",1,0 STARS - NEVER BUY from Asos,"I deeply regret ever buying from asos because this website is absolute rubbish. The amount of headaches buying from them has given me is crazy but now i‚Äôve finally learned my lesson and i will never buy from them again. And i do not recommend anyone to go to buy from their rubbish shop. I‚Äôve seen many bad reviews lately and i can completely understand, because their service is absolute rubbish, their customerservice doesn‚Äôt do anything and they will take your money in a second, but when it comes to refunds and damage compensation they will take forever or they won‚Äôt even get back to it at all. This has been going on for too long now and i‚Äôve tried many times to reach out to customer service with regards to next day delivery, i ordered two times and both times it wasn‚Äôt delivered the next day and it took a couple of days which is bad service, you don‚Äôt even get what you pay for. So for anyone reading, don‚Äôt even bother paying for next day delivery cause you won‚Äôt even get it the next day and they‚Äôll say they can‚Äôt do anything for you. And when you speak to one of the workers they always give you the same, arrogant, generic answers. It‚Äôs been over a month that I returned things i bought from asos and i still haven‚Äôt received a refund, not even an email or anything. I want my damn money back and a compensation for all the headache and wasted time and wasted effort with horrible customer service they gave me."

"July 15, 2019",1,Poor service,"I've paid for next day delivery all year round, but my item didn't arrive. Two days after I was told it could take up to 5 days to arrive. This is the second time that this has happened, which is appalling considering I've paid extra just for next day delivery."

"July 15, 2019",1,"no deliver, sh**** support, no refund, sh**** asos","I paid extra money for fast deliver, but didn't receive package right on time. Didn't get any tracking number, nothing. Everyday writting to them for a shipping refund, they always writting the same message but just different day ""If you haven't received your parcel after today - 15th July has passed, please get back in touch and we can look into this further for you"". First and the last time buying from them. P.S didn't receive my package, no refunded money, nothing. Most Sh**** experience on E-commerce."
"July 15, 2019",1,Don't ever buy from Asos.,"Don't ever buy from Asos.. they don't deliver your package in time and they don't care about it. These reviews demonstrate that their customers are not important for them. Moreover, their customer service chat is a waste of time. They treat you like a fool and you will get really mad."
"July 15, 2019",5,very reliable store,"perfect products (that's because I order the best ones) and very good service. I use them for more than 5 years now and they've never failed my expectations. couple of times the untracked shipments were missing and once a wrong item was sent, but all was immediately refunded/replaced, including return postages. standard delivery handling takes now more time than it used to, but since I trust them 100%, I just wait and everything is always okay"

"July 14, 2019",1,Appaling customer service and NO TRACKING,"Item did not arrive on delivery date, checked with customer service who were really rude and unhelpful. They give you a tracking number , but then tell you they aren't able to track the item because there is no tracking number. Then asked me to check with my local postal office. How am I supposed to check if there is no tracking number? Don't order from here"
"July 14, 2019",1,Awful. Avoid if item is available elsewhere,"Awful. V. rare that the next-day delivery option works - when the parcel is inexplicably delayed you are told to wait a further 5 days, before it's investigated. The agreement with Hermes does not allow ASOS to contact them, so all the Customer Services team can do is read the same tracking information that you have access to. Will not refund delivery charge or reissue orders that go missing. Separately we've received items that have clearly been used or left screwed up in a corner (had to return an expensive blazer because even ironing couldn't save it from the state it turned up). Also, issues where the delivery has gone wrong at the ASOS warehouse (hasn't even made it to Hermes!) and they've still refused to investigate / claimed they can't contact the warehouse and have made out like it's nothing to do with them...In short: wherever possible AVOID"
"July 13, 2019",1,Terrible place to shop- choose any other site but ASOS,Terrible place to shop. They have terrible UX and a faulty process for users to troubleshoot. Making users jump through hoops to even get in contact. I used to place $200 monthly orders and learned my lesson. Do not shop with this company that lacks customer service and an understanding of basic business.
"July 13, 2019",1,Absolutely disgraceful service.,Absolutely disgraceful service.My wife to be ordered bridesmaids dresses from these insensitive organisation.In accordance with ASOS returns policy and proof of posting they downright refused to refund and closed her account and just wouldn‚Äôt listen!Organising a wedding is stressful and costly enough and these nasty people have ¬£500 pounds of our money.I‚Äôve never experienced such appalling customer service and firms like this will make consumers return to the high street. When you return via Royal Mail with proof of posting and ASOS call you a liar basically it‚Äôs outrageous. ASOS need to take it up with their chosen courier service if they state goods haven‚Äôt been received NOT tell you to seek a refund from your credit card provider.We wish we had read the other shocking stories on here before using this company. Like others go elsewhere and avoid this company.
"July 13, 2019",1,Very rude customer chat.,Very rude customer chat.I asked all questions politely and was then told they can‚Äôt help me and they ended the chat.This was an issue from them sending me a faulty item that had already been tried to be fixed by another user.

I would highly advise avoiding this company at all cost. If you haven't noticed, they don't even address any of the comments on this site. It should show you, they don't care about their customers at all."
"July 13, 2019",1,Do something about your customer service reps please Asos,"Awful Awful Customer Service. They‚Äôd sent a tagless, clearly worn dress, which I‚Äôm after as it‚Äôs the right fit/colour etc (it went out of stock when I bought it- must‚Äôve been the last one, so an exchange was not an option unfortunately- but said I was happy to exchange it if she knew of any UNWORN ones floating about)Explained all this and said that I‚Äôm also happy to keep it if they could give me a discount- didn‚Äôt acknowledge anything I‚Äôd written other than it was tagless - she said sorry it was tagless and to use the delivery note to return it. No s¬£@t Sherlock. It makes no difference clearly to this company if you‚Äôve been a regular good  customer- Maddison her name was, didn‚Äôt have the courtesy to even bother telling me whether it‚Äôs policy or not to offer discount on faulty/used items. She cut off the chat before I even got a chance to ask."
"July 13, 2019",2,Threatened to return wrong item received!,"I ordered a black cardigan and received the same one in navy blue.. OK, I said to myself, mistakes happen and as I liked it, even though it was the wrong item, I decided to keep it. Now, MY mistake was that I decided to let ASOS know of the mistake THEY had made..And then I chatted with Jerome..Jerome, almost like a nice little robot, simply quoted policy to me and insisted that I should return the item for a refund. After stating, multiple times, that i simply contacted them to inform them of this, when i simply could have let this go, I was told that if I didn't proceed with the return I might have ""problems"" in future returns!!!!For real ASOS!?! I am wasting my time to let you know you f'ed up somewhere in the process, I am willing to waste more time to send you pictures so that YOU can fix YOUR mistakes and you are threatening me??? Awesome policy and customer service.."

I ordered product to Canada to arrive on or before July 8, and still have not received my product. They did not provide tracking for my order - which is shocking in our day and age of tracking product internationally. I was first advised it was a technical delay, then a technical glitches, then told to wait longer for no reason. They did not answer my questions and kept saying to wait until August 3 (an arbitrary date?) to receive my package although I am meant to receive it NO LATER then July 8. This is legitimately a scam and now I am out $300. I will be reporting this."

Second order was for 3 items; two were wrong items, one was correct item but different size from what ordered. (2 orders all 5 items wrong....really??) More than 10 emails send, never any reply. Send the items back....never any refund. How can this be one of the biggest online clothing stores in Europe??Stay away from ASOS. It is the absolute worst. Can I give ratings under Zero please!!!!!"

I ordered a product that never arrived even though I received a delivery slip in my mailbox saying that the product was to be collected at the collection point (a shop nearby). I Went to the shop, no pack to be found. 3 years ago when I bought an item with ASOS,  they sent me the wrong item. So I had to reorder it a second time. This is the second and last time for me to buy anything with them: I am done with ASOS.It seems like this is a tradition by ASOS to be so confused.I highly recommend you to AVOID them"
"July 12, 2019",1,Do NOT order from ASOS - no longer reliable,"This review is a warning to all ASOS customers.I have ordered from ASOS for many years, but lately it has turned upside down into the worst experience ever.1) ASOS did not deliver my order.2) ASOS did not warn me about any delivery delays.3) ASOS lied and provided me false tracking number claiming that they have dispatched the order (the tracking No. provided no results).4) ASOS informed me about a one-day-delay in the delivery.5) ASOS finally informed me that my order is cancelled and that I will receive a refund in 5-10 days (after checking my account I see that the order has NOT been cancelled).I placed my order on 28th of June. I haven't had the chance to actually speak to a human being.

I have been a customer of ASOS for years but since they have started using Gnewt, the deliveries are an absolute joke, I have just had TWO orders returned to ASOS because the driver was unable to deliver (even though there was somebody in my house) ASOS are not interested in helping, i have had around 50 emails back and forth, online chats, phonecalls, and nobody will actually deal with this issue. I had paid for premium delivery for two orders that i have never received. I will NEVER shop with ASOS again and know many other people who have said the same thing."
"July 12, 2019",1,THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER,"THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! I have ordered my stuff more then 1,5 month ago and they keep telling me to wait and only then they will investigate! After me inquiring about my packages, all they did is copied the exact same message that they sent to me a month ago. I cannot believe that! I don‚Äôt know who work in their customer service department but clearly those people don‚Äôt give a single ‚Äúf‚Äù about any of the customers. I guess the manager and owners are the same since they allow all of this to happen. GET YOU S*** TOGETHER AND ADMIT WHEN YOU SCREW UP!"
"July 12, 2019",1,The worst online company for a refund,"The worst online company for a refund! Such a joke so slow and takes weeks!! Always having to chance it up. I have ordered from other companys pretty little thing, miss guided and there system is so fast!!"
"July 12, 2019",1,Terrible service,"Customer service is the worst.I made a purchase that should have been delivered within 5 business days, for which I was charged immediately. When the order didn't arrive, customer service would not give me any answers and just told me to wait.Twelve days after my purchase I was informed that the items I ordered were not in stock (though they available were when I ordered them) so I would get a refund within the next 10 working days. Basically, they take your money for about a month, and you get nothing in return."
"July 12, 2019",1,Seriously gone downhill so many issues:,"Seriously gone downhill so many issues:- Ordered shoes and been sent tights. Is no one checking what‚Äôs being sent out?- Use of terrible couriers, so despite paying for the annual next day delivery it‚Äôs not guaranteed - Foundation being received with no hygiene seal...OR LID!By far the worst thing is their returns process. I tend to put all my items into one package and somehow I only get refunded for ONE ITEM. It then takes weeks/months of chasing to get the rest of your money. Clearly ASOS weren‚Äôt prepared for the growth they‚Äôve had. A company of their size should have clear, defined processes that work. They should have proper customer service with people you can actually talk to over the phone, why is social media the only way of contacting them. They care about the reputation on social media but they don‚Äôt actually care about the customers who give them their hard earned money. Sort it out!"
"July 11, 2019",1,Worst customer service ever - package missing,"Just awful. Wish I could give 0 stars. I bought a dress on June 13th to wear for my engagement party on August 4th. The dress was to supposed to arrive July 9th and it is no where to be seen. The tracking information has not updated since it left the warehouse. I contacted them numerous times and each time they tell me I have to wait until a different date before they can do anything - July 29th, July 31st, August 2nd, August 6th. I explained my party is on August 4th and I need my dress but they don't care. I asked them to send a replacement dress and they refused to do anything because they ""have to follow certain processes"". It's absolutely absurd. I will now have to look for a new dress elsewhere with almost no time left thanks to ASOS. Never ever purchasing from them again. I just wish I'd read the reviews before making my purchase."
"July 11, 2019",1,Everyone is right - it's the worst,Everyone is right. This is the worst. Took 5 weeks to receive my parcel (in Canada) and TWO of the 4 items are wrong. I can't return them because I have to pay more for shipping the return than it's worth. This is laughably f***ed. I've learned my lesson to not ever order from ASOS again.
"July 11, 2019",1,Scam Artists,"They sent me the wrong item, told me to send it back and wait 45 days for a refund...what kind of customer service is that? They messed up my order yet I have to wait for them to refund my money and no option of even trying to fix the fact that they sent me the incorrect item. That‚Äôs like going to the grocery store buying a pint of ice cream and getting home and finding out it‚Äôs mashed potatoes, so you call them (although ASOS don‚Äôt do phones) and tell them ‚Äúhey I paid for ice cream‚Äù and they say ‚Äújust come all the way back to the store and we‚Äôll mail you a check in 45 days or when we feel like it and hopefully the ice cream you paid for originally will still be there for you to purchase all over again, and hopefully it‚Äôs not mashed potatoes again‚Äù I feel like good customer service is when a company treats you the way they wanna be treated. ASOS isn‚Äôt a good company they have all the signs of ways to get out of actually treating their  customers with respect."

"July 11, 2019",1,Awful delivery and customer care,Asos has a great selection of clothing but the customer service is awful. I always choose the next day delivery yet the delivery is always late. The return take an eternity and no body is there to answer you wether they got the item or not and tell you when you‚Äôre going to take your money back !!! Overall I don‚Äôt recommend.

"July 11, 2019",1,Simply awful service.,"Simply awful service.I have to give one star, but I wouldn't even want to give them one star.I have complained about my missing package and I cant get a straight answer from the company. First I was told to wait until after the 4th of July, when I then contact them again on the 5th of July, I'm being told to wait until after the 9th of July. Then i follow up on the 10th and I'm told to wait until the 16th, because all the multiple other advisers I spoke to before (which are at this point 5 plus advisers) have all given me incorrect information. I have requested a refund multiple times but I am told their hands are tied until after the 4th, after the 9th and now after the 16th. I have STILL not received my refund and they are refusing to act until after the 16th were I expect I will be told to wait until after probably the 20th or something. This is a total scam!Not only are they not able to advise me, most of the advisers I spoke to were rude and passive aggressive. The reason I have had to go through so many advisers is that they keep closing the chat on me and changing adviser.I would advise everyone not to use ASOS. I am myself prepared to launch an official complaint."

They now estimate the delivery somewhere between July 18-25. However, they refuse to change shipping address despite the fact that I ordered the products to our summer house, but will end my vacation and go home after July 16.It's a disaster, because I won't get my products and also because I won't get my money back until 4-6 weeks after the delivery (the package stays 2 weeks at the post office, then adding 2-4 weeks repayment time). Which is nearly two months from now. The products are sold out so I can't re-order them. Also, worst customer service ever."
"July 11, 2019",1,Could not be worse their practices are illegal.,"Could not be worse. Stealing money for taxes that are not due, then cancelling the orders and never returning the tax. Robot customer service staff tell you they have no power to do anything other than send you to faq pages on their site. Then they disconnect chat and/ or stop replying to emails."
"July 11, 2019",1,Rip off delivery fees,Terrible customer service and rip off delivery. I made an order on Friday for next day delivery which cost me ¬£5.99. Item not delivered until Monday. I made a complaint due to next day delivery not being met even though I had paid extra for this. ASOS said they cant guarantee it and never refunded me. Basically told me tough luck. Other companies have always refunded me if they dould not meet the next day delivery time. ASOS you have lost a customer through your rip off fees and bad attitude to your customers

On asking ASOS for the delivery cost to be refunded also they refused and told me that as my parcel had arrived on time, despite being faulty so the delivery costs were still payable! After many emails back and forth I requested this issue to be escalated to a manager and was told that there weren't any ! I am now going to contact CAB about this. I've never heard of such a thing. I asked for them to email  the small print on this and they ignored my many times of asking.I think it's very poor of them and they did not value my custom what so ever"

"July 10, 2019",1,TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Seems I'm not the only one furious with ASOS customer service. I love them as a place to buy from and have always paid ¬£9 a year for next day delivery. BUT this time they have let me down and their customer service was disgusting. I purchased an item and received something completely wrong. When sending photo proof and asking for the correct item to be sent they told me they can no longer do this, but I'm more than welcome to return for a refund and re order in the mean time. This has put me out of pocket as refunds take up to 14 working days and I do not have the item I ordered. I've also had the inconvenience of having to go to the post office to return the item when I shouldn't have had to do this if the correct thing had been delivered. Customer service was completely useless, told me they couldn't help, but instead encouraged me to use their credit company Klarna to order as I wouldn't have to pay back for up to 45 days. Not only was this unhelpful but also incredible worrying that this is something they're pushing for people to do! Overall I feel completely let down, and am in two minds about ordering again as I feel it isn't something I should have to do"

Not shipped, the customer service has suggested me to go to the post office and ask for my parcel...  without a shipping code! Hilarious. They have also suggested me to wait until the 8th July and contact them the next day.  Of course, they are not replying.  Now I am seriously scared I will not get my money back, to don't mention that the dress was for a ceremony and now I have to buy another one.  And although I am not 100% convinced with the only item that has arrived I am wondering if it would be better if I keep it because the return procedure seems as bad as all the rest.  I am sad and extremely disappointed.  I have been a happy Asos customer around 2009 but now I am astonished: how could a billionaire company have such bad customer service?  I wish we could make our voices heard because it seems like there are hundreds if not thousands of customers in the same situation!"
"July 09, 2019",1,Do not use ASOS look elsewhere!,"Honestly dreadful service! Placed my order and was told to expect it within a week, that deadline came and went nothing. I chased up the order as I had been charged as soon as it was placed but still without any items they took 24 hours to get back to me and say that they were out of stock! I asked for a refund which will take a further 5-1 days. Honesty will not be using them again, very poor!"
"July 09, 2019",1,Very bad !!!,"Very bad !!!! Delivery is shocking, don‚Äôt ever order from them. Also their helpline number charges you ¬£6 so basically they are a horrible company who have no respect for their customer, definitely not satisfied !"

It‚Äôs been stuck on that for two weeks!  Customer service is a waste of time. They quote company policies at you and nothing is ever investigated or escalated. I don't know how they get away with it. I will never order from them again.

But the stupid thing happened this time I ordered , the order I made on 1st July, and they still haven‚Äôt shipped yet, and I contact with customer service, omg , their responses are unbelievable and ridiculous, they said you need to wait after 9th July then you can contact us again, but they haven‚Äôt shipped my items , and for me, if you haven‚Äôt shipped yet , then how can I receive it ? I am so tired of communicating with them, so I reported them on PayPal since I am glad that I paid with PayPal, then PayPal can investigate the case and give me the refund. To be honest, this is the last time I buy products from ASOS ."

But the last time I ordered they sent me a completely wrong size so I asked them if they can send me a size that I ordered and someone in customer service said that they can't do that. That first I need to return the product I've got and than within 45 working days (which practically is freaking 9 weeks or maybe more) they will repay me and I can order again what I want. I can't believe that a respectable (or I just thought it was) site like asos can say that especially when it's their fault. So I think I'm done with Asos at least for a year or so. What a shame...

Latest the reply has been that a specialist team member will look into the case and contact me - they've said that 6 times over the last 3 weeks. I've heard absolutely nothing. I just want my money back for something I never received.DO NOT ORDER FROM ASOS. They used to have a fair service and live up to their delivery but this is the worst - that they haven't delivered, nor informed me, nor refunded me and I placed the order in MAY.. Read all the other reviews - something is not right in this business clearly and most reviews in here are bad. They won't give you the proper communication back on any platform, facebook, twitter, chat or email - they don't care.DONT ORDER FROM ASOS!"

Three months went by (assuming everything had been processed and forgotten about) I get an overdue payment notification from Klarna, THREE MONTHS LATER!!! Did I have the returns tracking number by then? Of course not. I contacted Klarna who told me to contact ASOS, and when I contacted ASOS they told me to contact Klarna. Where does it end? It is now July, this has still not been resolved and I am being contacted by DRS to pay a debt for this bloody sweater. I've run out of options and I am so disappointed with the customer service from all sides here."
"July 09, 2019",1,Non existent after-sales service scuppers warranty,"I bought a Misfit smartwatch from them in June 2018, in June 2019 it started playing up so I spoke to Misfit who said they would honour the warranty but I'd need a proof of purchase with a sales date on it (completely reasonable). I'd lost the original so I asked ASOS for a copy of the proof of purchase, which they duly emailed, it had no sales date so I contacted support again and asked for a proof of purchase with a sales date on, and they sent me the same email again. At this point I had a contact who'd helpfully given me her name Katie so I emailed her directly asking if I could just have a VAT invoice as I needed something with a sales date on it, rather than trying to be helpful Katie then asked me for my VAT registration number (which yes, I would need for a VAT invoice but seeing as their sales invoices don't seem to carry the date of the sale seemed my only alternative). Anyway, at this point I gave up, I was clearly never going to get what I'd asked for out of them and despite Misfit offering to repair my watch ASOS clearly wanted no part of it.AVOID."

I have no idea when my item will arrive - it ""might arrive by the 11th"" is the best answer I get. Apparantly they have processed my refund for next day delivery fee, but this will take up to 2 weeks. You also can't contact their delivery company, Hermes. Apparently ASOS can't contact Hermes either, which I find very hard to believe. Overall, the standards have dropped with ASOS. Perhaps the delivery partner is new?

Not even a quick call to track the delivery or check with the driver if he had the correct parcel or address details. I've paid the annual next day delivery pass, but that clearly means nothing to ASOS - must be just a fee to make extra money, as from my experience they are not able to keep their word as a service, shameless!Today I changed my plans to wait for the courier (obviously), as I had a specific slot for my delivery. During that time period, I get an email from DPS saying that they could not deliver as there was no one home - when in fact I was... and the most frustrating thing was that they posted a picture of the wrong house, when notifying me via email.Still waiting to see what they (ASOS and DPS) can do for me.Good app with good clothing options but terrible CS team and service in general."

"July 06, 2019",5,I was a bit scared when I did my first‚Ä¶,"I was a bit scared when I did my first order because of all the bad reviews, but it has actually worked very well for me, and I just placed my third order. I had an inquiry about the first delivery, and I got in contact with customer support through their Facebook page, and they where very service minded and helped me with my questions. I like the products I have ordered as well. I will buy again."
"July 06, 2019",3,advantages,The advantages include:fast delivery;easy payment;a large assortment of goods.By cons:not always good quality products.
"July 06, 2019",1,Unprofessional and unhelpful.,Worst experience. Especially customer service. Completely up themselves and unwilling to be at all helpful. Customer service agent talking as if she knows everything and incredibly obstructive. Never using again. Avoid avoid avoid.
"July 06, 2019",1,SO BAD,"SO BAD, Made an order, no mention of delivery times being slow.I usually get stuff in 2-3 days. After checkout 10 days!!I'm gonna miss the order I'm away on Hols, so wanted to cancel.Was told I couldn't even though the order hadn't been sent.My advice if you need something quickly, don't trust them."
"July 06, 2019",1,the worst customer service ever!,"The live chat is ""useless""Very very low quality and unhelpful.Asking questions like...super nonsenseBig company like ""ASOS"" should work on something!!!!!!!"
"July 05, 2019",1,Avoid evening delivery like the plague,next day evening delivery completely awful! embarrassing a business like this can get away with it! received an email at 5.30pm telling me it was on the way and still haven't received my delivery yet and the time is now 12.40am avoid evening delivery at all costs!!!!
"July 05, 2019",1,Will never be buying from asos again‚Ä¶,"Will never be buying from asos again they used to be really helpful and prompt with their deliveries but they have gone downhill. I ordered Wednesday and i paid ¬£7.90 for Thursday evening delivery and its now Friday, i still havent received my parcel. I also had no email with shipping or tracking info so i have no idea where my parcel is. The customer service is awful you are on the live chat for ages asking for guidance and they take ages to reply and pretend they are doing something to sort it, ive emailed multiple times and they reply ‚ÄòJust to let you know we've received your email and have updated your most recent query with your new message. Our Customer Care team will be in touch as soon as they can‚Äô. And i hear nothing back this company is a joke AVOID"
"July 05, 2019",1,AVOID AVOID AVOID,"1st time ordering and will definitely be my last.I spent nearly ¬£60 on clothes and paid for years next day delivery in time for my holiday.Received my parcel, my paperwork but not my clothes..  I contacted Asos and explained but there was nothing they can do due to their new company policy. All I could do is return and re order. When I went to re order, they didnt have my sizes :@ I've had to keep chasing contacting Asos for weeks as they claiming they hadn't received my return even though i sent it via the 48 hour Royal Mail label provided with the returns label that came with the order. A supervisor or manager is never available and people from the esculated team are supposed to call you BUT DONT. Nearly a month later they are apparently refunding me but stating they cannot manually refund to PayPal which I paid with... so I need to give my card/credit card details to them.. I will not be doing this and will be contacting PayPal tomorrow as this sounds absolutely ridiculous and do not trust the company after my experience and very bad customer service throughout. AVOID AVOID AVOID."
"July 05, 2019",1,Con artists !!!,Well what can I say apart from in gobsmacked with how bad ASOS are !!! So I ordered myself and partner 3 pairs of trainers and one of the pairs was not In the parcel I emailed the customer service to let them know they haven‚Äôt been received. I got a email back today to say they are not Refunding the trainers and they are not allowing me to ever order from themAgain !!! ¬£165 down and made to feel like a criminal absolutely furious also I returned the other 2 pairs of trainers at they were both to big ! So in all at the money they have over ¬£400 of my money and all I have is a poxy bikini
"July 05, 2019",1,BIGGEST SCAM,"On the basis of my own and some of my friends¬¥ experiences I suggest that you do not count on the date on which your order will probably arrive because to be honest it will not.Do NOT spend extra money on a next-day-delivery, it will definetly not work and they just make more money of it."
"July 05, 2019",2,Poor customer service,"I used to always shop with Asos as delivery was always fast and returning anything was always easy and stress-free however with my last few purchases I have had to return things and after not receiving any emails confirming my return a week after I had done so I used the live chat that they have on the website and it was there that I was informed of what was happening with my return and the man I was chatting to was helpful when it came to answering my questions about why I hadn‚Äôt been sent an email. His response was ‚Äúyou will have been sent an email, check your spam folder‚Äù which obviously I had done before getting in contact with them and so when I told him this he terminated the chat window so their customer service team do not deliver the best customer service and I know what good customer service is as I also work in retail so I think it was very poor that this has happened not once but twice to me."
"July 05, 2019",2,Not what it used to be,"I've been shopping with asos since it first came about. However, in the past few years it's become pretty rubbish - I've had items arrive broken, late, sometimes completely the wrong item... in one instance, not at all (this was rectified). Their own brand products seem to be getting worse in quality. I used to really enjoy asos so I hope they turn this around, and I won't be shopping with them until then."
"July 05, 2019",1,Paid extra for same day delivery as I‚Ä¶,"Paid extra for same day delivery as I need the clothes before I go on holiday, they failed to do so and when I asked if they could refund the 9.95 for instant delivery, they simply ignored me. Terrible service, they need a call centre ASAP."
"July 05, 2019",1,Rubbish rubbish rubbish,The worst website I have ever ordered from. They returned my order to Asos after 2 weeks of waiting without any explanation and told me to wait 15 days to receive my money. I am furious and disappointed at how rude their customer service is.Never will I be ordering from there again.
"July 04, 2019",1,After my orders EAT passed,"After my orders EAT passed, I contacted Asos should I be worried, and was told my order was sent and it will take 10 more days to be here. 5 days later got mail where I was told they had technical issues, and my order was never sent. The dress I ordered is now out of stock, so I can't even reorder  it. I asked if Asos could throw me with price cut  for my next order (which would be only fair), but they wouldn't.Definitely  the last time I ordered from Asos. Poor service."
"July 04, 2019",1,I am sad to say that ASOS customer‚Ä¶,"I am sad to say that ASOS customer service  agents are incompetent and rude to say the least. I made a purchase of $148 and paid $20 to ship the items to me. Upon arrival i was charged $68 in duties and customs. When I opened the package I was sent wrong items. I order a two piece bikini, what they sent was two tops of different style. Needless to say I contacted them and they were like well send it back and refund you. So now that another $22.40 to send it back, so not only am I sending back the wrong top, I am also sending the correct top and the cover-up as I have ZERO need for the outfit as I had purchased it for the that weekend. The agents continued to disconnect my chats, they were passive and rude and promised to return the shipping fees. When I contacted them today to receive my shipping fee back they told me ""we cant do that"" I took a screenshot of the conversation I had with the agent who told me that i just needed to contact them after with the receipt and they would refund me and the guy I spoke with TASHAN didn't care that I was promised a refund. This is by far the worst service ever and they will never get another dollar from me EVER!"
"July 04, 2019",5,Favourite place to Shop,"Always have a brilliant experience with ASOS. Fast deliveries, easy to use website, a vast range of clothing of different prices and sizes, and very friendly customer service when asking for refunds for faulty clothing. Returns are also super easy so I never have to worry about things not fitting as I can send it straight back without any hassle!Also, a little thing to some but meaningful to me- i really love the diversity and honesty in your range of models. There's so much representation of different body types, skin colours, and abilities. I also LOVE that you don't airbrush and edit spots/scars/cellulite and other ""imperfections"". So refreshing to see normal natural bodies."
"July 04, 2019",1,I just purchased a pair of hot pink‚Ä¶,I just purchased a pair of hot pink sneakers and received them yesterday.   Today I see that everything is 20 perfect off.  I started a chat to see if I could get a price adjustment.   There answer was no they don't do that I preceded to tell them that they have the technology to issue credits and Alice said no they don't in a nasty tone. Be very careful when ordering from them their customer service is horrible.   If I could I would give them zero stars.
"July 04, 2019",1,I regret buying from this website.,"I regret buying from this website.Paid next day delivery for a peplum pencil midi dress and got an email saying the delivery has been delayed. No next delivery date was given and when I called customer service, an agent told me to 'keep whining'.VERY VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!AVOID AT ALL COST!"
"July 04, 2019",1,scam,"Asos are lying bout my order, saying they dont know where it is but it will arrive. No proof of shipping, no info about which shipping company they are using, no tracking number. Basically sent my money just so they could keep it for unknown period of time. Buyers beware. do not buy anything if you need it urgently. Customer service is only supported by bots and generic answers. no real help. Opened dispute on paypal, hope to get my money back soon with paypal help. Will never ever buy from them again."
"July 04, 2019",1,24h shipping delayed over 10 days but‚Ä¶,"24h shipping delayed over 10 days but already charged. any answer from customer service, disappointed"
"July 04, 2019",1,From brilliant to terrible,Asos is getting worse and worse. I have been a customer of ASOS for 7-8 years and from very positive service they went to terrible. Even Chinese online shops have better service. My last 3 orders had some issues: two undelivered and one had 3 out of 4 items missing (????!!). Refunds took more than a month to resolve with many emails from my side. Shame to once a brilliant shop
"July 04, 2019",1,If only I could give them total 0,If only I could give them total 0 ! The worst company I have ever seen in my whole life. I cannot explain my dissatisfaction of how they treat their customers - humans!!!! Not in any good manner! I wish this company never existed or at lease cease their training or get bankrupted in nearest possible future! I cannot understand how they can operate and how legal is that they ban customers for stupid  reasons such as for some returns made which is absolute normal when people buy clothes online if you did not know that ASOS!  For God sake stop operate in this country because what you doing is illegal and humiliating! You breach basic customer rights! I just wish that some day someone  will sue you!
"July 03, 2019",5,Orders bridesmaids dresses that range‚Ä¶,Orders bridesmaids dresses that range from a size 6 to a size 18! Really impressed with being able to get all the sizes I needed and the quality of the dresses. I also had to return 2 dresses and the process was very easy and had my refund a few days later! Really impressed with the service! Defiantly will be using again.
"July 03, 2019",1,Fraudulent thieves,"If I could rate this fraudulent company 0 stars, I would. They take advantage of thousands of people every day by never delivering their items and then not reimbursing people who never got their things. This is literally fraud!"
"July 03, 2019",1,Their should be a 0 star,"Their should be a 0 star, cause this company ASOS has the worst costumer service. They only sent you one copy of a return label and yet when you return an item they ask for a proof or a receipt. Theyre the one that printed the label for return and when you ask them to send you a copy their reply is "" I understand, however, we havent received your return and their is no tracking or receipt as proof of you returning this parcel. For this, Im unable to help you futher"". Then ended the chat. This customer sevice name BEN is rude.."
"July 03, 2019",1,Customer service is horrible,"Customer service is horrible. I returned items that didn‚Äôt fit (it was more than hundred euros) after a month I contacted the service and they told me ‚Äúto wait‚Äù it has been 5 months already, I have send around 6 mails no response :))))"
"July 03, 2019",1,Stay away from the worst online shop...,"Stay away from the worst online shop...Two  days after my next delivery order they told me to check to my neighbours because my order have left.One day after that (and only after my reminder that I have not receive anything )they told me how much they are sorry about what happen and they assure me that I will have my order by the end of next day...9 days after sadly my order has been cancelled.Note that this dress was my wedding dress!!!!!And after all , they advise me to place a new order.and  they will return my money back after 10 days ....Stay away! Dont trust them!!!"
"July 03, 2019",1,"Customer ""Service"" imploded","Everything is stellar except the customer service experience. No phone number to speak to a human and no tracking system for claims. my package arrived with $230+ items missing, and, nothing has been communicated to me regarding a resolution. I'm convinced their customer service reps are likely chat bots. It boggles the mind how a company the size of Amazon can get this so right, and ASOS (who ships their deliveries in plastic bags) seems to have no plan for this issue to which they're prone. I had the same thing happen a few years ago with a single item and the issue was resolved within the first communication. Not sure what has gone so spectacularly wrong with their Customer Service operations, but this long time customer and brand supporter will seriously consider shopping elsewhere in perpetuity."
"July 03, 2019",1,Stay away!,I placed an order 3 weeks ago and yesterday I was informed that my order was cancelled without mentioning any reason. They said that they will refund me within 10 days. I hope it's true. Worst site ever. I'll never order again.
"July 03, 2019",1,This is the worst experience online‚Ä¶,"This is the worst experience online ever. Still after 10 days not received the order which I spis to get next day. Only standard answers on the chat - sorry it is delayed. No response at customer service, no tracking id.... etc etc"

My enquiry was dealt with promptly and a replacement pair of sunglasses was received 2 days later. Issues was dealt with without any fuss, great customer service as far as i'm concerned. I'll gladly deal with them again"
"July 03, 2019",1,Asos order didn't arrive,I would never order from asos again. My order didn't arrive and i ordered exactly 17 days ago and they also took my money. It's really bad üëé
"July 03, 2019",1,Shocking customer service,Shocking customer service. Unable to amend orders after they‚Äôre placed which is ridiculous.No one is willing to help or advise within the Asos team. Great shame as it once was a respectable company who provided excellent customer after care.
"July 02, 2019",1,"dirty, worn product!","I ordered a pair of shoes and was sent a dirty, worn pair. Absolutely disgusting and no help from the online chat service. Disappointed!"
"July 02, 2019",1,They keep blocking my accounts,They keep blocking my accounts for ‚Äòsuspicious activity‚Äô for no reason at all.
"July 02, 2019",1,I placed an order and got free 2 day‚Ä¶,"I placed an order and got free 2 day shipping, confirmation email told me it would be arriving on June 28th. Checked the tracking number to see where it was on July 2nd four days after it was suppose to arrive and it says expected arrival July 6th. Not only did they not send it express shipping but it was send USPS non expedited shipping so it cannot be delivered to my house and would have to go to my PO Box. I talked to a customer service rep and he told me they could not do anything until July 9th, 11 days after it was suppose to arrive."
"July 02, 2019",4,Great clothes and easy refunds,"I did 3 recent orders with Asos and had no problems at all. I ordered through Klarna , which is perhaps why my refund was received quickly and transferred smoothly. The parcels did arrive on the due date ( standard delivery ), however I did do one next day delivery which I paid ¬£5.95 for , but did not receive the next day. I emailed their customer service and they replied quickly, saying that I had ordered after 12pm so therefore it would come two days later, not one. This was fine for me, but the website had told me if I paid for next day, I would receive it the next day, so  it would have been a lot more useful if they actually made this delivery date estimate  more accurate. I did email them back asking if I could have my next day delivery fee refunded as it didn‚Äôt come the next day and this could have been very inconvenient for me however I was told it wasn‚Äôt possible.Overall, ASOS has a great range of products and uses partially recycled delivery packaging ( a bonus !) , their customer service was good, however I would have liked more details on the next day delivery as I had paid it all for nothing !"
"July 02, 2019",1,"""Next working day delivery""? more like Next NIGHT delivery....","Even though I paid for ""Next working day delivery"" the order still has not showed up on the given delivery day, and all I was told by the Asos online service staff was to wait untill the end of the day, which would be 12pm and it is now 9.30pm. The shop where I am to pick up the parcel closes at 10pm, which means I won't be able to pick the parcel up if it even is delivered within the next 2,5 hours. It's such a shame that I was to pay extra money for a faster delivery, when it didn't live up to it's standards. At least Asos should inform everyone that it depends on their pick-up-shop's closing time, because unfortunately they only deliver at midnight. I am lucky that I still have a few hours before my flight tomorrow, but I will never buy from Asos again, at least not until they fix their delivery methods. And if I am not getting a notifications or email saying that the order has been delivered before 12pm, I will demand my money back, at least the money I spend on the delivery."
"July 02, 2019",1,THE WORST ONLINE SHOP!,"I ordered some stuffs from ASOS on 26th of June, in order to receive my order soon, I did paid for the next-day-delivery. However, until now, I receive NOTHING FROM ASOS. They have the worst customer service ever, they treated their customer like I am begging them for something. I contacted them via multiple channels:- Facebook: No answer at all.- Twitter (Tweets + DM): No answer at all.- Email: No answer at all.- Quick chat via their website (here was the chat script):***Here is your ASOS chat transcript:Me[15:05:10] I want my money backASOS[15:07:18] You're now chatting to Daniel[15:09:26] Hi Gia, thanks for getting in touch.Me[15:09:40] Hi DanielASOS[15:10:17] Please get in touch with our dutch team- via this link...Me[15:10:23] Today, I received an email from ASOS stated that I will soon receive my ""next-day-delivery"" fee backASOS[15:10:26] ASOS have ended the chat[15:10:27] I will now close the chat.***I did contact them several times via their ""CHAT NOW"" channel (available on their website) and that was the typical answer I got from them.My advice:Let's go to the bank and create a case against this online shop to claim your money back and NEVER BUY STUFF FROM THIS SHOP!!!"
"July 02, 2019",1,Disappointed,"Shopped with ASOS for many years! Recently the costumer service is shockingly poor, get no straight answers. I have been waiting for a refund for 3 weeks. Very disappointed."
"July 02, 2019",1,I ordered something from them June 6th‚Ä¶,I ordered something from them June 6th 2019. Was told the delivery date was June 27th. And it is past June 27th and I have no parcel. They can't provide me a tracking number. They cant tell me where my shipment is. They tell me to contact my local post office..Well guess what they cant help me with out a tracking number. I was told if my parcel wasn't here by July 19th to contact them again. That's well over a month for the ETA. I will NEVER order anything from this POS company again.
"July 02, 2019",1,When did asos delivery service get so‚Ä¶,When did asos delivery service get so bad? Standard delivery taking over 8 days to arrive! So disappointing! Parcels used to arrive so promptly
"July 02, 2019",2,Worst Customer Service Ever...like babies behind a computer.,"Today I made a purchase with a promo code for almost $200. Immediately after the purchase completed I noticed it was shipping standard and not express as I had indicated. I engaged chat, which is the only option available b/c unlike the thousands of other online shopping services, they don't have a phone #. Okay. So, the first customer rep said I need to wait an hour b/c my order was ""not in the system"", and then chat back. I did so. The second rep I spoke to was so rude and robotic and just keep quoting policy without any concern, saying I ""missed the cancellation period."" What?! I only missed it b/c of what I was told earlier. Then she started blaming me for entering the promo, but not ""claiming it properly"", and hung up on me mid-chat. I spoke with 3 customer service reps, and only the third was helpful, but by that time it was too late to do anything. This seriously can not be how ASOS treats customers. They couldn't even handle the most basic inquiry. There was literally nothing that could be accomplished. I have no clue why they even have a customer service system. You can't speak with a live person. You can't CHANGE ANYTHING, and the only thing they can do is cancel your order, oh, but only in the first 5min to an hour! ...great selection on ASOS, but worst customer service ever. Be careful before you purchase anything, you will get no assistance what-so-ever."
"July 02, 2019",1,Save your money,It took Asos over three weeks to email me that the product that I ordered was sold out. I had contacted them plenty of times bc it hadn‚Äôt been sent out and they told me to ask my neighbors if it had been sent to them even though it never got dispatched. I need to wait for at least 2 weeks to get my money back and didn‚Äôt get any refunds. Asos is trash nowadays
"July 02, 2019",2,TERRIBLE DELIVERY,"Love ASOS and the range of clothes it has, but my god what a TERRIBLE CHOICE OF DELIVERY COURIER. What's the point of the great range and ease of orders when Yodel doesn't deliver to you (and lie that they did!)"
"July 02, 2019",1,Horrible!,I have just received an e-mail from them that my account is going to be blocked because of too many returns! I have been their customer from 2006! Amazing!
"July 02, 2019",1,Customer Service is seriously unacceptable,The customer service from ASOS is appalling. I have now been sent 3 incorrect Klarna invoices trying to charge me for the full amount when I returned 95% of the package. Cannot get any answers from their customer service team and have been told 'I do not need to continue getting in touch with them' over this. Yet I have a payment deadline of tomorrow for ¬£250 of product I RETURNED and have the confirmation of return. This is my credit rating at risk and the online chat staff are incredibly rude and couldn't care less about it. I absolutely will never use ASOS again after the stress this has caused. I have been chasing this up for 2 weeks now with no resolution. Disgusting customer service.
"July 02, 2019",1,Unacceptable customer service,"I have ordered from ASOS for years but just recently I have found their customer service unacceptable. I placed an order for ¬£100 using my premier delivery. I received an email to say my order would be with me the next day. It never arrived. I called Asos the following day to be told by Julie that I have to wait a further 4 working days (5 in total) and if my order doesn‚Äôt turn up I should then call for them to refund or replace. I expressed that this is not what I would expect for next day delivery. She then told me that apparently this is all in my terms and conditions. So please beware do not rely on next day delivery or that Asos will have any interest in assisting you in the event your order goes missing but they are quite happy to keep my ¬£100 for a further 4 days before they will even try and resolve this for me.Update..the items arrived 5 days later in Hermes packaging with no returns label or sheet. Two items missing and two faulty. They sent out the missing items which took a further 3 days. The faulty items had clearly been worn, had no tags on and looked like they had come out of someone‚Äôs wash basket. One was discoloured and the other had faulty buttons. I was asked to return these for replacements to be sent. I returned them once I printed my own returns label and sheet, requesting replacements. I received an email yesterday telling me my refund had been processed for ¬£4! The items o returned amounted to ¬£24. As I had used a spend and save voucher they have removed my discount from the whole order and refunded me only ¬£4. I queried why they have refunded when I wanted replacements only to be told the items were out of stock. This was a complete lie because I checked and both had plenty of stock. Anyway all they could offer me was another promo code so I‚Äôd have to spend another ¬£100...I think not!!! Absolutely terrible Asos!!!"
"July 02, 2019",1,I live in Sweden and boy was I‚Ä¶,I live in Sweden and boy was I delusional thinking they got better after my last order some years before. Big surprise... I have issues again. I received the order but the items wore nothing like the photo so I sended them back the same day. I am still waiting for my refund. Their customer care is a total joke. All they say is will look into it. Sometimes is like a robot generated answer.Besides from never ever ordering from them again I wonder how come their still open. We should all file a lawsuit against this company.
"July 01, 2019",1,Absolutely terrible customer service,"Absolutely terrible customer service. The brand and Asos ethos seems to have deteriorated.Latest issue that means I will no longer be shopping with them is; had an order delivered that was left outside in my garden, even though the porch was noted as the safe space. Apparently because I have said they can leave in a safe space that means the parcel is my responsibility regardless of the fact the courier left it in view of a busy street and was stolen, and they will not refund or send a replacement! Message after message I have sent and I have no idea why they cannot do something, I even have the images showing how the courier left the parcel as they were sent as an update through the couriers app! But no, apparently proof isn‚Äôt enough and it‚Äôs my responsibility?"
"July 01, 2019",1,Never got my package and they took my‚Ä¶,"Never got my package and they took my moneyNever got my package, customer service just tell me that my neighbors stole it... I have no neighbors and it was supposed to be delivered to a post house. They're not planning on giving my money back.... Would not recommend if u don't want to be scammed"
"July 01, 2019",1,Have all your customer service staff went on Love Island too?,"I have been an ASOS customer for years. In the last year the company has went right down hill. No longer get points (VIP), customer service getting worse, late deliveries and lack of real ''Sales''.I am no longer going to order from them. Latest issue is that my last 2 orders have been cancelled due to items being out of stock after placing the order but holding onto your money for a few days first before telling me item is no longer available. After receiving notification from them that item is out of stock and them cancelling my order the item/s 24 hours later remarkably come back in stock, but the sale or the voucher you used on the original order has expired so if you want to order again then its full price."
"July 01, 2019",1,Rubbish company,"Rubbish company - paid for next day delivery.  Was informed on the expected day of delivery that delivery was going to take another day, but no sign of refunding the costly postage paid for next day delivery.  When I contacted them, they didn't seem to understand the issue!  Never using them again - unprofessional."
"July 01, 2019",5,Asos is the best,Asos is the best! Get stuff from here all the time
"July 01, 2019",1,Terrible customer service,"Terrible customer service! They avoid answering the simplest questions. The support team should probably change their name because the last thing they offer is support. It's a good store, but if you have any trouble along the way, you are in for a ride. Besides every customer service rep being rude and off putting, I have never been able to get any help from them. Even when the help I need is as simple as tracking a package or questions about a return.Need to improve your customer support, probably worse than airlines."
"July 01, 2019",1,Bad customer service and long delays,Very long delay on order delivery and the worst customer service! Avoid ordering for that reason alone!
"July 01, 2019",1,BEWARE of FREE returns!,"Ordered 45$ pants from this company and they didn't fit like 90% of things from this place. So I sent the item back with the return label provided, well anyway fast forward 3 weeks later and still no return so I contact the customer service rep and CHARLIE proceeds to tell me that I need proof of the return label that THEY provided for me. I don't know where the receipt is from UPS I assumed they had a copy just like NIKE, TARGET, WALMART, Standard stuff. I guess I should have known better not to buy anything from a UK company! They may have different laws there IDK!"
"July 01, 2019",1,"WON'T REFUND ME, PUT ME THROUGH ENDLESS LOOPS","Dear ASOS, I am writing this hoping that someone will see it and be able to help me as I find myself in the worst experience I have ever had with an online store. I placed an order with ASOS on Monday March 19th and received it not long after that. After trying the different items within this order I decided to return some things.When I went to return this order I had realised that the card I used to buy these items was stolen from me. Because that card was stolen from me I closed the bank account associated with that card. That bank account was closed on April 3rd. I notified your customer service team about this before returning these items and you assured me that it would not be an issue and that you would help me obtain my refund. Once the refund was ""processed"" you had informed me that the bank account that I had closed accepted the refund and that I needed to get in contact with that bank in order to receive my refund. I went into the bank and told them what you had said and they told me that my bank account was indeed closed and that it was impossible for any funds to have gone into it. They double checked and confirmed that there was no refund. I replied back and told you this, you told me to go back to the bank and have them right a personal letter stating that my bank account was closed (this after I already gave you my closing bank statement). I went back to the bank and explained to them what you requested of me. They explained that they never do this and that I should only need a closing bank statement. After much discussion they finally gave me a personal letter stating that my bank account was indeed closed on April 3rd. I gave you this letter and you agreed to do a ""one off"" to refund me to my current bank account.Fast forward to now. I decided to make a second return on that same order on April 26th. I wanted to avoid any sort of confusion & frustration on this second return as it was purchased on the same stolen card/bank account. To be safe I got in contact with your customer care team and asked them to help make sure that the refund didn't go to that old card (which i deleted off my account because you said it would solve issues). You promised me that if there were any issues that you would help me get my refund to my current bank account.Sure enough, the same thing happened the second time as did the first. You replied to me saying that my old bank account had accepted my refund. Frustrated at this point I contacted you again and explained that this bank account was closed and it had been closed since April 3rd. Since that contact with you I have had 24 back and forth emails, 15 online chat sessions, DM's to your social media accounts, 2 calls from your team telling me to go back into the bank, gone back and forth to and from the bank having them write multiple letters telling you that they don't have my refund money and I am so far beyond frustrated. You constantly tell me to do something to prove that they don't have the money, then I do that and you still tell me that there is nothing you can do. The simple reality is that I don't have my refund and you have made me go through so many loops over these last couple of months to try and obtain it. I have done everything that you have requested and it still isnt enough for you to give me my proper refund. WHEN WILL YOU GIVE ME MY REFUND? Please have someone who has common sense look at my case and organise my refund. I have tried to be nice but after months of this and over 50 forms of communication I am at the end of my rope. I am severely disappointed in the way I have been treated and I am sure I am not the only one."

The representatives I spoke to about this shrugged it off and said, well you‚Äôll have to wait the week, nothing we can do and shut the chat."
"July 01, 2019",1,I would give them a zero,I would give them a zero if it was possible. I ordered on the 22nd of May and was supposed to receive the dress on the 11th of June. I tried to communicate with their customer service and they refused to give me a tracking number and they advised that i should look in my neighborhood and the postal office. I checked both but in vain. They advised that i shall wait till the 1st of July and they will not do anything before that because it is their procedure. Noting that i had the event that i am supposed to wear the dress that i ordered on the 24th of June. I had to buy another one from some place else in a short period of time! and they wouldn't careless. They are just robots answering the inquiry and when i tried to escalate my issue they said no escalations and they ended the chat immediately!

Ordered item for 150‚Ç¨ and it was written near order ""Estimated delivery 13 Jun, 2019"", Today its already ""July 01"" and item is still not received. Wrote numerous of times to support and still do not understand if they shipped it or no. No tracking number provided. Last time contacted support 4 days ago - no respond till now. To my address I already received numerous of other orders from UK and China which I ordered AFTER order from 'asos'."
"July 01, 2019",1,Poor customer service and 0 value from premium delivery,"I am paying for premium delivery with Asos, which means orders are supposed to be delivered the next working day. However have placed an order on June 20 and as of today, July 1st, the order has not even been shipped from their warehouse and every time i try to contact someone about it through chat, email etc. they just say that they are very happy to look into this issue for me and will get back to me, and then nothing happens. Extremely poor customer service."
"July 01, 2019",1,I had the worst experience with asos,"I had the worst experience with asos. I bought four items on the 10th of June 2019. On the 14th I received an e-mail with a tracking number. On the 19th the tracking device stated that the parcel would be delivered on the 19th. But nothing happened and the parcel didn't get delivered. So I wrote to customer service, who asked me to hold my patience until the 27th. On the 27th the parcel still wasn't delivered. So I wrote again on the the 27th and the 28th, but with no answer. Again I wrote on the 1st of July - this time with reply. Apparently the parcel had been lost. So instead they ordered a replacement order. But in the meantime one of the items had been sold out, so this wouldn't be included in the new order. Furthermore two of the items were ordered with wrong sizes. So again I had to write customer-service to have this fixed. Apparently the e-mail had wrongly stated that the sold-out item would not be included as it was actually one of the other items with the wrong size. As regards he other item with the wrong size at first they wouldn't admit that they had ordered it wrong, but as they admitted the size was actually wrong, they didn't want to do anything about it even though I wrote to them less than an hour after receiving the e-mail regarding the replacement order. So now I'm receiving an item that dosen't fit and I have to use more useless time on returning it. This whole experience have been so confusing and with such bad service. I will NEVER recommend anyone to order from ASOS. Their service is the worst."

But now...ordered in may, paid 20 eur for next day delivery (3rd day really to my country). But i still don't have my order and also they can't refund yet. 400 eur they are using. Is there any system that guaranties I can get refund."
"June 30, 2019",1,Min 26 day refunds,"I recently returned an item, which after 20 days has not been acknowledged or refunded. I will have to wait 10 for the funds to be returned once they process the return. Unfortunately I foolishly and without thinking placed another order, which will take 8 days before being delivered. Despite the long wait, the money has been taken and I am not able to cancel the order 3 hours later. I now realise that after waiting 8 days, if I send back immediately, it will take 9 days for the process the return and a further 10 days for money to be refunded. That's a total of 26 days that ASOS have my money. Much if this is because they are 'busier than usual' so have changed their terms & conditions. I for one will help them to reduce quite how busy they are by taking my custom elsewhere; perhaps others feel the same? Absolutely atrocious turnaround in what was previously a great level of service"
"June 30, 2019",5,Never had a bad experience with ASOS,"TBH, I never had a bad experience with ASOS. Also they are lifesavers if you live somewhere abroad, where they don't have a good selection of clothing stores. Their delivery is cheap and I never had problems with it. The returns are super simple and the product selection is great. As a petite girl, I absolutely love it."

It is now 10:57pm and still no order.I've contacted AGAIN the customer service to receive an update. They said that i will receive my order 5 days later due to a delay ... Couldn't they have explained to me that over the phone ?? or email me ? I've asked to cancel my order as i will then be away, they've been unhelpful saying that after delivery attempts the package will be returned to them .... how long will i then have to wait until a receive my refund ? this is a mystery. All these inconvenience that I the customer have to swallow, without even an apology. Can't guarantee a delivery and bad customer service experience Also they did not offer to refund my express delivery fees (as it was not delivered as per the delivery window) , which would have been expected and received with any other online store.Usually a fervent and loyal customer to ASOS, but this time the customer service went down by 100 points. Won't shop again."

They then held my money they had taken which they blamed on a Tec error for 10 days before refunding it! The customer service agent was so rude! Not even an apology!  Said I couldn't speak witn anyone, and that I couldn't deal with anyone else. The order than took over 7 days to arrive I contacted customer service to be told they are busy! Again no apology at all! The items arrived and wish are better quality and the sizing is awful! I returned the whole ¬£75 order the next day. I have now been told 10 days later by another rude customer service agent that it takes 9 working days to get back to them and a further 7 days for them to refund you. But they are busy at this time so these times will be longer!!!! Never ordering again! Out ¬£75 for a month so far! (Due to paying twice in the first place!)"

"June 29, 2019",4,So here's the thing with Asos,"So here's the thing with Asos. Clothes may not look the same as they did online and quality might not be as good as expected when you buy the cheapest brands they offer. You may get lucky though and get some cheap nice stuff, it's not all bad quality in my experience. They do offer other quality brands you can buy albeit for a higher price point. You get what you pay for, and a 5 quid jumper is not going to be great and not a reason to moan online.Shipping is quick and returns are easy. You can use the same packaging they used to send your stuff, it comes with a slip you can fill in and you only need to drop it off at the post office. Once they receive your return, they'll refund you pretty quick. This has happened to me a few times and I've never had any issues with it. However, if you try to get any customer service from them it's only going to make things difficult for you. It's slow and useless, so don't even try. If you have any issues just return the item for a refund, if you need a smaller size just buy a new one and return the other one. The returns process is so easy that it's not worth getting worked up over their customer service."

Contacted customer service, worse experience with 0 help. Refused to recall my order and provide a refund. I know they did not send it with 2 day delivery.I decided to order the same items yesterday and PAID for the 2 day shipping option and surprise, no not at all actually. My items have shipped out with an estimated delivery date of Monday 7/1. I paid so now they will honor the 2 day shipping but the free 2 day shipping with a minimum purchase amount is a lie. I will be contacting the Better Business Bureau, this is poor and deceptive business practices. Shame on you Asos for misleading your customers just so they will spend more without the intent of honoring the free 2 day shipping."
"June 29, 2019",1,If something goes wrong you're on your own,"I've been using asos for years and for the most part, everything works fine and no complaints.However, I recently made an order with next day delivery. It just never dispatched. Asos' order page hasn't changed its status from ""We've got it!"", I haven't received an email that it's been dispatched nor have I received any notifications from any carriers saying I have a package on the way.Customer service is f***** worthless. They give you a copy paste response about checking with your neighbours and post office. If you're not happy with this response, they will tell you to wait until the end of the day/wait until tomorrow/wait until this weekend/etc etc just so you leave.Finally, my order was forwarded to their ""specialist team"" and you get no confirmation of this. Just sit and wait hoping this autistic seal team 6 finally gets in touch with you. I was told 24-48 hours for a specialist team response and 5 days later with no response, I get back in touch with support.They tell me that I cannot get a refund for my order until this ""specialist team"" looks into what went wrong. What the f***. My order was never dispatched and it's 2 weeks past my original order date (with next day delivery) and they are telling me I can't have my money back for an order they never f****** sent out. They basically took my money, gave me nothing and still just tell me to wait.The cherry on top is when they told me that because I contacted support again after 5 days of no response, I am relegated to the back of the support queue, meaning I have to start my wait for this magical specialist team all over again.Absolutely f****** absurd, luckily I paid via PayPal and will be issuing a chargeback through them. Again, usually everything goes fine but God forbid something goes wrong and they just try to f*** you and f*** with you in every which way they can. It's absurd how f****** braindead their customer service policies are. Instead of helping a long term customer who has spent hundreds and thousands over the years and would continue to shop with them, they f*** them over on their own mistake for a ¬£50 order. Way to lose a customer, hope it was worth it."
"June 29, 2019",1,Horrible customer service,"I have just attempted to inquire about returning a faulty item purchased from ASOS. It took the chat consultant almost 20 minutes to tell me they couldn't actually help me! All this person did was elevate the issue to a 'specialist team' who will respond to me within a lightning 24 hours, then couldn't tell me why a specialist team was even necessary. It's a simple return. Apparently ASOS pride themselves on their easy and fast returns - fail to see how. When I asked the consultant why their responses were taking so long, they (eventually) suggested it was my internet connection. I suggested it might be theirs and they quite arrogantly asserted they were not experiencing any issues at that time. When I queried that, the consultant (suddenly quite rapidly) informed me that they were dealing with more than one customer at a time. I suggest therein lies the problem and that ASOS don't employ enough customer service consultants, they have a clunky and inefficient internal process for addressing returns/issues, and certainly either don't give customer service staff appropriate customer service training, or don't actually monitor the quality of their service. At no point did this person apologise for any delays or my dissatisfaction with the responses provided. Hopeless. ASOS, there are many, many other online market places who have excellent and efficient customer service, so it's time to step up."

"June 28, 2019",1,No value given to customer,ASOS has such a bad customer service that I can't give them even a star . They definitely deserve less negative rating from my side. I was checking for my returns on their chat box but they were responding after 15 minutes . I pinged her twice or thrice just to remind her that I am waiting for her reply. Also when I asked her query she gave me only specific response and did not make efforts to clarify my queries .I asked her if she could divert me to specific person who can clarify my queries but she jut ended chat .I wish I could attach screenshot of our chat here. \rfeally upset with their service . I do not want to buy from ASOS now only because of their customer service.

I purchase on average four dresses per month and have never had an issue regarding returns nor delivery. I paid for Express Delivery which is ¬£9.99 for 12 months and can say that ASOS have never let me down. Unlike other online stores, the return process is easy and well managed as there are a great many options for returns which is very convenient. Once they receive your item, they send an email confirmation, and adivse when your money will be refunded.My number one shopping brand, as they are prompt with good value for money and a knowledgeable customer service team."

When they hadn't arrived by 6/27/19, I checked the tracking status to discover they had been delivered to my old address, over 1000 miles away. I contacted customer service via chat (because they do not provide a phone number, I assume that's because they experience so many issues) and explained their system had made a mistake and delivered my package to my old address. My correct delivery address is on my profile on their site, and it could not be there unless I had entered it when I placed my order as I had not previously ordered from this address. Customer service told me I would need to retrieve the package myself or have the new tenant return the package to ASOS at which point they would give me a refund. When I explained that neither option was possible as I now lived over 1000 miles away and did not know the new tenant and had no way of contacting them to retrieve my package, they told me there was nothing else they could do. When I requested that I be transferred to their management, they refused. When I asked what I was supposed to do, they said the new tenant at my old address may return it to ASOS. I explained this was not plausible and that I needed to be issued a refund as I hadn't received the products I paid for and it was due to an error on their end, they replied that ""sometimes it happens."" I insisted that I be refunded my money and they cut off the chat, when I started another chat they left me on hold for as long as they could, and then repeated the same lines and cut off the chat again. So I have now paid over $160 and haven't received a single thread of clothing. They are stealing from customers. DO NOT TRUST THEM AND DO NOT ORDER FROM ASOS.

Normally Asos always took 5-6 days for delivery in my previous 15 orders. Trusting it will go well again i placed my order 2 weeks prior to my holiday. After seein it's not been dispatched aftr 5 days of my order i enquired and received a generic email promising only 2-3 days of delay and i realized the new delivery date kept getting pushed away every time i asked about my package. now i want to cancel but there's no such option. After reading many comments from people that have been waiting for more than a month and still no news, i lost hope. I will not shop from Asos again and advise people not to until they change their cancellation policy."
"June 26, 2019",1,Bad customer service and false advertising,"They changed return policy recently in some countries so it's not free anymore to return unwanted items. Return fee is ridiculously expensive. At the time I placed my order, the return was still free and they still advertised to have free return on their website. That's why I ordered one items in 2 different sizes to see which one fits me better. But when I tried to create a return label, it was no longer fee. I understand that I'll have to pay to return if I had placed the order after they changed the policy. But in my case, I felt like I was lied to. I contacted their customer support and they weren't helpful at all, just replied as if they were robots. I'll not shop at Asos anymore after this customer service catastrophe."

Despite having a proof that I had returned an item and it was received by ASOS according to the tracking number, ASOS has not refunded my money. If ASOS' business model is to scam people by taking returns and not refunding money, then I should probably gather all the persons on TrustPilot who has not received their refunds and file for a class action lawsuit. Terrible company. I will never ever do business with ASOS again."

First of all, the only way to contact them is via social media, which would've been ok, if they had real human beings monitoring these things. Over the years I've bought great stuff from them and hardly had any problem, even though I've had to pay exorbitant customs fees. I still continued shopping with them, as I love the quality stuff they sell. In recent years, Asos seems to have gotten too conceited for their own good. On May 22, I made a purchase , received an email May 24, saying my order has been shipped. To date I haven't received the item and no one will give me a definitive answer, besides wait until July 2nd before anything can be done. I keep messaging them asking for an answer, it appears they've become tired of me. Now they only send out the same old computer activated message saying: Check with neighbours, etc. Which is impossible, my purchase all go to Penguin Pickup. I purchase the same item again as  I really need it, they did not even send me an email confirmation. The only proof I have is my credit card charge. I asked why, they sent me the same tired message. No Canadian  or US company has ever treated me this way! I won't be buying from Asos again. There are too many other online retailers with better business sense and respect for customers!"

Then it turned up late. The second order turned up with the wrong pair of shoes.I contacted live chat customer service and was just met with copy and paste responses, barely an apology. And just told to send back and I can get a refund. Then the chat cut off. They used to care if you received the wrong item and send you the correct one out straight away with the condition you return the wrong item within a certain time. They have lost their personal touch, I don‚Äôt feel like a valued customer anymore. I‚Äôve been using Asos since it first was set up. But this will be the last time.

I PAY annually for next day delivery but I never receive it the next day and when I went to complain about a refund or compensation, they said to follow their social media for promotions! The clothing was supposed to come 5 days later than the next day and no compensation whatsoever.Their clothing is really unflattering to anyone who isn't sized 6 and tall. So much for their campaigns."

I don‚Äôt understand the point. also, i could careless about getting my items in two days. i never expect fast shipping when shopping overseas. they pay all duties and taxes for american customers but charge us whatever they want while claiming to have our best interests at heart by throwing us 15% off."

But it does have its cons as well!ProsThe product selection grows from year to year and I know that when the high street lets me down I can always rely on ASOS to deliver something i like!premier delivery - ¬£9.99 for a year is worth every penny, over 9 years i have only ever had a small hand full of delivery issues and i think it might be due to me using premier delivery - guaranteed next day delivery and an easy returns process (as far as ticking a box and sticking a return label on the front!) my area delivers Asos via DPD which i don't really get many problems with.a mixture of own brand and high street products - well why pay for delivery on that item I want from river island or new look if they have it on ASOS and you get free delivery?ConsSizing and sells outs - considering how big asos are I do think they need to up their game when it comes to getting accurate sizing details and replenishment of sell-out items - as a customer there is nothing worse than finding something you love... then seeing its only available in a UK size 4...customer service - over the past 9 years the customer service has definitely taken a turn for the worst. Response times are not great and then the physical responses are so scripted it defeats the point in trying to contact them....delivery - when i do on occasion have a delivery issue (mainly with Hermes!) ASOS are not at all helpful and state the issue lies with the courier (which it does 9 times out of 10) but i feel that asos should take on a bit more responsibility - especially when you look through these reviews and can see that the vast majority are due to delivery or logistic issues"

I pay for next day delivery but Hermes delivers whenever it feels like it with no update on tracking or explanation from them. ASOS do not take responsibility for this and extend the delivery window (without having any idea of when it will actually be delivered by Hermes) simply to get rid of you. Customer service agents are borderline rude when on live chat and mostly respond with pre-prepared, scripted messages.When trying to make a complaint about non-delivery, I was told the people who would deal with that don't speak to customers (?!)Then when trying to make a complaint about the dismal customer service I was told to contact - you've guessed it - customer services! Who then tell you the people who deal with that don't talk to customers. It's an absolute farce and for a company the size of ASOS, frankly, embarrassing! Customer service investigating a complaint against themselves says it all really..."

Never received package for which I have paid three weeks ago and they keep ignoring and sending the same unuseful messages like sorry you did not receive your package and wait for another week.

Normally I get the package, try on the clothes, and send back what I didn‚Äôt like the next day. They include postage in the package so all you have to do is put it on the package and drop it off at a usps drop off. WELL a couple of weeks ago I got a package and I didn‚Äôt like 2 of the items. So I did what I always do, drop it off at the blue usps drop off. It‚Äôs been well over 10 business days and I have yet to see a credit or a return email for my items. I contacted customer service and they pretty much told me that because I didn't have PROOF OF POSTAGE, they couldn‚Äôt do anything. Why would I need proof of postage when ASOS sent me the postage? I‚Äôm sure a lot of people do not get proof of postage because it‚Äôs supposed to be an ‚Äúeasy return‚Äù. You‚Äôre a real joke ASOS."

This was a completely different style and colour.I immediately contacted them to see if anything could be done for me as the wedding was now tomorrow and I had no outfit. I explained I will post it back to them and show proof of postage, but they refused to post a new one out to me so I could have something to wear.Customer service on Facebook was terrible! In the space of an hour, I had spoken to 4 different employees, all of whom told me to post the dress back and wait for a refund to be processed. No compassion or consideration for my situation in the slightest.I then requested to be compensated with a discount code as I would now need to purchase a new dress for tomorrow and pay for next day delivery again, only to be told I couldn't have one. Luckily I called them rather than dealing with the imbecile's on Facebook chat, and I spoke to a lovely gent who was shocked at the appalling approach the staff had on social media. He immediately gave me a 15% discount code to use when I wish and refunded the next day delivery to me.Think the staff who deal with Facebook chat need re-training and an attitude adjustment. They still havent replied to my last message which I sent 4 weeks ago aha!"

But this was really the final straw. I ordered a Lacoste hoodie, blue size small. It turned up and was a large! Under the consumer rights act, it broke almost every assurance. My first day delivery was negligible as I had to wait over a week for a refund, I could no longer use my 20% universal or 25% student code (as every person has limited finances) and the ASOS team refuse to allow you to speak to anyone over a phone. All of their responses via messenger are automated and their customer care team doesn‚Äôt even reply to email complaints.Appalling service from a disorganised company. No wonder they‚Äôve had 2 warehouse fires, with this lack of planning.Shame."

I understand and am well aware that deliveries are of no fault of the company and understand that some circumstances are unforseen. However, when sharing my concern and complaints to Asos about a delivery which had been 4 days late (having paid for a yearly subscription of ¬£9.99), their simple response was they could not do anything about it and rather I should wait until an additional 4 days maximum to receive me order. The team were well aware that they had put me at great inconvenience however, were adamant they could do nothing to compensate for the inconvenience they had caused. This is a re occuring issue I have been facing with Asos recently, and as a former loyal customer to them advise you buy your item else where as the customer service you will receive is likely to be much better. Kind regards."

I then emailed the company to explain my frustration and to cancel my order immediately as I had placed an order with another website and received it the next day. They are refusing to cancel my order because my order is packed (it‚Äôs been packed since Tuesday apparently) this is possibly the worst experience and service I have ever had to deal with.

I then received an email telling me I would receive a partial refund for the difference, only to be then told it had been sent in error!!By the time I received these replies it was 10 days after and the pyjamas were now out of stock for me to re order at the cheaper price!ASOS couldn't give a damn and although ADMITTED they made a mistake by telling me they would refund, refused to honor the refund! They were so rude and patronising about it even though they were in the wrong. Vile!!!!!!! Do not use. Spend your money elsewhere"
"June 20, 2019",1,Does not send out what you have ordered! Keeps money!,"Bought 5 pairs of trainers off these #%*¬•^ and was only sent one pair. When i enquired about the other 4, they basically said things dont go missing, blocked my account, advised me that any more correspondence regarding this issue will be ignored, and to make a claim through my credit card company. Absolute joke of a company! Rest assured ASOS it will not end there, i will not let you rob my money without a fight! Gutted i had to give this joke of a company one star!! Avoid like the plague!!"

"June 20, 2019",4,Hello everyone!,Hello everyone!It's a time to re-new the wardrobe for the summer:) I've got great swimming suite on the special 'summer' sale. Haven't arrived yet so I decided to contact them. After 4 days of waiting for reply my coolest suite arrived:)Please keep it up with such sales but pay attention to speed of your assistance team.
"June 20, 2019",3,'ve ordered Adidas sneakers,"Wanted to share my expereience using ASOS:I have ordered a paris of Adidas sneakers a month ago.It was sent to me without any delays, but the package literally lost somewhere, it could not be tracked. I have contacted the delivery company and they have not received the package too.The customer support is literally the worst I've ever met. They had no information regarding the package and did not agree to refund.After several days, they told me that the package will be returned to them. Wanna know what happened next? I've received the package in two days after it happened.The items are great, the overall experience is not so good. If you do not care about delivery time and so on, feel free to order items but do not hope that CS will help you."
"June 20, 2019",1,Terrible service provider,Terrible service provider! Customer Services that LIE to the consumer even though you can clearly see the tracking information live online. Orders some gear for Next Day delivery but when tracked it showed that the goods hadn't been collected. Contacted ASOS and was told the goods were Out for Delivery. I questioned this and was still told they would be delivered. Never showed and the goods weren't collected from ASOS until 15.28pm on the day they were supposed to be Delivered. Spoke to Customer service again to be told they cant do anything and would even admit they gave out incorrect info! Will never use ASOS again!!!!
"June 20, 2019",1,I have purchased with asos for years,I have purchased with asos for years. Never really having too many issues with them or postage or their customer service. I don't order too often (in fact only 3 times this year 2019 and we are 6 months into the year) SO NOT often. My recent purchase i ordered 3 items - which were sent. 2 of the items did not fit so within hours of receiving i lodged the return and sent it back immediately the next morning. This was 10 days ago. The returns are local and almost immediate usually. After enquiring I have had excuse after excuse. Even providing them with the return receipt of delivery. Their excuse is that its in another suburb 10 minutes away.  PATHETIC. Obviously they have a large volume of returns and issues with people wearing and returning - i literally lodged the return 2 hours after i received it - because i was at work. MY OTHE CONCERN is that none of the items sent to me had tags. I also wrote a note to state my concerns and that they looked worn.   Last time ill ever shop with them YUK.
"June 20, 2019",4,my package took way too long to arrive,"my package took way too long to arrive, and i purchased express shipping...customer service stated it had been delivered when in fact it had not, however the package did finally arrive and the items were great, so i give 4 stars"
"June 20, 2019",1,FRAUDS! THEY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY,"I wish I could give this company no stars. They're absolute frauds and scammers. I ordered an item over a month ago, which was supposed to be delivered this past Monday June 17th, the item never came. So I contacted their ""chat team"" only to have automated responses given back to me. A team member from the chat then advised me they would look into the matter and I would receive an email within 24 hours. That of course, didn't happen. So I contacted them again today June 19th only for another team member from their chat tell me they in fact did not even have my order and I was going to receive a refund! What?!?! So, on the 17th one person is telling me my order has been shipped and will arrive any day now, then on the 19th another person is telling me I'm being refunded?! SMELLS LIKE A SCAM! So I then asked for proof of a refund several times, only to be denied any email of any sort of proof that I will be refunded. I order online all the time and this is the only time something so shady has happened to me and I'm so angry! DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM HERE THEY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY!!!!"
"June 19, 2019",1,I have never had any issues with Asos‚Ä¶,"I have never had any issues with Asos until very recently. I have premier delivery so that I can chose when my parcels are delivered as I work full time. I recently managed to order a dress before it sold out and ordered it for next day delivery, a Sunday so I would be home for the package. Hermes didn‚Äôt attempt to deliver the package until Tuesday- once at 11am and once at 2pm. Not very clever for all of us who work. I altered the delivery to a neighbour but you can only chose one neighbour.. the one I chose also wasn‚Äôt in. Hermes only try three times and state this will usually be over three working days.. mine was two and the package was two days late. Sold out dress has been returned to Asos. I spoke to Asos customer services who were very unhelpful and super defensive. No apology- I couldn‚Äôt believe such a big brand has such poor customer care. It has really put me off shopping with them again."
"June 19, 2019",1,ASOS refused to give me a refund and blocked my account for apparent suspicious activity!!,"I ordered many products recently due to having a wedding and a two-day concert happening within a few weeks of each other. I find actually going out shopping quite stressful, therefore I purchase things online, try them on and send them back if I don‚Äôt like them or they are no good. I have never had issues with this until recently with ASOSI made a few purchases recently at ASOS, Boohoo, Misguided and New Look for recent events. ASOS offer payment through Klarna , which is amazing due to being able to try clothes on and pay for the ones you like within 28 days, therefore saves paying off your card and waiting for a refund if not liked. Due to events fast approaching and not finding an outfit I liked, I decided to make a large order with ASOS to try on things which I hadn‚Äôt thought of previously. I also ordered things in both an 8 and a 10 due to sizes varying and having the size required if I finally found something I liked. Anyway, I ended up spending ¬£399 and was sad to find that only a hat suited me out of the products I had purchased. I was fortunate enough to have liked items I had purchased from Boohoo on my card around the same time. I packaged my parcel up with everything barring the hat which I loved. I then attached the pre-printed labels and returned my parcel as I always do. I didn‚Äôt think anything of this until 19 days later I found on Klarna that I was still outstanding the full ASOS balance of ¬£399. Shocked at this, I contacted ASOS who stated they hadn‚Äôt received my return.  They requested proof of sending. I initially thought I had sent this on the 28th May due to having a tracking system on my phone which showed that I stopped off at the post office on this date. I was able to locate a post office return receipt from the 24th May to ASOS following upturning my house and sent this in a proof of return. I was then informed that I said I previously informed them it was the 28th May I returned. I informed staff that I had sent many things back recently, therefore was mistaken and have proof that my ASOS parcel was returned on 24th May and was received by their depot.  I was informed that this would have to be passed onto the customer care team and would receive a reply within the next 24 hours. Almost 36 hours later I was sent and email from the customer care team to which completely shocked me. ‚ÄúAfter an assessment of your account, we've made the decision to not issue a refund for the return of order 410563118. It‚Äôs very rare for returns to go missing and ASOS have therefore made the decision to not accept any further orders from you.  In order to take this further, we recommend contacting your payment provider to dispute any lost funds. Your payment provider may be in touch with ASOS and we'll be able to provide information regarding your account to support their investigations. Once they're happy this is a genuine claim, they may refund your account.  In the event further orders are placed, they'll be cancelled. As we‚Äôre unable to help you further with this, any emails received about this matter will be automatically closed down with no response‚Äù.So ASOS have apparently looked into my account and have suspected suspicious activity.  I have contacted various people from ASOS to which I have had people ignore me, put the phone down or basically make me feel like a criminal. Apparently, it is suspicious because I have made a few large purchases recently and sent most if not all of my order back due to not liking them. Having the option of Klarna, I have taken advantage of being able to make purchases and only pay for the ones I like and return the others without having to pay. Apparently, this is suspicious? Why I ask? Anyway, ASOS must think I still have my parcel despite informing them I don‚Äôt and have evidence of postage which confirmed they had received it. I am completely blocked from my ASOS account and will be unable to make any future orders (not that I would now) and have no way of discussing this case further with them.  I have made many orders with ASOS and have had no previous suspicious activity on my account. I have no criminal record. I have no bad reputation. I am a registered and respected mental health nurse working in the NHS. I have also never had any problems with any other shopping company. So it‚Äôs safe to say that I am absolutely shocked and appalled by the unprofessionalism and poor customer service that I have received from ASOS. I would be happy to remove my post should this be rectified by ASOS, however my opinion will always be negative of ASOS going forward should this not be resolved. I have also paid my ¬£10 delivery saver and would like this refunding due to being unable to take advantage of this in the future.  #ASOS #Klarna #Delivery #Return #Refund #Refused #Disbelieved #Judged #NoExplanation #Blocked #BlockedAccount #Notabletocontact #Sterotyping #Misjudged #PoorCustomerService"

It has been more than 4 days now and i tried to track my package and was chatting with girl name Amber. I told her that my package was supposed to be delivered on 17th june as i was eligible for express shipping. I mean that was the whole point i bought items more than $200. I will be going out of country on 24th and i needed my package before that, but she said she can't do anything and left the chat. i told her what happened why it didn't got delivered but she just left the chat."
"June 19, 2019",1,Final Straw,I placed an order online using next day delivery however there was an technical error with the checkout (on the companies side) meaning the paged refreshed before i could check out. I then successfully checked out and the order was paced using standard delivery. this wasn't good enough as i needed the order urgently. i then phoned and called to ask them to cancel the order however they disagreed and said we cant see who is at fault so the order wont be cancelled however this breaks the distance selling regulations for online orders. i emailed stating this and i received a very generic response. NOT HAPPY.
"June 19, 2019",1,DONT ORDER!!!!,"Delays, lying ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù, clothes gets sold out AFTER you have paid for it, and the it‚Äôs not sold out.. loooong delivery and returns.. almost just a scam company ...."

Very poor work ASOS - won't be shopping with you ever again POOR POOR POOR EFFORT!!!!!
"June 18, 2019",1,DO NOT ORDER FROM ASOS,"I recently ordered and returned clothes a few days after receiving them. It has been over a month and i have yet to receive my refund ot get a clear answer as to why i haven't received it. The worst customer service i have ever had. If you look closely at their website they do not give you a phone number to call for issues. I have went back and forth only on emails and live chats to no help  AT ALL! They do not care if you have any issues, unprofessional and not to mention their clothes are horrible quality. Do yourself a favor just order from anywhere else!"

One of them closed the chat before finishing the conversation and provided no solution.No Free Returns since the consumer can not find the courier store to return it to and get his refund."
"June 18, 2019",1,Don‚Äôt deserve even 1 star,Don‚Äôt deserve even 1 star. Took 2 weeks to deliver then returned for different size. Carrier lost the return  in the post and asos keep telling me to wait for it to be returned before a refund can be given! Worst customer service ever.
"June 18, 2019",1,Not being refunded for a brand new top they've received back!,"Returned two orders in one bag to save on packaging, posting etc. Admittedly (and in hindsight very mistakenly) from two different accounts - my one and my friend's one when she had to order something for me last minute and had Premier Next Day delivery to help me out. Put both returns slips in the package and posted back -  received a refund from one order but haven't for the other.Online chat was useless as the woman wrote that she ""can't help me with getting my money back and can't advise me any further"" just because I had returned orders from two accounts in one bag??Didn't even try asking what the other order number or postal tracking number was! Unwilling to look into it further, unwilling to refund me for my return and unwilling to send the item back to me since I've paid for it at the end of the day! So annoyed at this lack of customer care."
"June 18, 2019",1,Lost return parcel,I am disgusted with the service ASOS have provided!!!!!!!! After sending my parcel back for a return it has gone missing. The content of the parcel is ¬£140 I have contacted the customer service 5 times in which they a literally useless not providing any help or solution! I will never shop on ASOS again as from such a big online retailer you wouldn't expect this service!
"June 18, 2019",4,Overall good experience,"Overall good experienceI've been making orders on Asos every couple of months. Never had any delays or delivery problems with them.

"June 17, 2019",1,Knock knock who's there?,"Someone signed for me and clearly the hermes driver sent it to the wrong address. Now asos expects me to knock on the doors of all the neighbours in the street before they will take further action wth? Maybe don't use a useless courier like hermes. Past deliveries from asos have been with dpd which I've never had a problem with. Glad I used klarna, hopefully their buyer protection will cover me if my clothes don't show up because I'm not paying almost ¬£100 for a non-delivery!"
"June 17, 2019",1,"AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE, AWFUL SHIPPING, AWFUL EVERYTHING",My package was delivered to the wrong address and after chatting with multiple people about this I was told to close the chat because they cannot do anything about it.

"June 17, 2019",1,DO NOT ORDER,"I have been ordering from ASOS for years, but won‚Äôt be after this. I placed an order 25th of May and it was supposed to be here on or before 5th of June. I haven‚Äôt even received a shipping confirmation email yet.I have been in contact with them trough chat and they just tell me to wait (at first until 15th and now until 20th of June).I can‚Äôt get real answers, just copy & paste responses and I had to ask them 6 times before they told me my package hasn‚Äôt even been shipped yet (at first they tried to hide it by telling me to check if it has been delivered to my neighbors and that there are delays in the shipping) I have also emailed them and sent them a message on Facebook but they have ignored it"
"June 17, 2019",1,Bought a Paperdolls dress and a clutch‚Ä¶,"Bought a Paperdolls dress and a clutch handbag for a wedding. Was supposedly shipped on the 9th May to be delivered in Canada on the 31st. I had it shipped at the local post office since there have been reports of parcel thefts in our new neighborhood's FB page; it's the safest delivery option since it's it's a government instance.  I contacted them during the first week of June to ask for explaination, since there is no middle man for the delivery to my door (it basically leaves their warehouse, transits, go through custom, and transits to the post office; I have to go pick it up myself). Their customer service said ""we have to wait until the end of June"". I explained about the wedding and said I had no guarantee that they would still be available had I to buy another one; asked a few questions which all were answered without much useful information.  At the end, I was told ""can you go ahead and close this chat window so the conversation can be ended"". Wow. What a nice way to end contact. It's now the 17th of June and customs never take that long. So I guess, I will have to dash more money to get another dress as 1- I doubt there are anymore available on their website by now 2- I wouldn't take the chance to purchase it from there anymore and it's a bugger as I can't seem to find Paperdolls dresses anywhere else 3- according to other reviews, I won't be getting a refund anytime soon (they probably won't send me the merchandise again if it is still available). ""To hell the wedding you have to attend end"", that's how much they care. I am about to contact them again, not expecting much but oh yeah I will put up a fight. Sadly, no Paperdolls dress, no compensation for the trouble. I wished there was an internet police to investigate and hold companies like this accountable."

"June 17, 2019",1,ASOS has the worst policy and customer‚Ä¶,"ASOS has the worst policy and customer service. When they deliver faulty items it takes 3 to 4 weeks to admit through mail that the item received it is faulty even if you transmitted on their chat in the same day and it takes another 45 days to refund you the amount. Also in half of the times they don't respect the time delivery that they have give you on your order confirmation and even you tell them through their chat that you don't need anymore the items because of the delay and also because ASOS didn't announce the delay, they blocked your amount on something that you don't need anymore. Rubbish"
"June 17, 2019",1,Shocking Customer Service,"You have to retype your email address each time you place an order. If you make an error (e.g hitmail ) by mistake, your order won‚Äôt appear on your account and you won‚Äôt get an email. They then try to blame this on something going wrong with the transaction. It takes constant emails / messaging / chats before finally after 5 days they can tell you what actually happened. Then even though by this time you have gone off the boil and probably shopped elsewhere instead, it‚Äôs tough because its too late to cancel apparently! Then you make complaint about the customer service you‚Äôve received only to be told ‚Äú we don‚Äôt have a complaints department as we are all equally trained ‚Äú followed by ‚Äú if you have any questions please let me know‚Äù. Who ever trains these guys clearly has no knowledge on Customer Service."
"June 17, 2019",1,Disappointed,I placed an order on 10th with next day delivery and seven days later they didn‚Äôt even shipped yet! I don‚Äôt know what happened to them they used to be great..Do not order unless you can wait weeks.

I haven't received any of the items, they didn't allowed me to cancel the order even after admitting that they didn't shipped anything and don't know when they would be able to deliver the order.

Two weeks later she received an email stating they had had a technical glitch and the order had been cancelled. The money was charged, however. After making contact with the company, and speaking with Richard from ASOS, a refund on one of the dresses was made after much trouble, but the other was sent.When the dress arrived it did not fit, so a return label was ordered and the package was shipped the same day. Now almost three weeks after, still no refund of the second dress, they refuse to chat and require e-mails to be sent to them validating identity, despite doing so, it's still not sufficient, so we still chat (since they have no phones apparently) with ASOS, or that might too much to say, since they reject chatting and continue closing the chat whenever we refer to older chats and reference and order numbers and request a refund for the second dress...Chatting with two people named Jessie and Ellie were outright rude and not willing to do any type of customer care/service.I seriously don't comprehend how a company can exist with employees like that."

I recently bought a multipack of clothes from ASOS, after them being too large I sent them back and re-ordered the size smaller (XS) now unless you are 6ft or more, I wouldn‚Äôt bother ordering anything from their own brand. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and the first set of T-shirts ordered in size S reached my knees. The second set ordered in XS reach the middle of my thighs. These are not long line, they‚Äôre just basic T-shirts. The model is 6‚Äô6 wearing a medium and its long on him. Ridiculous sizing."
"June 16, 2019",4,A distinctive feature of Asos is a huge‚Ä¶,"A distinctive feature of Asos is a huge number of product lines and a huge mass of information under each product. Strict rule - under each product is indicated the growth of the model, the size of the thing on it, and besides the photo, you can watch the video! This is really great because the photos don`t always show the material, fitting, and the model of the thing. In addition, under each product, there is a dimensional table of a specific brand and specific things. Choosing on them, the chance to settle with the size will be minimal. The main thing is not to forget that you need to look at these tables! You can also enter your parameters and the site will automatically calculate the desired size according to the table."

I keep getting a scripted reply from each associate that I need to check with my neighbours and call my local post office to see if it is there.I called Canada post they literally told me without a tracking number they can do nothing. I contacted them back and they told me if it does not arrive by June 23 to get back to them. Told me they are an online company and no managers to speak to. I asked for someone to call me and they refused. At this point I am thinking my dress is not coming and going to be contacting my credit card company in hopes of a refund. I will never and I mean never order from this company again. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs happened but I‚Äôve ordered about two years ago and never had an issue. ASOS you really need to get your crap together because seriously customers is what will keep you in business. This is the worst customer service I have experienced in my entire life.
"June 16, 2019",1,Very bad experience with CC,Very bad experience with CCMy Premium delivery ran out and I wasn't made aware of that. Just made a ¬£230 order and had to pay ¬£5;95 for next day delivery. I got in touch with CC to cancel my order because I wanted to purchase Premium delivery and re book my order with no delivery fees. I wasn't able to cancel my order and was told I had to pay the delivery fees even if I wanted to purchase the Premium delivery. Spent 35 min on chat with CC to be told nothing could be done and no credit could be provided...... felt really stuck in the process and very disappointed by the experience with CC.

"June 15, 2019",1,refunds .... don‚Äôt hold your breath!,Takes an eternity for refunds to be processed even though you can track that the company have received the goods back. Current offerings is 10 working days for refund ... even if you can see via tracking that they‚Äôve had the goods for about a week!Last 3 occasions I‚Äôve waited 10 days then raised the question ‚Äò where is my money‚Äô .. I‚Äôm then told it‚Äôs been escalated to a specialist and then miraculously about an hr later I receive a paypal advise that the money has been refunded. What‚Äôs all that about.Sitting on customers money waiting for them to claim it is not how it works! Whether is a low value  order or not and the customer has followed your process and used the return methods offered within the timescales given then why do ASOS seem to disregard all their timescales and do what they want! Out of order is what it is ...get your staffing sorted ... your excuses are becoming lame and tiresome
"June 15, 2019",1,STOP!!!!,STOP!!!!Don't buy anything here...I bought some this for my wedding the 28/5 express delivery set to the next day.They withdraw my money 3/6. I have not received anything yet..Can't cancel it...Still waiting in limbo..They can't give me an straight up answer..
"June 15, 2019",1,Will never order from them again and‚Ä¶,Will never order from them again and would advice everyone else to do the same. Placed a large order worth ¬£175 which was never even sent! They continue to promise it will be sent but do not post it and refuse to give me a refund. The people working at the online chat are useless and on a few occasions they have just ended the conversation with me when I have demanded a refund. It has been 1 month since I placed my order with no hope of getting my money back and no communication. Before this happened I thought ASOS was a good company to buy from but they are not!! Please go elsewhere to buy your goods because if your package doesn't turn up don't expect any help or your money back -they are thieves!!
"June 15, 2019",1,You can tell a lot about a company from the way they treat their customers.,"If you want to place an order with ASOS you better hope you don‚Äôt have any problems, their customer service is abysmal and they genuinely don‚Äôt care. Had a gift card due to expire so used it to purchase an item which I ended up returning for a smaller size. The smaller size was still out of proportion and of poor quality so returned it for a refund. The gift card was added back to my account but have only just found out it expired only 2 weeks later?? When questioning expiry dates and terms and conditions I have not been listened to and the same statements have been made time and again without actually answering my questions. I will not be using them again and encourage others to do the same. I will also be exercising my rights under GDPR and having my details removed from their systems."
"June 15, 2019",5,I have to write this review as a first‚Ä¶,"I have to write this review as a first time customer, so my  experience was perfectItem arrived within 3 days (  Standard delivery ) clothing arrived all items as ordered, I will  certainly use this company againFull 5 stars"
"June 15, 2019",1,Terrible service,Terrible service. My order was expected to be delivered on the 5th of June and it still has not arrived. I have contacted ASOS 3 times trying to locate it (via email and live chat) and they have no idea where it is. I went out my way to contact the courier service who say they don‚Äôt know where the parcel is located in their depot and since my location isn‚Äôt high priority (rural Scotland) they will get in touch in a couple of days when they locate it. I have now moved address and I dread trying to organise the order to be redelivered as I already know this is going to be an issue for them. This order was over ¬£130‚Äôs and I am left here not knowing when or if I will even receive it.
"June 15, 2019",1,I ordered a dress for graduation on May‚Ä¶,"I ordered a dress for graduation on May 28 and the said item will be delivered on or before June 14, 2019.First of all No tracking number was provided.. I contacted the company and they will inform me to wait till July 4thOkay. REALLY????? July 4th? Almost a month and a week when they said it was shipped the day or 2 days after.I spent $157 on this dress. Now I have to spend money to buy another one.Disappointing,"
"June 14, 2019",1,Confirmed as delivered however items not actually delivered....,Yet again I‚Äôve ordered a few things from ASOS and yet again they have been confirmed as delivered however I haven‚Äôt received my items.  This is the second time this has happened. This is terrible service and takes ages for anything to get resolved. Not a happy customer!
"June 14, 2019",1,Awful Delivery Service,"Awful service yet again, I have ordered two sets of items over the past few weeks. The first didn't get delivered because they couldn't find my home address. The second order I sent to my work address..... oh and they also returned it to the sender because they couldn't find the address and this time they charged me ¬£3 delivery for the pleasure. How much money must these guys be losing through poor delivery service?"
"June 14, 2019",1,Customer Service Non Existent,"Paid for express shipping for an item to ensure I received it before I left on an overseas trip. It was already late by the day I was going overseas so I contacted their ""customer service"" team to try and organise a return or cancel the delivery as I wouldn't be home within their return period. First person was difficult to deal with so I asked him to transfer me to someone else, which he refused saying ""you will get the same answer from them"". He then cancelled the chat while I was still talking, so I tried again and placed a complaint, second person was slightly more reasonable, but due to ASOS' stupid customer service policy she was useless too. After sending in a complaint, I received an email from customer service (not even manager) saying that they stand by the first persons decision to not transfer me. I don't give a duck if they tell me the same thing, I should be able to speak to another person if the person I'm talking to is dealing with the situation unsatisfactorily without being obstructed. After years of buying from ASOS, I will be boycotting them."
"June 14, 2019",1,The worst online shopping experience ever,"Ordered 3 dresses on 2nd June, paid ¬£200. Waited for 14 days to find out that my order has been refunded. They don't know the reason and I will have to wait for my money back until 26th June.Had to rush to other shops for last minute purchases for my very own baby shower. Majorly disappointed, customer service was dreadful, will never order from them again."
"June 14, 2019",1,Awful service,"Awful service, parcel never delivered as for some reason my parcel was returned by Hermes.  ASOS then advised they would not be able to fulfil my order and I would have to wait up to 11 days for a refund. First and last time using ASOS.  I should have known when I realised they used Hermes of all the delivery companies they are the worst in my experience."
"June 14, 2019",1,Still waiting for them to confirm a return,Still waiting for them to confirm a return even though had confirmation that this was successfully delivered on Tuesday 11/06/2019.The reason i had to return the items in the first place was because the parcel arrived 2 days late after paying next day delivery and had to go and buy all the stuff again as it was needed for a christening ! I have had to pay out double and now need that money back to see me through the rest of the month.Last time i made a big return of stuff it went missing and it took weeks and weeks of emails for them to refund MY money !The customer service is shocking i now have to wait 5 days to find out that my return has indeed gone missing and then will have to spend my time trying to get money back that belongs to me !!I am a very loyal customer and have spent thousands with asos they really have gone to pot !
"June 14, 2019",1,This company has lost its way.  Extremely poor customer service.,"I have shopped with ASOS for many years and have loved it. I loved it so much I purchased ASOS Premiere Delivery.  This was fine until the last couple of orders.  I found that I was no longer able to select next day free delivery despite my account details indicating that this was still active on my account.  I contacted ASOS on numerous occasions and eventually, I was advised that the 'Technical Team' had looked into my account and had decided to deactivate my Premiere Delivery.  They did refund the full purchase amount but this is not what I wanted.  I wanted to be able to use my Premiere Delivery.  I asked for an explanation but might as well have been talking to myself.  I did not get an explanation, only an invitation to re-purchase Premiere Delivery.  I don't think so!  I have now written to ASOS and requested that my account be closed.  I will not be buying from this company in future which is a shame because I have always loved doing so.  This company appears to have changed completely over the years I have been buying from them.  I may not be their intended target group but there was always something for everyone.  I am at an age where I have money to spend so more fool them."
"June 14, 2019",1,ASOS claiming return order wasn‚Äôt delivered,"Order a big number of dresses to try on for a wedding. Most of them were too big (used their sizing tool). Posted the parcel to return on Fridays and on Thursday I emailed ASOS asking if they received it. They denied it and I thought I lost my proof of postage so I was screwed. The next day I managed to find my proof of postage, tracked my ordered and it say it was delivered on Monday! Like really ASOS?"
"June 14, 2019",1,Order never showed up - worst customer service I've ever experienced,"I placed an order on May 18th - two maternity dresses for my baby shower on June 15th. I was going to pay for express shipping, but the regular shipping said it would be received ""on or before June 5th"" so I figured it would be okay. Of course the order hasn't shown up (it's now June 13th), and ASOS refuses to look into it until ""end of day June 26th"". Absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced."
"June 14, 2019",1,I placed an order more than a month ago‚Ä¶,"I placed an order more than a month ago and aid for expedited delivery. Not only I did not receive it but they say they did the delivery in a very weird address that does not even exist however, with the ""wrong delivery"" information they were able to process my credit card. Really? They don't even want to send me my purchase after all the back and forth or return my money. :((( Will never buy from here again."
"June 13, 2019",1,Watch out for so called promotions!,"So I ordered with a 20% code which was a 2 day promotion. Kept more than ¬£100 from both orders made the return and realised they now aren‚Äôt honouring the 20% off staying this is in the ‚Äòhelp pages‚Äô that unless I kept ¬£100 it was invalid. Even though I did spend over ¬£100. Appalling customer service this isn‚Äôt the first time they‚Äôve messed up. I‚Äôve had the wrong items sent to me, returns go missing, delayed refunds and items not being shipped on time even though I pay premium. Absolutely disgusting!"
"June 13, 2019",5,I order from ASOS all the time,"I order from ASOS all the time, often several times per month. Items always arrive when they say they will, if not before and 95% of the time are good quality  - as good, if not even better than expected. I was very shocked to read the other reviews because I have used ASOS in the UK, London and Manchester and from 3 towns in Spain, one very remote, and never had any problems whatsoever!"
"June 13, 2019",5,Never had a problem,"Always had a good experience with Asos whether it be orders, delivery or returns.  The only slight niggle is that they don't allow item reviews on their website. Happy with most of their service though."
"June 13, 2019",1,They are terrible,"They are terrible, after 2 and a half weeks my order still hasn't been shipped and they just keep sending automatic useless answers. One person told me that my order has been dellivered, the other one that it still hasn't been shipped. They closed the chat telling me that they already gave me all the informations they could. I would really not reccomand anyone buying from them EVER AGAIN because you'll be without your order and without your money."
"June 13, 2019",1,It should be referred to trade‚Ä¶,"It should be referred to trade descriptions as they should not be allowed to call themselves Customer Care. We ended up paying twice for 1 order as they told us to reorder and they would credit. But after 15 days, 3 lengthy internet chats and 14 emails we are still receiving standard responses, being passed from pillar to post and with no resolution in site. OK company if things run smoothly but a nightmare if any issues."
"June 13, 2019",4,I order here pretty often,"I order here pretty often, everything was okCheap stuff, quick delivery"
"June 13, 2019",1,Had better service from PPI cold callers......,"It appears i am not the only one who has been unlucky enough to suffer from taking my custom to this company. My first order with Asos as i don't really like much of what they sell however found some really nice Kurt Geiger tassle loafers which i thought would be good for my holiday.I placed the order for this ONE item, mens loafers, with next working day delivery and what arrived was a bag, no box, with some type of footwear inside. After opening the bag i found glittery womans sandals inside, ridiculous.I contacted ASOS via Facebook messenger after waiting 30 minutes on their live chat with no response. I did initially receive a personalised response asking for my name and email, I requested the correct shoes be resent next working day as i needed them for my holiday and received a generic repose asking em to return the shoes and to pay for the delivery of the return myself. The abolsute worst service i have had in years and i order form many, many online retailers, these lot are cowboys and you can find all of their branded products elsewhere."
"June 13, 2019",1,If I could rate them 0 I would,If I could rate them 0 I would. Made my order on the 28th of May using premium delivery which I paid for. Order never showed. Today is the 13 June weres my refund after I was granted my refund by the 11th June. Why am I been told the parcel is out for delivery today. WHAT THE F**** KIND OF COMPANY ID THIS.
"June 13, 2019",1,Worst customer service of all time,"I've now experienced the worst customer service of all time from this awful company. They don't give a **** about you as a customer. They don't answer emails, they refuse to take responsibility and try to hand you over to someone else and so on.I placed an order last Saturday, with a worth of almost 500¬£. It was urgent for me (my girlfriend) to get it delivered fast since she really needed some of the items in the order on a banquette the following Wednesday. So, they had at least 3 working days to deliver. To really make sure we would get it in time, I bought an extra service that would guarantee delivery the next working day - in this case, the Monday. Now its Thursday and I still haven't received the package. And I don't know at all when I can expect it since I'm given no information at all.  That's not the worst part.  The customer service and the way they handle this situation is. Go spend your money somewhere else, is my advise.."
"June 13, 2019",1,Terrible customer service and delivery,"Something happened rob ASOS, I was a client for 7 years, but last several order is like a disaster , and everything is about customer service. They are not helping at all, they even are rude. My order was not dispatched for 2 weeks, no information, no apologies. Actually I even did not need it anymore, however they send it to me with lack of one item ( I was making order because of this item) their answers are terrible, service terrible. Already decide not to use it anymore!"
"June 13, 2019",1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"Now running a scam business ripping off customers and stealing money. The were once great, I can't believe how badly they've fallen. Customer service is the worst I've ever experienced. Unless non deliveries, not being refunded and being spoken to rudely is your thing, AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This is not the company it once was."
"June 13, 2019",1,SO BAD DO NOT SHOP HERE,"SO BAD DO NOT SHOP HERE. I placed an order on APRIL 7TH for $200 using afterpay to pay. I paid my first $50 payment and my afterpay payment schedule was set up, but never received an order confirmation from asos. I emailed their customer service immediatley and they told me they cannot find my order in their system (even though i sent through proof of my afterpay payments to them and upcoming payments) and essentially there is nothing they can do. I was then back and forth in contact with them for THREE MONTHS and they never found a resolution for me. I have paid them $200 and never received my order. Their customer service is terrible and i have been robbed. never shopping here again"
"June 12, 2019",1,Do not order from this business,"I just purchased a dress three weeks ago from ASOS and it took them almost 2 weeks to ship and deliver it. When I got the dress it smelled like someone had worn it for a while and then returned it. I immediately shipped it back but was only given a partial refund. I contacted customer service through an online chat to tell them about what had happened but was asked if I had taken any pictures. I don‚Äôt know how you would be able to take pictures of that lol. The person I talked to regarding this was Janine and not only did the process take 24 minutes (she took a long time to respond) but she was also rude. I do most of my shopping online and I have never dealt with customer service this horrible. Do not purchase anything from this store, not only do they cheat their customers but they also don‚Äôt value them. The clothes are ill-fitted and not very original; you can find most of the same styles elsewhere. Save your money and purchase from a company where you matter."
"June 12, 2019",1,Terrible experience,"Terrible experience. I was at home specifically to take my order but I never heard anything. Only got one text about my order time but no texts since. Contacted their live chat to try and get answers and after 17 minutes I managed to get 0 apology, nobody listened to my question, and ended with ‚Äòif there‚Äôs nothing else close the chat‚Äô. So rude. Clearly don‚Äôt value their customers no matter how many times they shop. I‚Äôm deleting the app and will not shop with them again."
"June 12, 2019",1,Order not shipped and horrible customer service,"Seriously, what happened to Asos? I have been a customer for years, but never experienced something like this. My order was placed on the 25th of May and was supposed to arrive on the 1st of June. However, it never arrived. It seems that Asos didn't even ship the package. Now, more than two weeks later, the package is still not shipped. I've tried contacting the customer service several times, but they fail to provide me with a proper response. Instead, I receive standard answers and contradictory messages. Plus, they take more than a week to reply. The customer service is truly a joke. Absolutely horrible. Until they fix whatever problems they have, I won't shop with them again."
"June 12, 2019",1,Customer service is SHOCKING,"Clothes from Asos are great, not the problem. However there customer service is ridiculous. I‚Äôve waited over a week for my order, due date is today and I received the tracking information. To then find out my parcel has been sent back to them within the hour of them sending it... due to a damaged package. I doubt that very much. I emailed them to resolve my problem. They told me to reorder the items, although one of the two items is out of stock. They didn‚Äôt care, I asked for a discount/ free delivery because this was a hassle for me. Again no help, the lady said to me, if you look on Facebook you‚Äôll find one there. And I have to wait 7 days for a refund from a package I never received.  I don‚Äôt think so. Asos, I hope you read this. Your customer service is absolutely ridiculous and this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve had ridiculous service from you."
"June 12, 2019",3,Love the delivery option I paid for the‚Ä¶,Love the delivery option I paid for the year its so easy and quick. Just slightly gutted you removed the points/reward system last year. You did say that something was going to put into place instead on the email I received but I didn't get anything. Will you introduce something in the future?
"June 12, 2019",1,2 incorrect sizes & no refund as of yet,"I was send the incorrect size shoe when I initially ordered, they told me to send it back and reorder. Stupidly I did and they sent me the wrong size again. I have now been trying to get my money back for nearly two weeks, customer service are horrendous. Avoid Asos if you can!"
"June 12, 2019",1,Beware of ASOS Refund Rip off if using‚Ä¶,"Beware of ASOS Refund Rip off if using a discount code..I purchased two dresses the same but different sizes, each dress was ¬£90.00 non discounted and ¬£75.00 with a discount code.If I had purchased one dress the cost would also have been ¬£75.00But if you return an item ASOS take all the discount off the returned item so you get a refund of the amount paid minus ALLl the discount and you are expected to pay the FULL non discounted price on the item you kept.  Best thing to do is order both items separately if you are expecting to return an item, or better still order else where."
"June 12, 2019",1,Customer service absolutely HORRENDOUS,"If I could give asos customer service 0 stars, I would. After years of buying from this website I am now going to have to stop buying from here. Not only did 6 items from my order not arrive, but after over 2 weeks of communicating with the asos team via facebook, they still have not given me a refund. They respond with a robotised answer of ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience"" and ""We've been busier than usual"" FOR 2.WEEKS. STRAIGHT. As a loyal customer, I am extremely disappointed and I advice anyone considering making a purchase from asos to think twice as if there's a problem with the order they will disregard you COMPLETELY."
"June 12, 2019",1,I have been a very good and very loyal‚Ä¶,"For 8 years I have been a very good and very loyal Asos' customer: in fact, pretty everything I was buying was coming from their website. Troubles were rare and I had full satisfaction about this e-seller that I was using on a really regular basis (often monthly) and that I was recommending to everyone around me.However, these last years Asos' quality has started to lower and lower on several levels: first on quality products, then on prices and promotion codes (which don't even exist anymore), on deliveries efficiency and finally, on customer service effectiveness. This is the first time of my life that I write an online review.My last order was a huge joke. Not only it arrived super late (2 weeks after ordering), not only they didn't warn me about this delay, not only they didn't inform about 2 products being out of stock and going to miss in the parcel, not only they took my money way before shipment (including the cost of the 2 missing items),  but their customer service happened to be a complete nonsense, totally disrespectful as well as useless: 2 ways of reaching them: 1- Email (nobody answers) 2- Tchat' (automatic-bot agents unable to help who'll close the window if you're not okay with their absurd answers). I am very disappointed. This is not just about orders being ""less"" satisfying but being really awful, a big waste of time, money and nerves, when we exactly use e-shop to save time, money and nerve... After around 5 tchat's and 4 emails trying to fix it, I'm still waiting for the rest of my products, my due refund, not speaking about a fair compensation. I'm done. This was my very last Asos order and I hope that all customers will find various ways to express their genuine discontent.This is not a way to treat people you take money from, people you call ""clients""."
"June 12, 2019",1,NEVER SHOP ON ASOS AGAIN! my awful story,"This site doesn‚Äôt even deserve 1 star! The customer policy is extremely bad! I‚Äôve been ordering items on ASOS since some years ago. But roughly one year ago something has changed and every single order I was buying came wrong to me. Twice I‚Äôve been getting absolutely wrong sizes, simply it wasn‚Äôt the size I‚Äôve ordered. Once I‚Äôve ordered 38 sized leggings, ASOS sent me 34!!! Then I‚Äôve ordered T-shirt for my boyfriend in size L, they‚Äôve sent me M. The final and worst case is I‚Äôve ordered puma sandals for kinda big price and the item I‚Äôve got was absolutely different, DIDNT MATCH the description at all and costed 1/3 less on other websites. I‚Äôve been trying to get partial refund, but the only thing ASOS did was telling me this is not stated in their policy. Bye, ASOS. I do not recommend this to anyone! Never shop with ASOS, guys!"
"June 12, 2019",1,What a joke...... Never shop with this company again,Sent an exchange item back to ASOS on Sunday 2nd JuneDPD told me my exchange would be delivered on Sunday 9th June.No parcel arrived.Called Customer Services on Monday 10th June and was told to collect my parcel from the DPD depot.Waited 30 minutes for someone to serve me at DPD depot to be told my parcel was on the way back to ASOS.called Customer Services again to be told that they did not know what had happened and I would have to re-order my goods and would get a refund which would take up to 10 days to hit my account.I complained further and was told a Customer Service manager would call me back within 24 hours ( still waiting 40 hours on... ).
"June 12, 2019",1,Please believe me when I say all Asos care about is your money.,"Yes, Asos may entice you with decent prices for decent products but please believe me when I say all they care about is your money. Their aftercare is honestly disgusting. Every time I have had an issue with Asos it hasn‚Äôt been resolved. The most recent - blatant refusal to refund an item OR EVEN RETURN IT TO ME after what can only be described as a dishonest attempt to cover it up. No confirmation email (even though my girlfriend and I returned some 10 items, all but 1 had refund confirmation), I had to provide proof of postage (which luckily I kept), the first 2 asos reps I spoke to even said my refund would be in my account in 5-10 working days! 3 weeks later, no refund, Asos are even refusing to return the item to me. I thought we had a contract and entered into it in good faith, looks like the feeling wasn‚Äôt mutual.Seriously it‚Äôs daylight robbery. I have no idea how they are still operating and making money, it‚Äôs disgusting."
"June 12, 2019",1,Bad customer services,the customer service in live chat is super rube. they cant do any thing to help me track my parcel and even tell me to close the chat. supper useless
"June 12, 2019",1,If I could give no stars I would,"If I could give no stars I would. My daughter received the wrong order no responses to her follow up enquiries, just excuses nd no offer of a refund, a new order or even an explanation. They simply fob people off and take their money. They are hopeless. With so many better shops to order from just dont use these shonks. They are the worst of the worst."
"June 12, 2019",1,DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE,"asos has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. they sent me the completely wrong pair of bikini bottoms as part of my order and will not do anything about it even though it is of no fault on my part. the rep said to just sent them back and I would be refunded for their amount BUT return shipping costs $22.40 and I already paid nearly $60 in duties, as well as express shipping, losing me close to $100 for something that is not even what I ordered. absolutely trash website/company with sales representatives who are rude and extremely unhelpful. I would not recommend to anyone."
"June 11, 2019",1,Live chat customer service?,Live chat customer service?! Don‚Äôt even bother most useless tool ever if you can‚Äôt help anyone. Email? Don‚Äôt bother with that either they just ignore you. Won‚Äôt be ordering again
"June 11, 2019",1,"Worst service ever! 3 weeks, and I still haven't recieved my package","Usually, I love Asos, but their customer service is so bad!!! I ordered two pair of jeans 3 weeks ago. It was supposed to arrive at the 3rd of June, but it did not. Then I emailed Asos, where their response was ""Wait until the 9th"". on the 9th I emailed them again saying my parcel had still not arrived. Now they want me to wait until the 17th... And the worst part is that they only send me those automatic answers... I keep saying I just want to know where my jeans are, but they just want me to wait another week... This is such a bad experience!!!"

"June 11, 2019",1,The most incompetent customer service in the world,"My partner has been a loyal customer of ASOS for years. Up until now, everything was okay. In the last order, he received a completely different item. This might happen. There was a return label so we have returned the item. There has been no reaction, no refund, no e-mail for about a month.We have sent several e-mail to the customer service, we have never got any response. We have tried the chat several times. After having waited for an hour, we finally could talk to someone. We always got the same copy-paste response. I have never been this furious. Having googled the CEO's e-mail address, I have sent a complaint.Guess what? The mail has been transferred to the customer service and I got, once again, a copy-paste response that didn't answer my question at all. Shame on you, ASOS. This is the worst customer service I have ever encountered.I'd rather shred my money or burn it than buy anything from you ever again."
"June 11, 2019",1,WHERE IS ASOS‚ÄôS CUSTOMER SERVICE.....,"WHERE IS ASOS‚ÄôS CUSTOMER SERVICE....................I have been a loyal customer with ASOS for years, as they have lovely clothes and great prices.HOWEVER, on the one and only time I have had the unfortunate displeasure in contacting ASOS, due to an order that had suddenly midway in delivery been returned to ASOS, without the delivery company attempting delivery, with no explanation, and I had to contact both ASOS chat and email them to find out why. Unfortunately, I was met with un apologetic, in-personable and generic scripted responses, stating sorry  if my order/parcel was being sent back to ASOS , it could be due to being damaged or no one being in, and a full refund would occur in 5-10 days once they had received the parcel, and THEY could not resend the items ordered due to SECURITY REASONS. If I wanted to order again, as I had commented I had to wait for a refund, to use Klarna .......So they offered no help to contact the delivery company to establish why my order was being returned just a blunt unhelpful statement that  the parcel was being returned  for some unknown reason, and once they have received it they would then  process it, and I would receive a refund in 5-10 days........  ASOS CUSTOMER SERVICES , WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.3 days later I receive a bashed up parcel which was sloppily taped in the delivery companies tape, and box open and damaged, containing a partial order with no invoice.I then had to contact ASOS email again to find out why I have received a partial order in a bashed up and ripped open box, when on 2 occasions ASOS customer services told me that it was being returned to them, not aware of why, and I would be receiving a full refund, and they would be unable to resend my original order out.Yet again I was met with lack lustre generic email and apology, with a refund for the item that was missing, but no explanation  why I‚Äôve received a partial order in a damaged delivery box when THEY stated I wouldn‚Äôt be receiving the items.After several emails with generic responses of ASOS customer services taking no responsibility, and implying it was the delivery companies fault and not answering my questions on why my order and delivery was such a shambles, where at one moment I wasn‚Äôt receiving it I would be getting a refund, to 3 days later receiving a partial order in a bashed and damaged box, and myself informing them of this and that a item was missing with no explanation or acknowledgement of the stress and frustration of myself having to chase the status of the order over 6-7 emails in total, over 4 days in total. ASOS took no responsibility, none whatsoever, and no personable sincere apology was received apart from there generic responses. Other online companies have bent over backwards when there has been a problem with one of my deliveries, they have contacted and kept me informed of the situation after I initially contacted them, and I‚Äôve felt like a person and valued customer, and I‚Äôve been offered sincere apologies and vouchers for the inconvenience.UNFORTUNATELY NOT WITH ASOS, THEY OFFER GENERIC SCRIPTED RESPONSES, ACKNOWLEDGING NO RESPONSIBILITY OR CUSTOMER SERVICE. THE CUSTOMER HAS TO DO ALL THE CHASING, WITH NO SINCERE APOLOGY OR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THIS.ASOS YOU NEED TO REVIEW YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE POLICY AND RHETORIC, AS YOU HAVE NONE. THIS CAN ALSO BE MIRRORED BY OTHER CUSTOMERS REVIEWS ALSO. ASOS. You need to treat your so called valued customers as VALUED......"
"June 11, 2019",1,No reply for over a week,"I have been shopping with ASOS for years, I really like their clothes and I've never had a problem with them up until a week ago. I have had Premier Delivery for about 3 years and always renew it in March when it expires. This year was no different. A few Sundays ago I went to buy an outfit for the following Saturday. I saw that Next Day Delivery wasn't an option for me and Premier Delivery wasn't showing on my Account. I emailed ASOS and it took 2 days to get a reply back to tell me to clear my cookies which should fix the problem. That obviously wasn't the issue as it was happening on their iOS app but I did it anyway and tried again but to no avail. I responding to the agent with screenshots of the order when I bought it and they told me that they were transferring me to another team to investigate. It's now been over a week and I've heard nothing from them. I am appalled that a company like ASOS would treat it's customers so badly. I really like shopping with them so I hope they resolve this issue soon and improve their Customer Service experience."

Worst ever fix up asos before your left with no customers at all sadly
"June 11, 2019",1,"Brainless ""customer service"" advisors let the company down","Loyal ASOS customer for years, not had may problems really until it comes down to needing to talk to someone. Once their delivery driver allegedly attempted delivery 3 times however left no card or a blank card so I was unable to rearrange delivery for a suitable time. After getting nowhere with online chat, the order got returned to the warehouse even though I needed it, and I had to reorder. Waste of both of our time! Now, I have 2 orders, standard delivery. When I checked why they haven't arrived, website is telling me it will take 10 days because they are busy! Not acceptable. It did not say this when I ordered. I even purchased the premier delivery with the second order and got free delivery (which has to be over ¬£25 to qualify) however the order only amounted to ¬£21.95. So I'm struggling to understand why it has been processed with standard delivery for free, rather than the premier that I purchased!! Tried online chat again (for some reason!) and was met with a completely snooty and blunt advisor who did nothing for me, other than tell me the order will arrive in 10 days and I don't have the option to cancel. Then asked what else they can do to help?! I said you haven't helped me at all so far.. then they ended the chat!! Laughable! AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE AND NOWHERE TO COMPLAIN PROPERLY.They are definitely going down hill. On the plus side, if you need a job that requires zero skills whatsoever (or a brain!) and pays you to do absolutely nothing of value - ASOS online customer service could be right up your street!"

I had purchased one-year Premier Shipping for $15, and when I purchased my clothing order, it said ""Premier Shipping Active"" in the checkout. When I received any order confirmation however, the delivery date was with standard delivery. I reached out to ASOS through chat (because, annoyingly, they do not have a phone number) and received absolutely no help at all. I waited up to TWENTY MINUTES for a response at times, and at other times the customer service agent literally answered a question of mine by copying and pasting a line from the ASOS website. The rep said that he was ""transferring my query to a team of specialists""---aka passing the baton and trying to get rid of me--and could not give me any timeframe as to when they would contact me. When I became frustrated, the customer service rep ENDED THE CHAT. Completely unacceptable customer service. I spend a lot of money on their website, and I expected better than this; they treated me like an annoyance, and didn't help solve my problem due to their horrible customer service."
"June 10, 2019",1,No packing slip or order confirmation makes return impossible,"1. I placed an order and paid with PayPal.2. PayPal sent confirmation of my order.  ASOS did not.3. 1st support representative with whom I chatted (literally - as there is no phone support) told me that I did not receive a conformation email because the order did not truly go through.  There was a breakdown in order transmission from PayPal to ASOS and I guess I was to believe that my order had been cancelled...?4.  I was on the fence about size, so I ordered a different size of the same item from a different site.5.  Lo and Behold!  I received the item I ordered from ASOS.  I also received the item from the other vendor.  Order from Other Vendor fits.  Item ordered from ASOS does not.Now, that I've prefaced the situation.....I need to return the item ordered from ASOS.  Two things are required to make a return.a) an order #b) a Returns Note (aka a packing slip, a reason for the return, etc.)c) a shipping labelRegarding the 1st:  I was to have gotten ""a)"" when I placed the order.  (It took chatting with a 2nd support rep for :15 to determine that I had miskeyed my email address.  But she could not change it, resend the confirmation email, or even TELL me what my order # was)Regarding the 2nd and the 3rd:  Both items were to have been included in my received order.  Neither of them were.SHORTER VERSION:  I have spent 60 minutes chatting with 3 different representatives and can not get what I need to make a return.  I give up.  All I can do now is learn from the experience and NEVER ORDER FROM ASOS AGAIN."

Offered to keep the shoes if they would discount them for me and was told this was not an option by Kevin through Live Chat  (even though the shoes will be unsellable to any other customer).

The lengths and sizes are wrong (skirts/trousers have all been longer than mentioned) and the fabric is different to the photos, or they're just awful photos that don't show the textures on the fabric.Colours are also often different as well, or patterns look very different. Returns take longer than they say they should, even after Asos receive the order. Overall a very bad service, wouldn't recommend."

I contacted customer services as I thought that a discount was warranted, because the top seemed to have been worn and smelt badly. I didnt think that it was fair to pay full price, but ASOS offered absolutely nothing. Firstly, I question how thoroughly they check returns, this top really stank.

Ordered next day delivery to be told it was delayed by 2 days. Then 3 then 4. DHL declined my offer to collect and added 2 extra days making my order now 6 days late. Numerous chat and emails and ASOS declined a replacement order even though their courier had their goods they insisted it still had to be investigated. They finally told DHL to return parcel to them and informed me I had 7 days to wait for its return then up to 10 days for a refund. Awful customer service and will have retained my money and goods for 23 days and seem to think that‚Äôs a great help. Deserve to go into administration
"June 07, 2019",2,Poor delivery service,"My rating is related to the company that Asos partners up to deliver their packages here in NL. I think the issue is more in the shoulders of the company (PDP) but since Asos partners w them, I think it is only fair to share the blame. PDP has sent me bunch of delivery emails for my recent order w Asos, only to attempt to deliver at completely different date and time slot. Thankfully as I was keeping an eye on the delivery via track and trace, I was able to suggest change to deliver the order to a pick up location instead. They accepted this suggestion. I have left work early to pick up my parcel at this pick up location, only to get a message ( as I arrived) that they changed the delivery location to another location. Which was closing as I was receiving that message. I feel that the shipment market is absolutely in a need of innovation and some regulation as this is insane. They behave as if nothing mattered to them. We as customers have no say, nothing ever changes based on our feedback, because they are a necessary evil with low competition. Just so frustrating! Wish Asos offered variety of delivery companies options so that I did not have to repeatedly deal with DPD service."

"June 06, 2019",1,Baffling experience,"I made an order of 4-5 items which ended up being over 100 pound. Amazing! I am applicable for 20% off. Not quite, one of the shirts was too big, not trusting ASOS' exchange would be here in time before I went on holiday I ordered the medium instead on the same day hours after trying on the original shirt. The shirt was originally 25 pound so 20 pound after applying the discount, I really wanted the shirt so accepted I would have to pay full price for the correct size one. Later on holiday I received an email saying I had been refunded.... wait for it.... 1.80, yes 1.80 for a 25 pound shirt. I was expecting 20 pound as any normal human with a half working brain would. So I went to the livechat (waiting forever I should add), explained the situation, *keep in mind I had bought the exact same shirt and given them more money on the day of receiving my order* and was told because the refund took me under the 100 pound I wasn't entitled to the discount. At this point I looked at the screen and thought 'you must be joking'. Any normal company could see I bought the same shirt and would at least give me 20 pound if not maybe more for the hassle, NOT ASOS! I was told I could of exchanged the shirt and then this wouldn't of been the case, even though I have essentially done that myself whilst giving them more money and explained an exchange would take too long. I personally asked the person on the chat how she would feel in my position, ""I'm not aloud to give my opinion"", thank you for that you have made me feel like this is personal experience and I'm not talking to a robot (obvious sarcasm).Eventually she suggested I should refund the new shirt that fits me hence why I bought it, I said the tags were off and she said I therefore couldn't refund it. These were her only two solutions? Finally she had the nerve to copy and paste the refund policy to which she had already told me I wasn't entitled too and left the chat herself whilst I was typing, lovely experience isn't it? The company have essentially stolen my money at this stage, 1.80 for a shirt, if I took both receipts in to any shop they would sort it out there and then. This experience was baffling and quite frankly a disgusting way to treat a customer that has made multiple and frequent orders from them.Advice: DO NOT SHOP HERE even with  90% discount, customer service is the lowest I've seen in my 23 years alive."

So now I have 2 shirts for the price of 3 !Complete imbeciles ! Written it off now as a bad mistake never to be repeated - be warned."
"June 05, 2019",1,ASOS used to be a great place to shop - NOT ANYMORE!,Worst Customer experience I have had! Quite sad since I loved ASOS but something has gone horribly downhill this year! Next day delivery keeps getting postponed and no accountability whatsoever!! Copy/paste responses 'wait till end of day tomorrow' and then rudely close their customer service chats when they can't be bothered anymore. Won't be shopping there again!
"June 05, 2019",1,"Appalling, Waste of resource and money","I physically do not understand why ASOS employ customer service.If I managed any of these teams I'd be ashamed. As a customer I shouldn't have to coach them into apologising or trying to resolve the issue, even worse I shouldn't have to suggest ways in which they might try to resolve a problem, even if they won't. If all these staff are trained to do is copy and paste policies from the website they are a wasted resource and money. Appalling when you consider the customer base and turnover. Feel free to listen to my call recording, id hope someone with some common sense would to try and one day improve this shambolic excuse for customer service. I'm not mad because of the outcome, I'm disappointed in the whole experience."
"June 05, 2019",1,Warning !,"Update : received correct refund but only after I had to ring few times . I would still urge people to check refunds carefully Warning !! Check any refunds from ASOS !!I am a loyal customer of Asos and order regularly. I ordered almost ¬£400 worth of stuff last month as they were running a special 25% for students. It is the company‚Äôs policy not to give discount on items already for sale which is fair enough . I returned an item and found that Asos had taken 25% off my refund ! It was never 25% off as it was already on sale !I have been trying to get help on live chat , twitter and email  with no joy This could be happening to other customers so make sure you check what they refund you Is correct I hope that it was honest mistake! Really has left a bad taste in mouth and put me off ordering from them again particularly since you cannot get assistance from customer service."

It took a hour to tell me that I should ask my neighbors because I wasn't at home at the date of delivery -it is a lie- and I should wait for the next day. Next day I wrote them I want to cancel my order and don't make me look dumb because I know they haven't send my order and I want my money back. They told me they can't cancel it and I can't get my money back, just wait for the next day and he ended the chat..What a liar band...Never ever order from them anything..."

"June 05, 2019",1,This company is going down the pan,"I have no idea what‚Äôs happened at ASOS, but they used to be my go to company for clothes because of their massive selection, delivery options, speed of delivery and easy returns.Of the last 5 orders I‚Äôve placed, 1 never ever arrived, 1 arrived within 3 days although I‚Äôd paid for next day delivery, and I have been waiting 2 weeks for one. When I went online to get some help regarding this, I see a message explaining that they are ‚Äúvery busy‚Äù, so the delivery will be a week later than expected... what?! In what world is that acceptable, and are they actually informing customers who have orders in the system or just hoping that they‚Äôll visit the website and see the message? I certainly wasn‚Äôt informed.The ‚ÄòCustomer Care Team‚Äô is rude and unhelpful at best. One actually told me to ‚Äúcome back on at one minute past midnight if it still hasn‚Äôt arrived‚Äù. If I could cancel the current order I‚Äôm waiting for I would, however I reckon I‚Äôll have a better chance of getting my ¬£328 back if I wait for it to arrive and then send it back.

First it said it is going to be here on 23th of May, then on 3rd of June, then on 6th of June,  then it said 17th of june. Seeing them prolong delivery time has been stressfull, but dresses have arrived today (5th of June). So its great, cause my ocassion that I bought them for is tomorow. I contacted customer service via live chat on Web site, they were nice but they said they cannot do anything, maybe they did. Dresses are great, I like the quality, they are Asos brand. Only thing is that, I bought size 38 expecting to alter dresses, and I even lost some weight and they are almost too small. So go size up if u are buying non lace dress."
"June 05, 2019",1,Absolutely terrible customer service,"Absolutely terrible customer service. You are accountable if your package doesn't arrive. Paid for next day delivery, 5.95. The package doesn't arrive. They refuse to refund me the delivery cost because sometimes this can happen 'during busy times' In my opinion if you have someone pay for next day delviery and they don't deliver, you should refund them. They said ' this happens and its not our fault'. If the service is busy, they shouldnt have the option to pay more for delivery. Robbing you blind"
"June 05, 2019",1,Terrible shopping experience,Terrible shopping experience. It‚Äôs an absolute nightmare to return anything- and with my last order two items were missing. Spent a week emailing there customer service daily. No answer. Finally got through on the chat where they informed me that the items were out of stock and that they had refunded the money and emailed me about it. I checked my email and my spam- completely untrue. The customer service agent was patronizing. Total time wasters.
"June 05, 2019",1,What happened to good customer service?,"I can only presume Asos is being run by a different company now or something because recently the customer service is terrible. I have been a loyal customer since I moved to the UK. On 16th May I bought a jacket for my husbands birthday along with some other clothes, used a discount code. The jacket arrived and the sizing it said online was wrong so it was way too big. As the website said they had ‚Äúlimited stock‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt want to miss out on the smaller size I ordered another on the 17th and it arrived on the 18th. He tried it on and we returned the size that was too big. They received the return on 20th and I know as I have tracking. I waited until 29th and emailed as I had not had confirmation they had received it and the website states they email when they receive it. I then emailed again on the 3rd June and got a reply early hours this morning 5th saying I won‚Äôt be getting a refund because I used a discount code. Despite the fact I purchased the jacket already in a smaller size. I am extremely disappointed that they would treat someone like this as I have now bought/paid for two jackets, I only have one of them and they refuse to compensate me"
"June 04, 2019",1,Worst customer service I have ever‚Ä¶,"Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I have been a loyal customer for over 3 years, and have spent god knows how much money on ASOS. And yet, despite that, the moment I have a problem I am treated incredibly poorly. I have sent messages to them that have been completely ignored - both on email and facebook. I have had live chats where I have waited over 15 minutes for the team member to reply. I was told 6 days ago that a manager would be calling me within 24-48 hours, which of course they didnt. when I checked up on it 3 days later I was reassured again that they would call me as soon as possible. When I checked up again today I was told there is no such thing as customer managers, no one would be calling me. I had to call up once again to ask why I had been waiting for 6 days for a nonexistent manager, before being told I would be put on the list AGAIN for a manager to call me. I am so angry and exhausted."
"June 04, 2019",1,Returned items over a week ago....,Returned items (one of wish was faulty with a home in) on 23rd May. Now 4th June and not even a confirmation email to say my refund is being processed. I have checked proof of postage and the parcel was actually delivered on 24th May. Tried to speak to CS and they keep telling me I have to wait until tomorrow (7 working days after posting) to claim a refund and they will do it manually?! Why couldn‚Äôt someone just do it days ago as they have had the parcel for over a week now!!

Their customer service is about as bad as it can get and they really couldn't care less. Refuse to escalate to senior management and ""processes' that involve cutting your off from chat rather than solving the customer's complaints.I wouldn't usually have anything to do with them but needed a fancy dress outfit.They don't deserve a single customer the way they treat them"
"June 04, 2019",1,Where is my order?,"I placed an order on 23rd May, and it's estimated time delivery was 31st May. I still haven't gotten an email saying that the order is shipped. Now they are saying my order will be with me until 7th June, which is hard to believe since it still hasn't been sent.  I contacted ASOS customer help multiple times, as always I got the most generic answers which were not helpful at all, plus probably the most rude customer support I've came across. No one knows where my order is or if it has been sent, but they know that it'll be with me by 7th June. I loved ASOS but having this happen to me and now seeing other reviews I think I'm never ordering from them again."

Was told Next Day delivery can take 4 working days which clearly isn‚Äôt Next Day. My items finally turned up Monday when Hermes could be bothered to deliver and too late for when items were needed for. Gave Asos another chance and now a parcel with dhl parcel which was supposed to be with me 10:37-11:37am hasn‚Äôt arrived it‚Äôs now 3:55pm they ignore their social media and you can‚Äôt talk on the phone, so leaving me in the dark to what‚Äôs happening and now I have to go out after waiting in all day.

"June 04, 2019",3,LONG delays......and no delivery,"I have ordered so many times from Asos, and the delivery was prompt. The products always arrived by the date they had mentioned. This time something is really wrong. The items have not even left the warehouse. There is no tracking number, and on the courier site it shows that for 3 days they are scanning the items. :-(. Contacted costumer service yesterday and they just told me they are sorry and that my order should arrive by tomorrow (it is still in the warehouse). Do miracles happen? Asos should really think of changing their delivery company.EDIT: So I changed my first review from one to three stars, as my order actuallly arrived with one day delay. The problem was there was no email notification regarding the dispatch of the delivery and no tracking number."
"June 04, 2019",1,I ordered an item and...,"I ordered an item and it was supposed to arrive by May 27th in the first place. A little later, they told me it had been delayed and I was supposed to receive my order on May 30th. I didn‚Äôt. I emailed them like a thousand times and now they don‚Äôt even know what happened to my order and keep saying it was supposed to be delivered by now. Nobody knows anything and say that as soon as they know something about it, they will send me and email. I‚Äôve been waiting for almost a week and still nothing. Plus I never received any tracking link so I guess it was never shipped but they claim it was. What a shady company."
"June 04, 2019",2,ASOS have lost my item and won‚Äôt take accountability for it!,"I use ASOS at least three times a month. The ease of their service plus next day delivery is extremely handy. However, their poor customer service really leaves something to be desired. I had to return two package last week but rather than waste time and effort I put both returns with their separate returns stickers and papers in one bag. I received a returns email and refund for ONE of the items but nothing for the other item (that may I repeat...was in the same bag). I contacted ASOS to try to figure out what was going on and the guy was so unhelpful. It would seem they‚Äôve lost the second item, they have no way of tracking they‚Äôve even received the item and I was told to wait 7 days to see if it arrives. I mean....I know it arrived cause an item in the same bag was returned! I ordered in Klarna and was told they wouldn‚Äôt even notify Klarna of their fault. Zero accountability for people‚Äôs items and zero care for their customers as the agent (by the name of Samuel) swiftly told me as he can‚Äôt help further he will end the chat (even though I was still asking him questions). Extremely poor service and extremely disappointing"

It's like they don't want to give me a refund. The clothes were smelly and big, I've been shopping with asos for 7yrs now but their products are going downhill,  always sending smelly clothes.

WHAT KIND OF BACK ALLY SHIPPING IS THIS!!I have already messaged customer care twice and both times they said it was out of their hands once it went through the shipping process hahaha THANKS ASOS!!I honestly hope they close or someone who gives a crap buys them out but anyone who has read this spend your money anywhere else!!"
"June 04, 2019",1,Absolute worst customer service,"Absolute worst customer service. I ordered clothes for two events (one being my brothers wedding) and paid for two day shipping. They messed up and sent it standard. When I tried to get help and have them amend their mistake by canceling the order and resending it with the correct shipping, they said I could reorder it again and choose day shipping again, and basically hope it works out. ZERO HELP. Their customer service is consistently trash. I hope they go out of business."
"June 03, 2019",1,Awful delivery & awful customer service,"Ordered from asos paid extra for a Sunday delivery, specifically for that day due to being at work the rest of the time. There are two main doors in my block flats; the delivery driver tried one of the doors (the wrong door) to ring my flat and I then received a 'sorry we missed you' email. Bear in mind I was sat at home the whole of Sunday. Asos refusing to refund delivery charge because the 'driver did attempt delivery'. Won't be using asos again"
"June 03, 2019",1,Unacceptable from GNEWT,I have shopped with ASOS for around 4-5 years now and never had an issue.But since ASOS have partnered with GNEWT their delivery system has gone down hill dramatically. Now I am not blaming ASOS but they should have never tried to go green and hire a group of miscreants/uneducated/slow people to deliver their parcels I would not be making this review.For 4 years i have never has an issue nor have i ever complained about ASOS but GNEWT took 2 days to deliver a next day deliver for i order i placed 29/05. I have also placed a second order on the 03/06 for next day delivery just to be dissapointed AGAIN.
"June 03, 2019",1,Technical Difficulties Unresolved,"Technical difficulties registering for the 25% off promo for students, Live Chat was absolutely appalling, I'd dread to think how much business this company has lost due to the lack of support provided to customers. Chatted to 3 people, 1st person told me it's a TOTUM/NUS fault despite it being a technical fault on the ASOS website.2nd person, closed the chat saying they had technical difficulties.3rd person, said the same as above then ignored me.I was ordering some office wear and the 25% off would've helped me greatly as I was placing a significant order of around ¬£300, I'll be buying the items elsewhere.Never again, will i touch ASOS or give them my money, I'd advise you all to do the same."
"June 03, 2019",1,Poor customer service,"Poor customer service, I pay for Premier Delivery to get next day delivery so when I place an order I get this automatically. They have now changed the default to 'standard delivery' which takes around a week. This seems a cynical way to save money as if you don't spot it you can't change it after the order. I also can't cancel the order even though it's a week away. Disappointing will now avoid."

I used THEIR included return label to ship my items back and they are now saying that they never received the package and that it was my responsibility to get a tracking ID. How does that make any sense? They included a return label, so they should have that information. I've never had an issue until this order but I will not be ordering from them again and I have disputed the charges through my bank.

I've never had a bad experience for delivery either."
"May 31, 2019",1,Poor customer service!,"I ordered three jumpers from ASOS with a 20% discount code but needed to exchange 2 of them for size as they were gifts and I got the sizes wrong. I spoke to someone on the live chat feature and was told that the best option would be to return and then order them again as there was a 20% code active on that day too. When I got the email confirming my return, I could see that they weren‚Äôt sending the full refund I was entitled to because the ‚Äúrefund‚Äù (even though I wanted an exchange and was advised to go through this route instead) meant that the total of my original order had dropped to ¬£90 and the original 20% code was only for purchases over ¬£100. The easiest option to resolve my issue was simply send me the extra money I am owed but instead, ASOS want me to return the original jumper and then order it again (there is another 20% offer today) which just seems ridiculous to me. I tried speaking to someone on live chat but this person called ‚ÄúFreddie‚Äù was extremely rude and closed the chat before I was even finished. I then called ASOS and this advisor (who actually had some customer service skill) said he would refer my case to the Escalations team and they would call me back today. Still awaiting this call but I don‚Äôt have a lot of hope and will probably have to go through the hassle of returning my original jumper, order the same one again (at delivery cost to ASOS) and essentially waste a whole load of time and effort on mine and ASOS part.."
"May 31, 2019",1,ASOS - POOR SHOW ON YOUR PART,"I am an very avid customer of Asos and I have had one or two issues in the past with service but it was quickly resolved. However, I am very disappointed with a recent order. I did not receive an item within the order I received. I notified them of this and they came back within 24 hrs. They said they will resolve and apologised. However, If they ship today 31.05.19 they say i will not receive the item until Friday June 7th. I am away on that day for a trip and i have asked if they could ship it quicker for me.  They have said no. The funny thing is, if i make a purchase from their site today, i will have the items within 3/4 days, sooner to what i am being offerer, for their mistake. Why is this fair or acceptable? I spend a lot of money with them and now i am seriously discouraged from purchasing with them again. Poor customer service for a mistake I did not make."
"May 31, 2019",1,Disgusted,I have been a longstanding customer ordering over 5 times yearly and always vouched for the service and timeliness. HOWEVER this has changed... made an order on the 20th of May. I never received a dispatch email (like I usually do). One day prior to the delivery date (28th May) I spoke to customer care who asked me to wait until midnight of the said delivery date.. It was pretty obvious that the order was not going to arrive.. I have now been asked to wait until the 3rd June.. up until today (31st may) I have not received any dispatch email. I then stupidly went and re-ordered one of the items using the next day delivery service costing me 20euros extra because I needed the item for an occasion tomorrow (2nd june). Delivery date was meant to be 30th May.. Guess what? Today 31st May and the package has not arrived. The DHL tracking number provided is incorrect!! Absolutely appalled by the service!!!!!! ASOS please get your act together...

Now they are telling me to allow until the end of 7th June (Friday of course, so they can buy themselves more time) because of any postal and/or shipping delays. On Monday the 10th, they'll tell me to allow until the end of 14th. I wonder how long will I have to do this. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY.I've always been satisfied with their service, delivery and clothes that were provided. Turns out, that was only because I never encountered a problem. I placed an order on the 23rd of May. They promptly sent me an order confirmation, and took money out of my account the day after that. I never got a shipping confirmation, but since they stated the order will be here on the 31st, I didn't give it much thought. On the 30th of May, I spoke with their customer care (care as word here is used reaaaaally broadly), and basically they don't know anything, no connections to their warehouse, no knowledge about my order, it's like they don't even work for ASOS. All that they could do is, with obviously scripted words, ‚Äûreassure‚Äú me that my order is due on the 31st. Told me to wait, even though it seems ludicrous that the order will arrive on time, but fine, I can wait one more day. Well, Friday the 31st arrived and lo and behold, my order didn't arrive (which is obvious to everyone SINCE IT HADN'T SHIPPED). And now I get to repeat the whole process.Reached out to customer care again on the 31st, told me to get in touch on Monday, there's nothing they can do now. I am not dissatisfied just because of the order. I am completely dissatisfied with their treatment of the costumers and their absurdly incompetent way of training customer care employees. Obviously the people who work there aren't at fault here, they are just saying what they are told to, but it is so frustrating to even read what they type, it feels like I'm talking to a computer, but like the one from 1995. I don't want to be the 'you just lost a customer' person, but you definitely lost a customer.I'm giving it two stars only because the products are good quality, and I never had any problem until now."
"May 31, 2019",1,I agree with all other feedback,I agree with all other feedback. The worst company to deal with. They should be closed down due to BAD reviews. Where is the Australian Consumer when you need them.  Someone should report them & stop them selling online products.

"May 30, 2019",1,Avoid at all cost!,"I have been a loyal customer with ASOS in many years. I still regularly  order from ASOS, but I think I have placed my last ever order with them.The customer ""care"" is perhaps the worst customer service I have ever been in touch with. No understanding and no wanting to fix the problems.My previous order from them was cancelled due to one item not being in stock - even though they were clearly available on the website. Not compensation or anything. Just a horribly arrogant customer care person.But my last order really made me reconsider every using ASOS again. They simply do not care - at all. I purchased a lot of clothes from them - and to make sure the order would get to me in time I payed for next day delivery. When I didn't get the order by evening on the promised date of delivery I contacted the customer support. But he wouldn't help me until the next day! He would not even look into the case until the following day! - he wouldn't even confirm whether my items was shipped or not. Today I contacted the customer service again. This time I was forwarded to another department which I was told would solve my problem. I have still have not heard anything from them - 12 hours later. Nothing..I used to recommend ASOS to everyone. Now I say - avoid at all cost!"
"May 30, 2019",1,Delivery is a joke,"I'm not one to write reviews, but I've SO many bad experiences with ASOS deliveries now that I felt it was time I shared so new customers are aware of what to expect. The customer care team are probably amongst the worst I have ever dealt with. It's clear that ASOS do not care at all about their customers and the experience they have shopping with them. My last order turned up broken and I didn't get a new one for weeks because the customer care team sent the new one to the wrong address and then blamed me for incorrect details (despite this being a renewal request to the same address). Because of the mess up, I spent weeks arguing with them about the order, I was told I wasn't getting a new one despite paying for it, and when I finally got sent a new one, it arrived after the time I needed it (supposed to be a Christmas gift).I now have placed another very large order and was told it would arrive on a specific date to find it has been pushed back by 2 weeks. I was relying on this order because I am going on holiday and I now won't get these items in time. I ordered this with 2 weeks clearance to make sure I'd get the items on time but still ASOS can't deliver within that window. I swear they do this to people to try and get them to buy into the next day delivery costs. It's a total joke."
"May 30, 2019",1,Don't use their 20% off Codes,"Absolutely shocking company I would go as far as to say scammers. I used a 20% discount when you spend ¬£100. Decided to return one item out of the four I ordered and was shocked when I seen a top worth ¬£32 was refunded ¬£10.40. I contacted customer services and was told the entire discount I received had been deducted from that one item as the discount code was now expired! Absolutely disgusting, wouldn't have used the code or bought anything from them if I knew this beforehand. Their discount codes are clearly a way of making money off people when they return items. I will never use this company again, honestly dont know how they get away with treating customers like this. They're trustpilot rating says it all really."
"May 30, 2019",1,Absolutely abysmal customer service,"Absolutely abysmal customer service. There was a fault in my item and I wanted an exchange in size. Simple issue and I have so far had a good experience with ASOS, thinking that it would be straight cut procedure, I contacted customer service. Spent HOURS talking to 2 people on chat, Jacob and Shannan, both giving me completely different solutions that would ultimately lead to more costs on MY part when it was THEIR faulty item. I had to call the actual customer service phone number regarding the matter because I had enough of the rude and unhelpful replies from the chat. Even on the call, they seemed disinterested and disregarded any complaints I made. What annoys me most is that they‚Äôre a huge company that can clearly afford to appease any customer complaints with good service or even a discount to shut me up. But they refuse to do so. So disappointed."
"May 30, 2019",1,My first experience with ASOS may be the last...,"My first experience with ASOS may be the last. I really love their body-type inclusivity, but my first experience with them was horrifying and stressful. I ordered 4 purchases with Premier Delivery. 3 of them was on their way but with NO FUNCTIONAL TRACKING and while I asked them again and again what was going on, they just told me to wait. I had to contact UPS myself to have it fixed... then 2 of those orders arrive later than the date I paid for them to arrive in. Remember there was 4 purchases? Yeah the last one hasn't been SHIPPED YET! They kept telling me to wait and wait and I'm having it. I told them again and again I don't want the order anymore cause I'm travelling soon (the whole reason I paid for premier delivery!) and I want a full refund, but they refuse! They were quick to take my money but won't deliver in time nor cancel a very delayed parcel. Their twitter service @ASOSHereToHelp is so automated and impersonal and eventually they start ignoring you, despite it being their fault for not delivering on their part. I'm enraged and I need the money that they're withholding from me, for my trip. They STILL haven't fixed this problem for me!"
"May 30, 2019",1,Terrible customer service!,I ordered a large quality of clothing from ASOS and then their delivery partner Yodel lost the parcel. I contacted ASOS to arrange a refund or new order to be dispatched but they have said they can‚Äôt process this until they first parcel comes back to them. This will never happen as the parcel has been lost so I‚Äôm now ¬£177 out of pocket. I contacted the online chat and the advisor Amber was probably the most unhelpful person I have ever come across. Shocking customer service!
"May 30, 2019",1,I can not comprehend the poor level of customer service,"I paid for the premier membership, and then promptly had it cancelled (without refund) and my account blocked. No one can tell me what I did wrong, and for some insane reason, customer service can not look into it, because it's a ""different department""Isn't that the entire point of customer service, to speak to the relevant department to resolve issues??They just keep telling me to reply to the security email, which I keep doing, but keep getting told it routed to the wrong team and to do it again. This has been going for 2 weeks now, and not a single customer service agent could even pretend they gave a sh.I feel like I'm in an alternate dimension, from how bad this customer service is."

I have talked with BLANE who was not able to tell me if the order left the deposit or not but just to wait for more days, selling me confusing information about the postal services/courier. I usually receive my Asos order via courier with a tracking number. He told to me about postal delays in my area but after that he told me about the order being sent via courier. So after talking with him I have no idea if the order was sent via postal services or via courier or if it was really shipped. When I asked if the package left their deposit he just closed the chat in my face.I hope I will receive this order but the new one will never happen from my side."

I can't seem to get my head around the bad reviews here, I have never had a problem with delivery and their returns policy and process is SO SIMPLE!

"May 28, 2019",1,I wouldn't have given even a single‚Ä¶,I wouldn't have given even a single star. I regret that why didn't I go through the reviews before ordering. I placed an order worth 200 CAD. And it has been a month I am neither sent the tracking number nor did i receive my package on the estimated delivery time period. When i contacted the customer service they say that wait further more for another 20 Days. Also they said ...inquire about it from your local postage service as we don't have tracking number. How un professional is that. My package is not here and I have to go around searching my local post offices. The customer service itself is pathetic. I would never make future purchases from ASOS a pathetic place to order.
"May 28, 2019",1,Keep ordering things then getting email‚Ä¶,"Keep ordering things then getting email saying Asos doesn't have it in stock. Delivery is slow and will definetely never order from Asos again. If you do not have it in stock, then update your f****** website"

UPS cannot track my return and ASOS refuses to give me any information from my return label that could help UPS track my return. This mistake has cost me $500. I am in disbelief.
"May 27, 2019",1,Worst customer service ever!,"Worst customer service ever!I wanted a simple invoice after paying for my order but on their website it says that you have to wait 45 days after your order in order to ask for an invoice. That's already absurd. Nevertheless, uncontent with their long waiting time for issuing such a simple document, when I asked them for an invoice 45 days after my purchase, they replied saying that they need 30 working days to issue one!!!!! That is INSANE! An invoice should be issued upon payment. You don't go to the supermarket to buy groceries and receive an invoice 75 days later. What's so difficult about making one? I'm not even sure that this is legal. I paid for something and I want an invoice! As a consumer that's one of my most basic right and I don't understand how they so unashamedly deny it!"

This has happened on several occasions and thought out all our bad experiences the customer care has been shocking!

When I contact customer service, they are totally bad as one of just close the chat on me. If they want to play like this with me, that's fine, I do the same to them. I asked for a refund for my shipping fee, but they refused to answer the question and instead said something nonsense. So if you want to purchase something from this company, don't!! You will get your product but will end up wasting money and time. The service are just unacceptable! I would even gave them zero or even minus stars for their service. This is something that trust-pilot should have looked into. This company won't make any customers to be satisfied. I guess all the good reviews are just made up not from real customers. If they think their service is good enough, why refused to answer the question about refunding shipping fee. I can see the unprofessional skills in this company and it should have not run more further. Hopefully they will go bankrupt one day and you shouldn't be supporting them. There customer service are unreliable. I can keep complaining all day!"

"May 24, 2019",1,Be Wary of Misleading Prices and Discounts!,"I used a 20% student discount for an order totalling ¬£229.00. When you place your order you receive an e-mail that displays each item you ordered at their full unit price and the discount is deducted at the end of the order total. I paid ¬£197.75 which works out as a discount of 13.65%, which can't be right.I queried this with their online chat because I returned some of the items and I couldn't work out if I was being refunded the correct amount. The person I spoke to online, Marilyn, was extremely rude and cagey and refused to give me these numbers. She told me she ""calculated them using maths"" and ended the chat on me without solving my query.Well, I've used the same maths to calculate my discount and the numbers don't add up. I spent a lot of money here and I'm not convinced I'm being correctly refunded. I will not be using this service again."
"May 24, 2019",1,Awful absolutely awful,Awful customer service!!! Lately like my last probably 5 orders have arrived late even though I have next day delivery! Every time I contact them asking where my order is I get the same useless response. They always tell me to wait 24 hours before contacting then after that they say I have to wait a whole week (!!) before they can track where it is even though I paid for NEXT DAY delivery? It just doesn‚Äôt make sense?? And as this has happened to me frequently i always complain and they just tell me that it‚Äôs out of their control?? Which if it‚Äôs happening so frequently then they should probably get a handle on things and sort it out. It‚Äôs so frustrating.
"May 24, 2019",1,Awful Customer Service,"Reading all these reviews makes me wonder why I ever shopped with asos. Ordered an item and was sent the wrong item, the very unhelpful customer service team told me it was likely to be an isolated case and to order again and return the first item. I did and the second item arrived wrong again. I have now paid for the item twice and not received it once. This alone would be quite annoying, but what has motivated me to write a review is the appalling customer service. The ""chat"" team take so long to respond to every message, respond with generic responses and offer no flexibility for their customers. Both times I was just told to return the item, I was given no apology no compensation - even though they acknowledged that it was a mistake of one of their staff members to tell me to order again."
"May 24, 2019",1,I bought from ASOS for years but when‚Ä¶,"I bought from ASOS for years but when things for wrong their customer service is absolutely shocking. I often order things on next day delivery, often they don't turn up the next day and I am simply told to wait. Constant generic responses recieved about an on going issue and so the issue takes a life time to resolve because the customer service agents are too busy cutting and pasting what seems appropriate when if they actually read the email trail they would see it is not. I also regularly get incorrect items recieved, one example being when I ordered a mens converse t shirt for my partner but recieved some lady underwear!Mistakes happen but you barely get a sorry, nevermind any recompense for the inconvenience caused."

You are supposed to receive an email within 10 business days that your item has been received and an refund is being issued to your account. Its been 15 business days and my package has not been received yet. I have contacted customer care multiple times and they copy and paste the same message. They require proof of postage to look into this, although the other forms of proof of postage they require are included in the package that was sent back. I have voiced my concerns through their livechat and it always goes back to ‚Äúyou need proof of postage.‚Äù Which I explained I do not have. I asked this one person who was working the live chat a question, and her response was ‚Äúnow I see I have answered all your questions, I‚Äôm going to go ahead and end this chat.‚Äù and closed the chat So I started emailing. I have been passed on to different people and eventually asked if I could set up a phone call with them (because they don‚Äôt have a call center!) They said yes and asked me when. I told them the day and time I‚Äôm free, which was today, and I have not received a phone call from them. Instead, yesterday I received an email from a different member of customer service saying they were looking into this and will get back to me soon-still haven‚Äôt heard anything.

Once they're happy this is a genuine claim, they may refund your account.  In the event further orders are placed, they'll be cancelled. As we‚Äôre unable to help you further with this, any emails received about this matter will be automatically closed down with no response.‚ÄùTHIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND THE LEADERSHIP TEAM SHOULD BE CONCERNED.

I recieved an email to say they were not going to accept my return because they don't sell that tshirt even though ASOS sent me that top.Basically accusing me of switching t-shirts!I am appalled at ASOS and how THEY sent me the wrong t-shirt but have the cheek to call me a liar!!!!
"May 22, 2019",1,One star is being too generous,"One star is being too generous. I would rate this brand and company ZERO stars if I could. First of all, as soon as the order was late, I contacted Customer Service and they said I had to wait another 20 DAYS before they could do anything about it. When my order did arrive, not only was the order 9 days late, IT WAS THE WRONG ITEM AND THE WRONG SIZE. Not to mention, the product is poor quality. This was my first AND LAST time buying from this company."

"May 21, 2019",1,Poor level of service when something‚Ä¶,"Poor level of service when something goes wrong. My ¬£100 order to my usual saved address was sent to the wrong address in the UK due to the tracking label being incorrect. ASOS refused to take ownership and advised me to check my details in future, despite my address being correct on the order, and to place another order. I was advised by the delivery provider that I could not amend the details only ASOS could. They advised me I would have to wait 7 working days for the item to returned as ‚ÄúI refused the order‚Äù, then wait another 5 to 10 days for my refund. No solution, ownership or means to escalate this. Simply generic response. If something goes wrong ASOS will not compensate you or process your refund."
"May 21, 2019",1,Never again!!!,"Ordered shoes in black color, size 43. Got blue with white shoes of size 42. Customer service is useless, didn't provide me with any help that I needed, only standard replies. Moreover, in the end they just simply laid all the responsibility on Aramex, who are handling returns and did not help with anything. So I got a 3 weeks hassle because of their mistake! Never again!"
"May 21, 2019",1,Inadequate service in every way,"On multiple occasions I have been sent the wrong items in the wrong sizes, they have subsequently run out of the correct item. Customer service were less than helpful; not only in the chat did they clearly not read my message correctly, they didn‚Äôt answer my questions and sounded in a hurry. For example when I said I had been sent the wrong dress, the reply I got was: I will have a look at why your order was sent to the wrong address. Very frustrating. I order online because my working hours make it difficult for me to shop in store. However I have now not had an outfit for events due to the time and money wasted at ASOS."

"May 20, 2019",1,AVOID at all cost,"AVOID at all cost! I spent 5 hours trying to solve issues their poor and incompetent customer service caused me. First I tried to chat online with an agent. She said hi and disappeared. I kept waiting for more than 15minutes. I texted again to no avail so I ended the chat. Shortly after, I started another chat  and I was informed that the premier delivery won't work for my international shipping just to be informed by a third agent after I placed my order with standard shipping that it would have worked. I contacted them the third time to make sure my sizes were correct since the UK store provides different conversions than the US store. Everyone tells me something different until it finally became clear to me that I got the wrong sizes. So I contacted them for a fourth time to cancel my order but they would not do it because 60mins have passed since I placed my order. Of course it passed while I was moving from inept agent to another seeking information and help. I tried to at least have them amend the order and they wouldn't either. The thing is the estimated delivery date is too late for me. I'm traveling and won't be back before end of August and they keep repeating that I could return the order. They are robots. They copy-paste the same response to all concerns. How am I going to return it if I will be gone by the time it arrives?! Worse yet, I only have 45 days to return and they would not extend it since they are the reason I am in this miserable situation. After I insisted to talk to a manager or someone who could help, Patrick who has been talking like a robot decided to end the chat. The shady business is run by a bunch of pathetic, incompetent and dishonest agents. Story short is because of their poor handling of the situation and misleading customer service, I now ended up with an order that has wrong sizes, won't arrive on time and won't be able to return within their 45days. P.S. I chatted with Adeena, Salman, Charlotte and finally Patrick."
"May 20, 2019",1,No Refund on Returned item,Sent back a pair of shorts over two weeks ago using their provided returns label and haven't had any refund. Contacted customer service who have said they can't do anything unless I have the tracking number. Shouldn't they be able to figure out the tracking number of the returns label they provided for my sale???
"May 20, 2019",1,False price promise advertising,"They advertise price promise on their website on non - asos non sale product. They will refund you the price on the next purchase. Fair enough. However when try to claim on your order they say, they can't do it. They even do not take the time to read emails properly. I pointed out NEXT has the same dress for ¬£20 less, they replied since I bought the dress from NEW LOOK (which is wrong just because it starts with ""NE"" it doesn't mean it's the same shop), I can't have a price promise. I did spend ¬£110 on order 408481734 bought from Asos, but they refuse to keep their word on price promise. Guess what? If this does not get resolved, I will buy it from Next.Update: they confirmed that i get no money back garantee after two days. By that time the dress on the Next website was gone. Result? I am returning all the merchandise I bought in the past week from Asos. That's almost ¬£300 worth of clothing. You lost a customer"

"May 18, 2019",1,The absolute worst in the industry,The absolute worst in the industry! Rude condescending people. My disabled neighbor who is wheelchair bound ordered something and instead of delivering it they took it to a pick up location. She went on live chat to speak to someone and the agent said too bad unless you don‚Äôt have legs you need to go get the package! What?! Who says that and then puts in writing which means the company supports this.  I have never in my life heard of such a thing. She took screenshots and plans to blast social media with it. This company is disgusting.
"May 18, 2019",1,Worst service from ASOS,I ordered an expensive wallet ASOS online for birthday present I have been promised a delivery they failed to deliver 1st promise. Then later I rang and agreed 2nd delivery slot waited for another week and again they failed to delivery. Not even a single courtesy call to track my order I had to keep ringing. Now they are saying can‚Äôt cancel my order and I had to wait again 3 rd to receive my order. Unhappy with their service Customer service really useless apart from hearing apologises but no actions taken for my call or my order. I would not recommend to use ASOS it‚Äôs just a waste of time based on my personal experience.
"May 18, 2019",1,Avoid avoid avoid. Bunch of fools.,"If I could give zero stars I would. Been using Asos for years, always had pleasant service etc. But this time when I ordered some shoes they sent me Two left feet and one was the right size and the other was the wrong size, all in one box. How does that even happen. I spoke to customer service and all they said was they can only apologise. I pay for next day delivery, pointless. Then I returned them and they have the cheek to send me the wrong size again, atleast this time they sent me the correct right and left shoes. Pointless no point in returning as I needed the shoes last week and it's taken a whole two weeks to sort out. Avoid this company like the plague, worst company ever. Didnt even offer an compensation or anything for their mistake. DISGUSTING COMPANY AND EVERYONE SHOULD AVOID THESE FOOLS."

I am leaving London (was only visiting) and they are telling me that they can't contact the courier to track the package, they won't refund me or give me store credit, and I need to have a neighbor mail it back. So I am out $50 because their incompetent carrier and yet they sit there and spout robotic blurbs about how they are focused on customer service then just end the chat.

It was my first order so I thought, eh maybe they run small. I ordered a second pair of sandals (that were not wide fit) in my size and they were MASSIVE. I‚Äôm talking like at least 2 sizes too big. I am reading over their website and they ENCOURAGE ordering multiple sizes and colors to ensure you get what you need and you send back the rest for a ‚Äúfull refund‚Äù. So I ordered a size down in the sandals...still massive. Then when I try to return my items, not only do they tell me they don‚Äôt refund shipping costs BUT THEY DIDN‚ÄôT EVEN REFUND THE FULL SALES TAX AMOUNT.

"May 15, 2019",1,I advise people not to use ASOS,"I advise people not to use ASOS. I ordered an item on 30th April and received a confirmation email to say my order had been received and should arrive by 8th May. On the 2nd May I received another email telling me my parcel had been despatched and later that day I checked the tracking through Hermes website which said that the item had already arrived at the local depot. However when I checked the tracking on Friday 3rd May it said that my order had been delayed but that Hermes would get the package moving again within the next 24 hours. However when I checked back five days later on the day the parcel was supposed to have arrived, the tracking hadn't changed and hadn't been updated since 3rd May. I contacted customer service through the chat. They told me my parcel could still arrive on 8th right up to midnight (Really!) so to contact them the following day. So I did but this time I was told there was nothing they could do until 7 working days after the last time the parcel was tracked. I was told by customer services the date I needed to get back in touch for them to resolve my issue was today (15th May). I also expressed my wish to complain at this point and the customer service advisor said they would pass my complaint on. So just as I had been advised I contacted customer services again today (more than two weeks since I ordered the item) to ask for a full refund and was told they can't resolve it until tomorrow. It is just ridiculous. I just keep getting told a later and later date! I am a busy working working mother of two young children and haven't got the time to keep contacting them. Other companies I have used would have resolved the issue right away. I will never use ASOS again."

Paid for next day delivery and the guy doesn't show up but i receive a message saying sorry I missed you.... I asked for a refund as the event takes place tomorrow so there is no need for the items anymore and they just come back with the sassiest responses. The Head of Client Services really needs to reassess the care and training of this department.

I found the exact same item on their website listed twice but with a $33 price difference as one was in their 'tall' range and the other in their normal. Staff confirmed it was the identical item.  Upon asking if they would provide it to me for the lower price  as they did not have my size in the cheaper listing I was told "" we cannot help you that is the price if there is no other issue you can close the screen"". The live chat was horrendously slow and beyond rude. A shame because their products are so good. Makes me double think using them."

I called back straight away and was told by Russel that he is too busy to speak to me as he has other phone calls to make.Will not be using ASOS again

I placed an order that was supposed to be delivered by the 30th of April. When the parcel never arrived, I was never notified about a delay or any other issue occurred. When I chased their team, the representatives gave me faulty information about the parcel that was first damaged and then they told me that was just delayed and I need to wait till the 11th. Of course, the parcel was never delivered and the tracking was never updated. When I chased them again, I had to repeat again the history as none of them were reading the previous messages. After 10 days, they said that Hermes informed them that the parcel was damaged on the transit and was returned to them around the 1st of May and that I had to wait for the refund although previous to that they told me to wait for the delivery till the 11th.  Again no update for the next 4 days and I had to chase them for another 4-5 times in order to process the refund for an order that was not delivered for the past 15 days! Needless to say that none of the representatives offered any compensation or apologized for what happened and were only responding with canned responses and templates! I WILL DEFINITELY NOT USE THIS HORRIBLE COMPANY AGAIN! AVOID!"
"May 14, 2019",1,ASOS sent the parcels for their Finish customers with faulty tracking information.,"Same basically as Anna there typed. Finnish customer, placed an order on 2nd of May, got an e-mail on 6th from UB Send that the parcel is relabelled for delivery. Parcel was supposed to be here in 14th. It was not, I also didn't get any type of tracking info with the JJFI code, and had two separate ones from the UB Send. Contacted Finnish Posti, they said that ASOS just has shipped a huge ammount of parcels to Finnish customers with faulty tracking codes and Posti is unable to tell that will the Finnish ASOS customers ever rece√≠ve the parcels they ordered. Contacted ASOS, they say that I would have to wait to 23rd to able to ask about refund - that's plus 10 days to their standard 25 day refund timeframe. I asked to show the company policy, which supposedly prevents them from doing an immediate refund. They didn't do that, linked me to a page about UK Precise Delivery Service (Finland is not even on the list of countries to which they provide that service). The page had zero mentionings about ASOS refund policies. Got an immediate impression, that the extra 10 days is for them to use some kind of loop hole and not make the refunds in case the parcels don't actually reach their Finnish customers before that 23rd. On top of that the customer service was quite weak, not rude, just not helpful. Thoughts about an internet scam are now floating in my head."

I complained and asked for at leat a proportioanate discounted refund eg ¬£31 and they still did not honour it. Absolutely appauled! So disappointing. Myself, friends and family will not be using.

Was then automatically sent back to there depot and I have to wait up to 7 days for a refund, for products that I never had the chance to collect! The only way I can now get them is by re-ordering and spending more without even receiving the refund. Also funny how, when this was ordered they were running a 20% student discount, which has now gone back to the normal 10. And the best I have been offered is a 15% discount now. So I have to pay more money that I had originally planned to get the same items two weeks later. Embarrassing for an online only company."

"May 10, 2019",1,Absolutely atrocious.,"Absolutely atrocious.Didn‚Äôt even attempt to deliver, when tracking my ‚Äònext day paid for delivery‚Äô it states from the courier that Asos have requested the package be returned before they even received it.Spoke to their customer service team who gave no reason for the return, cancelled my order and said ‚Äòcheck online if you want to repurchase the items, but we won‚Äôt refund you for 5-10 working days‚ÄôStay clear, horrific experience!!!"
"May 10, 2019",1,Expired promotion code was still‚Ä¶,"Expired promotion code was still showing on their website and app but pushed the blame to me for not clearing my cache. 1 minute later, the expire promotion code banner miraculously disappeared without me clearing my cache. It is ok if they could just admit their mistake and apologize. I can wait till the next promotion. It is not ok when they blame customer for their mistakes. That customer service officer I communicated with is Sophie."
"May 10, 2019",1,Their ‚Äúintelligent return‚Äù process‚Ä¶,"Their ‚Äúintelligent return‚Äù process involved only a few simple steps. The ‚Äúfew simple steps‚Äù include filling up a form much like ones where you are signing up a complete new account with an online shop. You are required to put in your name, email address, full mailing address, phone number, order number, garment code, garment description, amount of the purchase, quantity.. that‚Äôs not the end, then u select the way to return it, and any options u choose, it will return a ‚ÄòWe are sorry, the service you have selected is temporarily down. Please check back later when normal service will be restored. Thank you for your patience‚Äô. When you write in to their chat service asking for help, u will get response such as ‚Äòchange your browser, clear your cache, opsss nothing we can do, bye bye!‚Äô So if U want to purchase anything from ASOS, make sure u don‚Äôt return it as you just can‚Äôt!"
"May 10, 2019",1,If I could give 0 stars I would,"If I could give 0 stars I would, customer service representatives are a nightmare to deal with. When you pay for express shipping and no one can tell you where your order is is absolutely disgraceful. On live chat they just end the conversation and you have to reconnect with another representative to have the exact same thing happen again. No Courtesy email to let you know that your shipment is delayed. First and last time shopping with ASOS!!!!!!!!"
"May 10, 2019",1,Express delivery false advertisement!,"I wish I had search up reviews prior to ordering. Disappointed with the service, click express delivery and items were meant to arrived yesterday and it still hasn‚Äôt till now! Contacted customer service not helpful at all, saying it may be the local postal issues, the tracking has not been updated at all! What‚Äôs the point of doing express delivery really?!"
"May 10, 2019",1,Shipping issues,"Even though they had not dispatched my item, they still refused to update my shipping details. They sent the item interstate to an address from 6 years ago, even though my updated address was in my address book. Fair enough if they had sent the items already, but I had not received any shipping confirmation and they would not even notify me of the courier service they were using so I could attempt to redirect my order. So disappointed and as a student it was pretty detrimental to my funds."
"May 09, 2019",1,WARNING do not pay for Express delivery.  Bad delivery service and useless customer service,Bad delivery service.  We purposely bought more items so we can have Express delivery.  The package is not 2 days late.  I did an online chat with my daughter and all they kept saying is that its arriving but they can't guarantee it because it is already in my local area. I ask them to contact courier but they said they can't or maybe try just don't want to. Then when I told them that I'm the mother of the account holder that paid for the items and they hung up.on me. How very rude. They've been taking my daughter on a run around.  WARNING do not pay for Express delivery because it does not arrive on their specified date.
"May 09, 2019",3,Absolutely disgusting,Absolutely disgusting. ¬£160 dress from ASOS just chucked over the fence and left in the rain all day. Directions to leave in garden shed which was left open as well as the side gate ignored. Worst delivery service. Wish places like ASOS would use Royal Mail instead. Dress is nice and good quality a shame about delivery service chosen.
"May 09, 2019",1,Always problems with Delivery,Always problems with Delivery. Pay extra for a faster delivery service---> still receive the packages late. Like up to 4 days late. Would love to continue shopping here but probably won't because of the horrible delivery.... Get your sh** together DHL & ASOS.
"May 09, 2019",1,"Shocking, robotic service","Shocking, have always used asos and have spent hundreds of pounds with them. I had to get in touch with them to find out where my items were after 2 weeks of waiting! Just to be told that I would have to wait for it to be returned to them by their courier which would be another 7-10 working days and then wait 5-10 working days for my refund. This will be well over a month they have had my money. Their response emails and robotic and obvious templates. Makes me furious. I even told them to keep the money and give me a voucher instead, I just need the clothes!!!!!!"
"May 09, 2019",1,DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE,"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE. I was an optimistic first time shopper. Ordered tights and a dress for an upcoming wedding, this order was placed 9 days ago. They charged me 6 days ago, but no package. When I contacted their live-robot-chat-lady today, she gave me a lot of non-answers and told me I could expect a delay of a week, on some packages. I have friends experiencing the same issues. I asked if I would be compensated, robot-woman replied that they have offers on the website. I will not return to this page."
"May 08, 2019",1,Blamed for their mistake,"Sent me out a faulty return label, then told me 8 days after it was delivered. By this point I had already posted. They then blamed me for not getting proof of postage I have now lost ¬£30 and they are not willing to help at all."

Over the past 5 days i have had nothing but problems. The first problem happened on Saturday, with a technical glitch on the site which listed the incorrect delivery address. Being made aware of this i contacted dhl to cancel this and return to asos, and contacted asos, yet the parcel was still delivered to the incorrect address, with tracking details stating god knows who that has signed for it. Despite me kicking up a fuss, i still made another order the next day, Conveniently i collected this order today from my click and collect and then from the 9 items that should have been received only 1 item was in the parcel. Coincidence or deliberate. So far i am playing email back and forth with no resolution, I will be sure to not shop with asos again!"

"May 08, 2019",1,Worst customer service and company,"Worst customer service for such an established company! Paid for premier delivery and still haven't received my order 6 days later. Customer service consists of being passed around to different people via email, and being told that managers in the company do not exist. I was told that if I had paid for one off next day delivery I was able to get a refund, however paying premier I wasn't able to get one. So you are punished for paying more. I was then told that I can't cancel my premier subscription so can continue to enjoy next day delivery throughout the year. The customer ""care"" made me feel as if they were mocking me and not handling my queries at all. Judging by all the other reviews I'm not the only one. Will NOT be using ASOS again and will be telling anyone and everyone that will listen not to either. So disappointed in this established company."

Charging extra money for next day delivery and the product never came. No reason was given for the delay and when I started to complain just received an email that your money will be refunded and that too just for the dress,  still charging me for the delivery that never took place!!Dont even have a complain procedure , customer service is the lowest level possible . Dont know who is running this stupid brand .Stay away"

"May 07, 2019",1,Sent the wrong item...,"I was sent the wrong item and customer service agent gave me a generic script about how I have to wait until they receive it back to refund me. On top of that, they tell me the original item I ordered is out of stock and I can only replace my order for a different item with a different transaction. They literally do nothing to correct the issue, send me out of my way to send the item back, and issue a refund only when they receive their incorrect merchandise back.The original order was for a 100% leather jacket and I was instead sent a 100% polyurethane Asos branded leather jacket that looked nothing like the jacket I ordered and the price difference was significant."
"May 07, 2019",1,"Didn't deliver, have no evidence of delivery and refused to replace or refund!","Don‚Äôt buy from ASOS! Absolutely appalling customer and service! Ordered over ¬£200 worth of goods which have never been delivered. DPD claim they delivered the parcel to my address to someone called Sam.But I was home at the time of delivery and noone called Sam lives at my address. They then informed me that DPD were revisiting the place of delivery on Friday. Given what they have said they presumably should have come to my house but, of course, no one did. So I would now think they must have gone back to the address it was delivered to and either have the parcel or at very least know which house it was delivered to. Or they have admitted they have lost the parcel. But no they are still claiming the parcel has been delivered but have yet to provide any evidence that the goods have been delivered anywhere, nevermind to me. ASOS have refused replacement or refund which is as good as calling me a liar. I have been an ASOS customer fo mqny years and wasn't requesting a refund, I just wanted the goods I ordered to be delivered. Not an unreasonable request! A quick google search shows both ASOS and DPD do this on a fairly regular basis. Have now had to escalate a claim through Paypal. Will not buy from again! Thieves!"
"May 07, 2019",5,I have been buying from Asos weekly for‚Ä¶,"I have been buying from Asos weekly for the past 5+ years, and I have always received the package, sometimes their delivery time is a bit off but they never guarantee that it will be delivered by that date, it‚Äôs only an estimation and it depends on how busy they are at the time (when they have sales its only logical that it will take more time to despatch orders). My returns are always received and promptly procesed. Custumer service always replies on their chat platform and are always nice and helpful. I really don‚Äôt understand how some people have so many issues with them. Regarding quality of their products, some are good, some are bad, it is a fast fashion brand."
"May 07, 2019",4,Perfect for DD+ bralets,It's so rare to find DD+ bralets that aren't just small/medium/large; so actual bra sizing paired with low prices and really good quality is a breath of fresh air!

Instead it's the day of the due date for delivery and my order is expected to come but 11.59pm how ridiculous.

No compensation offered even though I pay for premier next day delivery (a service which I am not receiving), all was said to me is I can return the item for a refund if it was no longer needed. Come on ASOS, sort out your customer service!!!!"
"May 06, 2019",1,Asos has the worst customer service,"Asos has the worst customer service. I had a package and returned all the items using their prepaid shipping label, and the package got lost. I went to the shipping store and got proof that I sent the package, but because they didn't receive the package they said there was nothing they could do. They wouldn't transfer me to a manager, and just had an automated email sent to me every single time I demanded to speak to a manager on the phone. This was the worst customer service I have ever received and I will never buy from them again."
"May 06, 2019",1,Awful and rude.,"These guys are truly awful in their care for customers. You would expect that such a huge organisation invest more into satisfying their customers - but they really don't. Do not support the company, avoid supporting them until they can improve their customer services. I paid for standard delivery and this stretched beyond 8 days. I contacted them through their inefficient and odd messaging service and i requested details in regards to my items as well as some form of compensation for being unable to deliver my items in the time frame that they provided and that i paid for. They said that there will be no compensation and that in fact the delivery date will be within the NEXT 10 days. It's absolutely awful, I haven't received the products that I have paid for - I'm uninterested and am currently chasing a full refund."
"May 06, 2019",1,Absolutely TERRIBLE.,"Absolutely TERRIBLE.The ""customer service"" was the shadiest interactions I've ever had. They refused to send me to a manager or give me a phone number."
"May 06, 2019",1,Bad customer service,"Besides being an online shop with a lot of variety, they have a terrible customer service which is a deal breaker for me. I have to be honest - most of my orders have arrived without a problem - but when you have an issue, have in mind you'll be wasting your time contacting them.It's probably the worst CS I've ever got - three times I've spoken to them for different issues and they don't seem to care about their customers experience, all they say is: it's on their ""T&Cs"", which at this point I may have to read the whole thing in case it says they can steal money from you.My last issue was regarding a discount weekend they issued, where they offered a different discount according to your spending - I've met their conditions for the greatest amount but then had to return one item - Of course, I understand I don't meet the conditions for the full discount anymore, but was expecting them to honor the lower spending discount (since I meet those conditions).Well, no. If you decide to spend more and for some reason return something, you'll lose any discount, even tho you still meet the conditions.  The worst? They don't care about your experience. They send you the link to their T&Cs and tell you there's nothing they can do (As I'm talking to a robot).They clearly don't listen and show no empathy with their customers. I haven't even been told why they can't honor the promo (in a logical way, not only because of their policy) and they don't see to be looking for a solution for this concern in other to offer better policies for their customers.Disappointed."
"May 06, 2019",1,Who knows when your item will arrive?,Ordered my parcel. It did not arrive. Contacted customer services who advised I would have to wait an extra week on top of the week I'd already waited. Customer services were a joke.
"May 06, 2019",1,SCAM ..,SCAM ... I would give no stars if would allow .  When I returned unwanted items ..via their own label to local post office ..ASOS say have not received parcel . Will not refund without tracking number ... I have lost receipt ..ASOS refer me to post office ..post office refer me to ASOS . ASOS is making money here ... Its not the first time have said item not received.. fortunately last time I had the post office receipt . How many people loose the small peice of paper that acts as a receipt /tracking number ..they are in to a winner !!!! I will NEVER shop with them again .
"May 06, 2019",4,I‚Äôve been shopping with asos since 2007‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôve been shopping with asos since 2007 and I‚Äôve never had a problem they couldn‚Äôt or didn‚Äôt solve. I had bought a RI bag from them and after 6 months of owning it, the item had begun to wear away. I contacted asos and they issued me with a full refund. Only once asos had sent me two different sizes shoes, but luckily I was able to get an exchange. Next day deliveries always arrive. I have the same amazing delivery people each time from DPD and Hermes. My returns have always arrived and been either exchanged or refunded using collectplus tracking. The only thing I will say is that refunds do take some time after the parcel has been returned. But that‚Äôs to be expected. I received a damaged eyeshadow palette along with a brand new one so now I have two minus a yellow shade. I had bought a acne light thingy by Foreo for my cousin that didn‚Äôt work for her. After a week she sent it back and I got my refund. Asos customer service, in my opinion, has been good to me and I will continue to shop with them as they DO! care about their customers."
"May 06, 2019",1,Very badly organised.,"First time of using ASOS, will never use again. Last minute holiday shopping, Sent me a completely wrong size of footwear item out, returned and explained why, issued me a refund(they would not do an exchange even though it was their error) and told to re-order(meaning I would have to pay delivery AGAIN), then told item was out of stock even though website was showing in stock! Very badly organised, would not recommend."
"May 05, 2019",1,Used it once and never shopping here again,"Used it once and never buying anything from them ever . Bought few clothes for a holiday with 2 weeks to spare . Just before the delivery day , ASOS sent me an email saying that delivery was delayed by a day . They then handed it over to Hermes who had no information about where my parcel was . The tracking information wasn‚Äôt updated . Hermes passed me on to ASOS and ASOS back to Hermes . I would never recommend ASOS"
"May 04, 2019",1,If you want an outfit for an event order at least 5 months in advance,"Shocking company with terrible customer service. Kept delaying the day I was suppose to be receiving the product on the date estimated or before. However, Asos proceeded to delay this day time after time again. When ringing to address this issue (several times) they would tell me they can‚Äôt do anything because they don‚Äôt have any contact details with there courier. Ridiculous! Refused to give me a refund for my product. I ordered the product for an event in plenty of time and now I am disappointed and stressed as I do not have the intended outfit for the event at no fault of mine own."
"May 04, 2019",4,GREAT QUALITY PRODUCTS!,"This company's shipping was slow, it took awhile to get my items. When I did get the items I purchased, they were very high quality, not cheaply made like so many of the website's I have ordered from. I will definitely order again from this company!!!!"
"May 04, 2019",1,How can they not have a complaints process!,They sent wrong item and would not refund until this item was in their warehouse.  Over 20 days they held my money for their error.  Online chat is terrible and apparently they no longer have a complaints procedure according to their chat advisor.A truly awful experience.
"May 04, 2019",1,Bad customer service,Bad customer service. They will refund your order without asking or atleast ask for any exchange . Dont shop here beware

"May 03, 2019",1,SCAM! Avoid at all costs!,SCAM! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!SCAM!! The company tells you they did not receive your return and you have to send them ‚Äúproof of postage‚Äù or else hey assume you did not send the return. This is the case even when you use the return shipping label THEY PROVIDED with your order!! I should have done my homework and read reviews before doing business with this company. My order was also weeks later than it should have been.AVOID AT ALL COSTS - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!
"May 03, 2019",1,2 of my last 3 orders were never‚Ä¶,"2 of my last 3 orders were never received! Both orders I paid extra to receive before my events. Neither were delivered. I‚Äôm being told that I have to wait an additional 2 weeks past my promised delivery date before they will take further action (start the refund process) on my missing package. Customer service is horrible. No help whatsoever. I‚Äôm the one that‚Äôs trying to track down package, sending multiple emails and multiple chats. All of this AFTER PAYING FOR UPGRADED SHIPPING! My order is just under $300, so I‚Äôm furious to be out this money and having to replace, at the last minute, clothing needed for an event. I will not order again. Lesson learned."
"May 03, 2019",5,Good,I pay ¬£10 a year for next day delivery and is amazing. However the size guides could be clearer and the quality does depend on the brand you order from there. I‚Äôve never had an issue with anything from asos own brand.
"May 03, 2019",1,Worst experience!,"I would prefer to give no stars at all. Ordered with them on April 8 and returned directly. Nothing happened since. Tracking the parcel states it arrived but no confirmation. When contacting customer service no info available, while I get penalties for not payong an order that I returned. I am very unsatisfied and working in Ecomm I have to say this is a clear how-not-to learning moment. Now extended the payment deadline for 6‚Ç¨ just for them to figure out their returns processes... seriously?!"

"May 03, 2019",3,There are good and bad in the same time,"Clothes quality: It depends what you purchase from them. Delivery:  Theyll deliver your item for next working day if you pay for prime delivery for the whole year. Which is amazing. They have a average customer service.They don‚Äôt give promotions like they used to do before. I always buy lots of clothes shoes for me, family and friends they never sent me any discount codes like some other websites."
"May 02, 2019",5,I got exactly what i needed in the right time...,I was in need of suits and shirt for prom and it got to me in 2 days as expected i was able to track and know where my items were at all times. I recommend this site!
"May 02, 2019",1,Time to shop elsewhere,"After being a regular customer of ASOS for several years I am disappointed by the increasing poor customer service. Paying for the next day delivery I expect that the deliveries will arrive next day but more and frequently I am finding that my order is not reaching me next day. I contacted customer   services and they basically told me that it‚Äôs ok for them to do that as that‚Äôs their policy, with no consideration for me or even an apology. Beside the poor service there is a lack of stock and range of brands as it seems most lines have been removed. Save your self the bother and shop elsewhere"
"May 02, 2019",1,Wow - LOST and DELAYED parcels,"Wow - I have never had issues with ASOS until this week. Out of three parcels, two were delayed (one still is and I don‚Äôt know when to expect it) and one has been LOST. All parcels contained now sold out items purchased with 25% discount that has ended now. Absolutely fuming - they have started using DHL delivery service and this is where the issues come from. Never had a problem when they were using Hermes/DPD. Have been massively put off buying from there and will tell my friends about my experience."
"May 02, 2019",1,Not taking responsibility for mistakes.,"After receiving an order, I had to return some items, mostly to get a new size. A week later I received an email saying that I had been refunded the money, and due to the promo code used, I've only been refunded half the money. I spoke to them on the live chat, the girl seemed nice, but barely helpful at all. I wanted to understand why they refunded me the three items, rather than sending a new size, as required, when it was clearly all in stock. She gave me some BS about the item being out of stock when processed, although it was in stock literally two hours later.Two hours on the live chat resulted in her passing it on to their specialist team, who would email me. Email response has been fairly quick, but each email has been from a new person and all of them completely useless. They are not taking responsibility for their own mistakes and their solution is for me to spend ¬£100 more.Have always been satisfied with ASOS, but this so-called customer care is a massive joke."
"May 02, 2019",5,Always fantastic service and spot on‚Ä¶,Always fantastic service and spot on with delivery and returns.
"May 02, 2019",1,Terrible customer service,"Really difficult to get an answer from anyone, deliveries go missing/don't turn up/are wrong pretty frequently. 'Next day delivery' is rarely next the next day"
"May 02, 2019",1,"Yea, ASOS used to be good - but not anymore","I agree with another person who said they used to be a fan of ASOS. Me too. But the last couple of times I have dealt with them have been extremely disappointing. Either the items were of deplorable quality, fit etc, or the refunds are not given when you send back an item in good faith. And in the last case (that's certainly the last time for me) the item was a warm winter coat with a zipper that doesn't do up. How is that 'fit for purpose'? And getting a refund for the wasted $150? Forget it. Their system didn't even register the purchase in my account, and so they wouldn't give me a returns slip number. I provided all the proof, ie paypal receipt, order number, my id etc, but they just stonewalled me when I tried to get past their BS with facts. What a crazy bunch - if they think they can stay in business that way. I will certainly warn everyone I know that they'd better watch out if anything they order isn't up to scratch - and I think neither ASOS's products nor their returns process is up to scratch. So, basically if you feel like a gamble with your money, buy from ASOS - but if you prefer to know that when you spend money on clothing you are actually going to get what you paid for, then DON'T GO NEAR THEM. Really hopeless and a wonder they're still going really. If I took $150 from someone in the street I would go to jail, but they just get away with it."
"May 02, 2019",1,They should stop pulling out JUST asos‚Ä¶,"They should stop pulling out JUST asos thing, they used to sell more brand once like other ecommerces now it's all awful asos ""extralong"" ""superlong"" ""extracurvy"" oblique, asymmetric, synthetic unwearable stuff. The quality is chinese level. The design is a copy of what is trending, no personality just a cheap site for fashionable kinda highschool kid who wants to appear trendy but buy crappy stuff."

"May 02, 2019",1,Terrible communication,"The one star is because there's no choice for No Star. I have been a fan of ASOS for years but lately, have noticed a difference in customer service and shipping. Recently made a big purchase and qualified for the Free 2 day shipping. Waited and waited but no package arrived. I checked the status again and it was being sent back to the warehouse. While I contacted USPS to get it sorted out, they said the address was wrong therefore it will be sent back to ASOS. Before hanging up, I confirmed the address and it was correct. I attempted to email, chat, facebook message ASOS about the matter -- only to be told there's nothing they can do other than give me a refund. I checked the order, the address is correct. Why is it being sent back without any communication from ASOS or shipping company? Now I am being told I won't get those items back and will have to reorder. The advise they gave is they will refund and if I still want them I'd need to re-purchase the items again. WT. F. Those items are not even available anymore. Why on earth would you run an online retail shop with bad shipping procurement and bad communication?! Honestly, I love the variety of what ASOS has to offer, but this low level of customer service and unable to deliver what was purchased is a huge letdown."
"May 01, 2019",3,Hermes is the only issue,"The app is easy to use and they always have amazing offers! The clothes are good quality and also the brand variety is overwhelming.In uk the only issue with ASOS orders is the Hermes courier that they work with and every single time they delay, drop the parcel elsewhere even if your are home all day waiting for it or worse email you that the parcel has been delivered when you haven‚Äôt even signed for anything! It happened twice to me and for this reason I stopped ordering from ASOS and I also offer 3 stars! If they close the contract of delivering that they have with Hermes I‚Äôm sure people will start appreciating them more!"
"May 01, 2019",5,Ordering via the App is nice and easy‚Ä¶,"Ordering via the App is nice and easy and delivery by their appointed courier happens when they say it will.Would recommend, and surprised to read others have had poor experiences."
"May 01, 2019",1,What‚Äôs happened to ASOS!,"I have been a customer of ASOS since they started. Up until before Xmas I would have given them 5 stars as I couldn‚Äôt fault them. However, in the last 4 months I‚Äôve not had one order delivered on time, as a consequence of them moving from DPS as their preferred courier. I‚Äôve had one order delivered with items missing , and another where one item had clearly been worn and another was damaged. This is not ASOS as I know them. They offer a great range  and reasonable pricing however everything else is currently letting them down. They‚Äôve lost me as a customer and I never thought I‚Äôd say that. Shame ASOS."
"May 01, 2019",1,Disgusting email from ASOS,"My wife opened an ASOS account and bought a gift token as a birthday present for a young relative. Our credit card supplier confirms that the cost of the token was approved on our card. ASOS then cancelled the order and closed my wife's account. When she phoned to ask, why she was told they couldn't answer by phone but would send an email.It arrived today, addressed, rather disgustingly, to ""NoValue NoValue"" and includes this model of customer care...====Hello, After an assessment of your account, we‚Äôve taken the decision to keep your ASOS account closed.ASOS have made the decision not to accept any further orders from you. If any orders are placed, they will be cancelled.As we‚Äôre unable to help you further, any emails received about this matter will be automatically closed down with no response. Best wishes=====BEST WISHES? What after that insulting sloping shoulders example of disgusting customer care..."
"May 01, 2019",1,Delayed delivery,Delayed delivery. Poor customer service. Was not even close to being helpful. no tracking information available even when I asked customer service for it. They just told me it's in transit and told me to contact them if I haven't received the item IN THE NEXT MONTH. Absolute disgrace.
"May 01, 2019",1,Bad delivery service and customer service !,"Very very bad delivery service amd customer service ,my order is been missing , and they do not want to replace the order or to give me my money back !! And i spend more then 100¬£ , they do not have respect for their customers !"
"May 01, 2019",1,Absolutely terrible customer service,"Absolutely terrible customer service. I ordered a leather jacket two weeks ago and this has not been dispatched and no update but they took payment. No one seems to care, just pass queries to a specialist team who don‚Äôt respond. Avoid at all costs."
"May 01, 2019",1,I am very disappointed with ASOS,"I am very disappointed with ASOS. I used to love them, however I returned $200 worth of clothes over 2 weeks ago and they still did not receive it. The tracking numbers given say invalid with both USPS and UPS. It‚Äôs absurd. They do keep track of their own return labels it seems. It‚Äôs sad if these packages are just sitting somewhere and $200 down the drain."
"April 30, 2019",1,Shocking customer service,"Shocking customer service, paid for premium delivery for a year and after one use it was never available on my account again. After numerous emails and different unhelpful staff i am still nowhere closer to being able to access my premium delivery."
"April 30, 2019",5,"Big variety, good prices and cheap quick delivery","We have been shopping from Asos store online for a few years. Pleased with good sales, there is a lot to choose from. We once received a wrong item and returns were very easy from Lithuania to UK, and it didn't cost. Received the correct item pretty fast too. And you know sending items back is one of the most annoying things to do...great when things can be done easily.We always appreciate the free delivery to Lithuania option, as Asos has some nice items that are worth to take a look (and for a good price)."
"April 30, 2019",1,Messed up delivery...again,"I recently purchased an item from ASOS using my premier account so I could have next day delivery for some work clothes needed for a new job, got an email on the day of delivery saying it wouldn‚Äôt be delivered so I went on live chat and was told they weren‚Äôt able to look into it until the following day, which would be too late, so I questioned why they couldn‚Äôt contact the driver and was told they couldn‚Äôt do that because there was still time for it to arrive and then they abruptly ended the chat before I could reply and without resolving my issue. I called up after spending a good amount of time trying to find a contact number since they don‚Äôt have it on their website and make it very difficult to speak with them, and was told that the delivery van had broken down (not what I was previously told) and that once the parcel has changed hands with Hermes delivery there is no way to contact them?! I asked why they couldn‚Äôt contact and find out if it could still be delivered and was told it‚Äôs in their contract with Hermes that they can‚Äôt speak to the delivery driver once they have the parcel...so they aren‚Äôt allowed to contact the company that they pay for their service? I then emailed ASOS and was told that they had tried to deliver my item and nobody was home, there were several people home and we have CCTV to prove that nobody tried to deliver the items, but apparently the photo sent as proof of delivery of a blurred black screen is better evidence than our CCTV ü§î so I‚Äôve been told 3 different versions of why my parcel wasn‚Äôt delivered and was offered rude and unhelpful customer service, this is on top of countless parcels being left on my front door step and then stolen or left in dustbins, and even seeing delivery drivers go past my house without stopping and then saying that nobody was home to sign for it. 0/10 for customer service and delivery"
"April 30, 2019",1,dreadful customer service,"Dreadful customer service.  I ordered 12 days ago and I still don't have my item.  I know there was a bank holiday so that could account for it being a little later but seriously 12 day?  Every time I get in touch they tell me 'their specialist team is looking into it'. I really want the item but if they haven't gotten back to me soon then i'll be asking for a refund. I see my item is 'out of stock' online so guessing they don't have the guts to tell me it's a stock issue. The customer care on chat is hopeless, they can't tell me anything and send automated messages it appears."
"April 30, 2019",1,Awful if ordering outside of Europe,"I've purchased many times from Asos whilst I was living in Europe, mainly in the UK. Never had issues there, returns were easy, did not cost me money to send it back, delivery was quick and refund was settled promptly. I ordered from Asos in Canada. I was charged customs fee which literally doubled the cost of my dresses, this was not outlined or stated on the website. Being new in Canada, I had no idea that this fee is flat rate (>$50) regardless of the price of your goods as long as it exceeds $20. To make it worse, the dresses I ordered did not fit me despite using the size guide. Their clothing always run too big. I normally wear UK8-10. Nowhere in store, have I ever bought smaller sizes. On Asos, I have to scale down several sizes even when I use the sizing assistant and I answered based on actual measurements/weight. The fit is also clearly off, because every so often, if I order a couple dresses which are all the same size, one might fit while the others run down my knees. My sequin dress is dropping sequins every now and then. I've had to vacuum it up and even then there's still a couple falling off whenever it is shifted. I tried to find the loose thread and just cannot locate it cause it's black.The worst part is to return to the UK, I will be charged a shipping fee of $22+. This means, the cost of shipping and customs alone would have easily gotten me 3 dresses without the added hassle of purchasing it from overseas and having issues with sizing and having to return it. Really terrible. Do not purchase from Asos unless you live in the UK. I just missed London and hated the clothing/fashion in Canada. Can't believe this just made everything worse."
"April 29, 2019",1,Terrible,Terrible. Always in a rush and provide generic/robotic answers. Starts off well but then they try and close the chat when they can't provide a  resolution.
"April 29, 2019",1,Not about their customers,"My experiences have been mixed but, on the whole, I would describe their company as very customer ‚Äòunfriendly‚Äô.They pass the buck at every opportunity and take absolutely no responsibility for delivery issues. You cannot run an online business with that kind of attitude."
"April 29, 2019",2,I would advise people to be very wary‚Ä¶,"I would advise people to be very wary of ordering expensive items on this site, especially trainers etc.As most of us order online I would expect a much better service. I ordered a pair of  ¬£100 trainers for my son who is 13, as part of a present. He is paying half ¬£50 that he has saved for weeks from a paper round. They were guaranteed next day delivery. Still not arrived 2 weeks later. Asos are very good at given their patter that they are looking into it and DHL are investigating. I have 8 reassuring generic emails that it is being looked into.What they are very stupid at not realising is that unless they rectify problems QUICKLY they will loose customers, not just me but younger generations that feel disgusted that a company acts like this. As a company that is  online and has no customer telephone number (which is ludicrous) I would be very cautious at ordering from them. My advise if you can get else where guaranteed delivery for a day go with that. I do not believe that they have a full process in place for order problems. I have worked as a Buyer in an international retail environment, and am fully aware problems happen. Remember Asos you only get remembered for bad experiences not good so these need to be dealt with to keep customer loyalty. As a retailer online no matter how good your stock is ASOS REMEMBER THERE IS NO ASOS WITHOUT CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMER SERVICE SHOULD BE YOUR PRIORITY.  Please everyone preserve with any monies owed as I will and if no response I will be going through small claims court out of principle if not resolved.Update is they finally got back after about 3 weeks to say trainers were out of stock then waited another week for refund. Not good to take customers money then not have goods ASOS sort it out!"
"April 29, 2019",5,Great customer service,"I ordered some shoes and a makeup item, when the delivery came I only had the shoes. I went to the online chat room to see if they were coming in separate packages, the person on the other end said they were supposed to be in the same one and that they were very sorry it was not. They shipped the makeup out to me and I got it the next day!! Great service, very apologetic, great to talk to and quick resolution!"
"April 29, 2019",1,Worst Customer Sevice! Buyers beware!,"The clothes are cute.  Decent structure for the price.  But the customer service is HORRIBLE! I made a large purchase on 3/5, sent the return back 3/12 and Inhave yet to recieve my money back! There's no customer service number, I have yet to get a response from my email and each time I try to chat with a representative....the connection is ""disconneted."" I will be reaching out to BBB.  Dont waste your time! Online companies like Asos is exactly why Im so hesistant to shop online."
"April 27, 2019",4,I think Asos is great,"I have bought loads of things from ASOS - most of my wardrobe - and they are a great service. I find it  really easy to return unwanted products, with quick refunds and they have such a range that I can usually get exactly what I‚Äôm looking for at a good price. I have only once had trouble with them - an order (one of many) came maybe 3 days late, but when I contacted them they gave me updates and were had very good customer service."
"April 27, 2019",1,Getting a refund from this company is‚Ä¶,Getting a refund from this company is worse than pulling teeth. Ordered a bathing suit top and bottom and received someone else's entire order (6 items in a completely different size). Returned it the next day. One month later and I still have nothing despite contacting them 3+ times. Tracking shows they received my return 24 days ago. I'm baffled that they are allowed to conduct business like this. I've only made 3 purchases from this company but there's no way I'll be doing any more business with them. No wonder they're losing money.
"April 27, 2019",5,I have ordered from Asos several times‚Ä¶,"I have ordered from Asos several times - I live in Canada and I usually pay for express shipping. I forgot to this time and it took around 3 weeks to arrive. It was two days later than the expected delivery date, but everything was great and fit perfectly!I live near a major shipping hub (Toronto) so often my deliveries are faster than if I were to live in the suburbs.Asos customer service were able to get back to me within a day when I asked about the status of my order. Honestly I have not had a problem with them yet - even when I had to return an item. So I don't know if people on here are really impatient or what.If you live in Canada and order standard shipping, around a month is normal waiting time. Always buy things online with a credit card so you can dispute it, if it really takes too long."
"April 27, 2019",1,Terrible customer service,"Terrible customer service. They don‚Äôt answer the questions you ask. Returned an item and they lied on my refund receipt, giving me less than I paid. Awful company."
"April 26, 2019",1,The worst customer Services,The worst customer Services. I would never recommend or use them again. Unwilling to help and rude. I‚Äôve had a bad experience on more than one occasion. Better to spend your money on a proper company rather than waste your money on Asos who clearly don‚Äôt care about there customers
"April 26, 2019",1,zero star,"seriously, one star is too much."
"April 26, 2019",1,Bad customer service,First time I need there customer service and they don‚Äôt answer your questions! They just send the exact same mail over and over again... soo frustrating. Bad customer service!
"April 26, 2019",1,They do not track their return labels‚Ä¶,They do not track their return labels and I sent back $500 worth of clothing never to be seen again! absolute scam!
"April 26, 2019",1,I ordered from asos but never received‚Ä¶,"I ordered from asos but never received it, and many times i contact them and all they answer was wait till this day that day,very poor customer service and never order from asos."
"April 26, 2019",1,Horrible customer service,"Horrible customer service. You pay for their premier service which is supposed to allow you to have next day deliveries but the deliveries don‚Äôt turn up, they give out fake tracking numbers and they have a No Compensation policy to rectify any mistakes on their part. Not worth the hassle shopping with them. One order ends up being a case undelivered items and at least 20 emails going back and forth. Diabolical !!"
"April 26, 2019",1,Absolutely disgusting customer service,Absolutely disgusting customer service. They are not interested in rewarding loyal customers. Something goes wrong and no one cares. I have been without money and without my order for 2 weeks since dpd lost it. Asos would not give me a refund and now tell me I have to wait another 2 weeks for my refund. 4 weeks without my money or my items. Despicable.
"April 26, 2019",1,Worst customer support ever!,"The worst customer support ever! Don't buy here cause If you do and problems occure, there's just no way to complain. Customer care is just non existant here, emails remain unreplied and employees working at the chat line just lock you out of the chat again when incapable to resolve the issue, so you just end up wasting your time!"
"April 26, 2019",1,Worst customer service I have ever experienced!!,"I ordered over ¬£100 worth of clothes from asos for a mini getaway 4 days later. I have ordered with Asos countless times with no issues but this time round I had a text from DPD to say they were going to deliver and to provide instructions of a safe place should I not be in. I did so and asked them to leave it in my shed which is self locking and has CCTV pointed directly at it as it is where all of our deliveries are left. A couple of hours later I received another text to say it was delivered and left as instructed. I followed the link to see a photo taken by the delivery driver of it left in a completely different place, not safe and in front of a main road. I was at work at the time and could not get to the parcel so the only thing I could do was message my neighbour to get them to pick it up for me. Unfortunately my neighbour was out and upon arriving home and realised the parcel was no longer there. I contacted Asos immediately and via their chat as apparently you can not call them and ""online is what they do best"" which was what I was told countless times and couldn't be further from the truth. I was told they would speak to DPD and email when they had heard back. I provided them with a picture of the confirmation text to confirm they would leave it in the shed and the picture the driver had sent me of it at my front door. I then received an email from Asos to say that they had investigated it and DPD have confirmed it was left where I had asked them so I would not be getting my order or my money back. I then had 6 different chats where each time I sent them the photo's confirming that they had not left it where instructed and that the delivery driver would of had to physically walk past my shed to leave it by my front door, on a busy main road. I was continuously told that because I because I had asked them to leave it in my shed, despite them leaving it somewhere else completely, that it was my fault and I had to accept responsibility as well as lose out on over ¬£100. I spoke to multiple people on Facebook, each time I had a response to my messages it was a different person and each person said something that contradicted the other. I was asked to give my phone number so someone could call me and then in the next message was told by a different person that a call was not possible. I was left waiting an hour between messages and in the end I had to go through google and found a number to call that put me through to someone who finally helped with my issue. It has been four days now and DPD are on their 5th investigation despite me continuously providing them with evidence that THEY had sent me and I am under the impression that if the order was less than ¬£100 I would definitely not be getting my order/money back.How a company so big and well known can have such an awful customer service process I don't know. My customer journey has been so frustrating I was reduced to tears and I have essentially gone round in circles for the last four days. 7/8 chats, countless Facebook messages and 35 minutes on the phone later and I still have no hope at all that I will ever be seeing my goods/money back."
"April 26, 2019",1,MEGAN @ Customer Service straight up lied to me.,"I have placed lots of orders with ASOS over the years and the worst I'd experienced was slow refund time. Recently (2019) however, ASOS has gone from bad to worse and I wouldn't even recommended them at all now.Possibly the rudest customer service I have ever received.ASOS advertise prices in one place, then when you get the site you have to watch because the prices usually increase. e.g. advertised at ¬£25 > click the link to go to the item > increases to ¬£32.ASOS told me they would honor prices when there are errors but they don't.MEGAN their customer service rep, gave me a scripted response about it being the fault of my 'internet cookies'... bare in mind I am an IT Professional, but I humored her and tried it anyway. When I told her the problem still existed and explained this wouldn't fix it, she gave me another story about broken links.When I could see she didn't have a clue what she was talking about, I asked to escalate to a manager/higher up. She said 'no I've already solved your issue' then ended the chat so I couldn't reply.This is possibly the WORST customer service I have ever received from MEGAN at ASOS.I have since been in contact with ASOS Managing Director and am taking the steps to escalate this issue."
"April 26, 2019",1,Didn't receive my order so contacted‚Ä¶,"Didn't receive my order so contacted customer service to find out where is it, via chat, biggest mistake ever !!! I was contacted with Beth who didn't give me any information apart from that specialist needs to look into it, made me wait another 24 hrs without any info and disconnected with me !!!! What kind of specialist ?? Really? You need a specialist to contact DPD and find out where is my order ?!Where are your customer service skills???? How can you disconnect a chat that customer started without sorting out the issue or at least trying?? How can you finish the chat before the customer is happy with the outcome??"
"April 26, 2019",1,Bad customer service,Bad customer service. My order wasn‚Äôt gonna come in time but they still gave me a refund when I didn‚Äôt ask for it..
"April 25, 2019",1,Do yourself a favor and do NOT buy from ASOS,"Please do not buy from this company. They do not care for their costumers at all and you will end up extremely frustrated. I was a missing an item from one of my orders and instead of actually helping me solve the issue they closed my account and told me that all emails from me would be closed without response. I have been a costumer for years and I didn't get any help at all. I had to turn to DHL where they were able to locate the missing item which I then returned to ASOS but they did not refund. The tracking number states that they recieved the return on April 2 but they refuse to give me a straight answer when I show them the evidence. They don't even address the evidence, they only send me automatic responses. They have these lame templates that they use which makes the costumer service experience far from personal. One person says it's still being processed while another tells me they recieved it in the wrong ""channel"" and that they have different process for different countries and mine ended up in the wrong one and when it is being sent to a ""specialist team"" all I get is that my account is closed and no claims can be done, even though they have told me twice that my right to return and get refunded accordingly will be respected despite that they closed my account.I have never in my life felt so offended by a company and I hope they will get what they deserve in the end. What they are doing is violating so many laws I can't even begin to tell you. I have reported the company further and I hope other people who have been wrongfully treated will do the same."
"April 25, 2019",1,Total lack of transparency in delivery options,"So very very disappointed. It‚Äôs my daughter‚Äôs birthday at weekend. She picked clothes from ASOS. I paid my subscription for premier delivery ( next day delivery ). I placed order. On the screen it said in bold black box that my premier delivery was ACTIVE. Parcel hasn‚Äôt arrived - I checked the order - won‚Äôt get it until next week. Contacted ASOS - my fault as apparently I needed to over ride the automatic delivery option default at time of check out  ( it defaults to free standard delivery - which is very slow - 7 days!) They won‚Äôt upgrade delivery option via customer helpline. I got told to reorder whole order and pay better attention to instructions at checkout, and just to return the other order which will arrive late. Just tried that - I can see no easy way to over ride the default. I can‚Äôt believe they are getting away with a system so lacking in transparency. I can‚Äôt be the only one caught out by this deliberately poor checkout system."
"April 25, 2019",1,suit jacket fiasco,i ordered a suit jacket from here with next day delivery. what came was the trousers to go with the jacket instead. i emailed to ask for them to exchange but the jacket is now out of stock. they have been completely unhelpful and have not offered any solutions to the problem or a way to get me the jacket i have payed for.
"April 25, 2019",1,Wrong item received,"Paid premium delivery for an item I needed this weekend because I thought I would be making more purchases. I received my order next day but I received a completely different item to what I wanted, just in the same size and colour. When checking online to re-order in time for the weekend the item is out of stock. Seems they‚Äôve tried to send me something similar just to see if I would settle..."
"April 25, 2019",4,Never had an issue with ASOS,"Never had an issue with ASOS, will continue to order from them"
"April 25, 2019",1,DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE,"Worst customer service ever!!!!! I was supposed to receive my order a week ago but never got it, so I emailed them. They told me to contact my post office to see if I could track it down, and once that had been done, to wait three more weeks before getting back in touch with them. Three weeks is quite unreasonable in my opinion, so I waited a week and explained that I didn't think this was fair. The last thing I wanted was for the order to be forgotten about. They told me I still needed to wait the full three weeks before contacting them again. Terrible customer service considering my order was already delayed. This was my first time ordering from ASOS and definitely will not be ordering again."
"April 25, 2019",5,My favourite shop,My favourite shop. Love how helpful they are and help with any problems.
"April 25, 2019",2,ASOS rules but process does not,"I love asos, the convenience is second to none, and the customer support is very good at responding. However I have recently started purchasing asos branded shoes and a pair of brogues had the entire heel fall off after 8 days. The cost was ¬£55.Support have advised that a refund or replacement is not possible without a return, even though photographic evidence has been provided.Sadly this means for a period of time I am brogueless on top of having a day wearing wonky shoes."
"April 25, 2019",5,ASOS is great,"Here I am, trying to fix this negative publication bias (only people who had a negative experience write a review here).The clothes came to the Netherlands withing 2 working days after I ordered. The live tracking of DPD is very precise, and I got a chance to catch the delivery guy to try my new clothes straight away.  2 out of 3 dresses didn't fit (they were too small, UK size 2. This never happened to me before because I'm tiny). I sent them back and got a full refund 9 days after.Asos is a great and reliable company, don't be scared by all the negative reviews."

Got a promo for free 2-day express shipping, but they gave me standard shipping when I got the confirmation email.When I got on the chat to ask them to switch this, the first agent had said my email that I gave was wrong and immediately ended the chat without even letting me respond. I only have 1 email address, and thought maybe I misspelled it, so I copy/paste it and put it in the message that I'm sure my email is right, and that I received my order confirmation on it and that my ASOS account is linked to my Google account and that's how I sign in.The second agent said it was wrong, and I told her to double check because I was positive it was right! She told me to hold on and wait, and never came back.Left me hanging close to the 1-hour window to be over to cancel my order. Decided to stop waiting and just cancel my order right away. Complete rubbish."

"April 24, 2019",5,Amazing customer service!,I am honestly shocked to see so many negative reviews for ASOS. I order allot from ASOS and the delivery time is always amazing. On two occasions I have had problems and both times I contacted them on live chat and a replacement was with me the next day.

Emails go unanswered and live chat is the worst service I have ever encountered. I have been waiting 1 week for an order which I paid extra for next day delivery. I have been on live chat 5 times, every time, they tell me to get back in contact the next day and then end the chat. Appalling company."

I purchased a bag for my husband for Christmas and having only used it a few months, it broke, so needed to return it. Initially, I was messaging someone at ASOS to explain my issue. I was then sent a returns label and returned the bag via collect plus. I received my refund, no questions asked. I received timely communication from ASOS and the entire sake and return was hassle free. I will always use ASOS and never once had a problem with their services."

"April 23, 2019",1,I will NEVER order from ASOS again,"I will NEVER order from ASOS again. NEVER. I had ordered from them years ago without a problem, but this time they basically have stolen hundreds of dollars from me. I returned two dresses because the fit was so awkward. I used their pre-paid address label. Weeks later, they have not refunded me because they say they never got the merchandise back. They have asked me for tracking information - but I used their label so they should have the tracking information. I did an on-line chat with the rudest person alive at their web site and I still have no refund. They refuse to track their own shipping label and just keep asking me for the information.

"April 23, 2019",1,DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY,"DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY! I had previously ordered from this company on several occasions, however I will never again. I have had an ongoing dispute with ASOS since July 2018 and it still is not resolved. They have scammed me for ¬£545.00. I ordered several items from them on June 30th and when they delivered my parcel no one was at home, so rather than leaving a note to re-arrange the delivery or leaving it at the post office they left it with my neighbour without my permission. Firstly this is against consumer rights. Secondly I received no text/ note to let me know my parcel was left with my neighbour, until my neighbour knocked on my door to give me the parcel. When I received the parcel from my neighbour, firstly it was a lot smaller than I had expected and secondly items were missing. Now I trust my neighbour and the package was fully sealed, therefore I know my neighbour had not taken any items but my most expensive items were not delivered. I had received goods worth ¬£55 and the remaining items were missing. I have called ASOS several items about this, I have contacted my bank and raised a dispute, however ASOS refused to give the money bank. I have also spoken to Citzen's advise and sent ASOS letters and emails with no reply. This company is the worst to order from, they claim they have closed my case and no one will speak/ answer me. I would highly recommend not ordering from them and I have never dealt with such an unprofessional, scam company in my entire life!"
"April 23, 2019",1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS WEBSITE !,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS WEBSITE !DO NOT BUY FROM THIS WEBSITEI want to warn all buyers out there that something is wrong with this company. I returned my package using their prepaid return label and never received the refund. About $150! They told me that it is my fault and they did not bother to help me because I should have take a copy of the return label. They even tried to put the blame on the UPS place where I dropped off my package. I later l learned that a lot of people are having the same issue. PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT FALL INTO THEIR SCAM LIKE I DID. I wish someone can put a stop into this so they can not steal money from another person.
"April 21, 2019",4,Usually perfect :(,Usually perfect :(Ordered 3 items from Asos and 1 was missing.

Waited in all day and then checked to see where my package was and saw it was on the way back to the warehouse üò°. They said it was refused delivery ,which is complete nonsense. If they tried to deliver it then why no note through my door? I then contacted customer service on chat and the lady was completely incompetent. She apologised saying these things happen but refused to send my package back. Still waiting on a refund for my things!! I will never order from ASOS again. Such a shame as I use to use them a lot and they were quite good at delivery, returns etc...  looking at the reviews on ASOS they are doing this sort of thing a lot. I won‚Äôt be ordering from here ever again and have warned my friends and family not to also."

"April 21, 2019",2,Poor customer service,"I ordered an item on the 12th April and received multiple emails informing me that my item had been despatched. I never received the item nor an email confirming that my parcel had been delivered. This morning I woke up to another email from ASOS claiming that they had received my item and my refund would be processed over the next 10 working days. Confused, I contacted customer services using live chat. I explained the situation to which the customer service representative responded ‚Äúyour order has been refunded and you will receive payment on the 21st April.‚ÄùAgain, I explained that I had not even received the parcel. Instead of apologising the representative merely explained that the delivery driver may have not been able to locate my address, which is utterly ridiculous considering my office is in a large building in central London with a 24 hour reception desk. I asked if the representative could resend me the dress to which she informed me she could not and I would have to go back through the website to do this. What a complete shambles. No apology, incompetent staff and a frustrated regular customer."
"April 21, 2019",1,Selected incorrect address,"Selected incorrect address, only realised this when the order was out for delivery, attempted to update the address with DPD though was unable to. So got in touch with them on Facebook, kept asking me to return the order or how to amend the address when the order has been placed. Asked a friend to collect the parcel though wasn't there and now trying to resolve this on email as I've no parcel and lost over ¬£100. What a Joke!"
"April 21, 2019",1,ASOS only cares about virtue signaling‚Ä¶,"ASOS only cares about virtue signaling how inclusive they are yadi yadi, half of their non basics clothing is tailored towards non hetrosexual women and men.. that's just fine but to be sending out wrong sizes and have a customer service that's filled with robots.. It's a shambles of a company. I don't think the individual workers are at fault but it seems to me ASOS only cares about feelings of ppl visiting their website with their hyper inclusiveness instead of what their customers actually deserve. Avoid these amateurs."
"April 20, 2019",1,shoddy service,"Brand-new to this brand, I received my package it had a hole in it. It was left outside for rain to fill.

I was incredibly excited to get these in the mail, considering I‚Äôve always heard good things about ASOS clothing. I got it in the mail in a timely fashion and opened and tried everything on immediately. The necklace I ordered, came broken. There was absolutely no clasp attachment. The dress fit well, but it was completely see through. I‚Äôm incredibly disappointed in the quality for the price I paid ($45 for dress) ($10 for necklace). This company should be disappointed in sending customers this terrible quality of clothing. An absolute rip off. Never would recommend or buy from again. Save yourself the pain of returning it."

I have a wedding in a week and the stated guaranteed delivery date was before or on April 18, 2019. I repeatedly stated I need this dress for a wedding on April 27 and I only ordered it because of the guaranteed arrival date given. Beth was the one helping me and kept saying they'll look into AFTER May 8. I asked her several times to do me a favor and if it's possible to look into it now to see if it's possible that I'll get it before the event date which is April 27, if they look into it after May 8 I won't even need the dress!! I'm so upset and so dissappointed with the service I've recieved. She then ended the chat without letting me finish what I had to say. Poor, poor service. I will no longer order through them and I've been a Long Time customer but this just ruined it for me."
"April 19, 2019",1,AWFUL DELIVERY SERVICE!!,AWFUL DELIVERY SERVICE!!! Order never come on time.

"April 19, 2019",1,Awful,"Awful, ASOS worked not just because of their range but customer service, but that is now slipping hard.I pay for next day delivery and they have clearly made changes to their supply chain because I've not received my order next day twice. The updates are shocking you used to get a text giving you an hour's slot now you have to be available 8-10pm. It's like going back 20 years! Then their customer support keeps telling you their system says it will be delivered next day, meaning they are either calling you a liar or dpd are misleading them. When you try to explain that, you literally get a computer says no response. Basically sit in all day on your Saturday and if it doesn't come, contact us. Wait for the crime to happy even if dpd have sent me written confirmation that it won't be delivered next day. Absolute joke, the failed delivery is one thing, incompetent staff is another."

"April 19, 2019",1,Ordered an outfit,"Ordered an outfit, followed the tracking which confirmed delivery when it didn't arrive I contacted Asos who basically said it would take another 12 days because of public holidays! Since it was already with the courier I could not understand why 12 days and no one could satisfactorily explain it to me.In addition it appears they do not have a complaints department or procedure. Appalling service, will not be using them again and will make sure all my friends know what an appalling service I have had"
"April 19, 2019",1,Asos care?,‚ÄúThe worst‚Äù customer service and very disorganize of all online shop Ive had. Even the online shop from China is way way better than this company. Such a disgrace knowing that they are so called multi million company retailer. Awful! never again!
"April 18, 2019",1,Avid ASOS shopper no more,"I am livid!I I shop on ASOS A LOT over the past years and I spend quite a bit for each order at a time. The past two years I feel like they have been going downhill. I received items extremely late, damaged items and incorrect items. This past order I return everything (due to receiving a wrong item and poor quality clothing) and shipped it out using their label. Mind you, whenever a company has provided me a label, I can typically email them and ask them for tracking info since they keep the return tracking number on file. Not for ASOS. I passed my package off to my mailman (so I did not receive a receipt) and three weeks later here I am waiting for a refund. I contacted them and they pretty much told me we need to see the receipt. My question to them, do you not keep track of the labels that you issue to your customers where you can pull it up? Their response, it's a free label, you need to get a receipt. Okayyyy. Well some people can't go to the post office and get a receipt. I asked to speak to a manager and they told me that they would say the same thing to me and ended the chat immediately. Safe to say, I am no longer shopping with them ever again and plan to shop with their competitors."
"April 18, 2019",1,Extremely Bad Customer Service,"I placed a order for next day delivery which did not arrive. In the morning I noticed that I didn‚Äôt have tracking details or email so I contacted support who told me it was out for delivery. In fact I spoke to them 3 times as I was concerned about the lack of tracking, all said it would be with me even though I told them I didn‚Äôt have confirmation or the tracking option. Of course, it didn‚Äôt arrive. So I contacted support at 10pm, that‚Äôs what the last person told me to do. All I received was saved responses that didn‚Äôt even make sense and that I had been sent from other agents earlier in the day. No offer of help or solution, I was told it‚Äôs due to arrive on 18th so to get in touch then. It is the 18th! Apparently I have to wait until 23:59 to report my order has not arrived! How ridiculous! One reply even said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad I could help‚Äù when my previous message said that she hadn‚Äôt event offered me any help at all. Lydia was the person on chat, she just wanted to get rid of me until after her shift had finished. I‚Äôm never ordering from ASOS again and I will tell everybody I know not to bother with them either. Disgraceful customer service and totally unreliable delivery"
"April 18, 2019",1,Received a parcel from them recently,"Received a parcel from them recently, it arrived and everything was percent, but they forgot to actually tape the parcel! It was wide open!! I am absolutely appalled, not only by this but by their customer service too. All I am getting are automated replies, telling me they scrictly follow procedures ( what a joke), and that I can just send it back and get a refund. A week before this I placed a different order with them and received the wrong sized item. So furious, I will never be shopping with them again."
"April 18, 2019",2,ASOS could be a very good company but‚Ä¶,"ASOS could be a very good company but they seriously need to work on their processing. I've paid for the premier delivery annual subscription which is supposed to mean your orders made before 12 o'clock is delivered the next day. I made an order on the 10/04 before midday, I was given the estimated delivery as the 11/04, a notification from DPD that it will be delivered. Then another saying it will be here on the 12th. A day after my daughter's birthday which the item was part of her gift. Today is the 18th. Guess what, it's still not here. No email was sent. When tracked the notification from DHL states that there was no delivery details. I contacted ASOS on their chat and was told the driver couldn't find my house despite living on a road with six other hours with my house number largely displayed on the wall. This never happens with any other company I use when using the same delivery service except when it's coming from ASOS. I'm not even sure what courier they use!!"
"April 18, 2019",1,"Error in their system, won't alter destination. Unacceptable.","Company would not alter destination address that was incorrectly selected because their systems screwed up. Item is shipping to an address that I no longer reside even though I entered a new address, and will not alter the order in any way. There are more than a couple reviews that have had this kind of issue. It's pretty obvious that the 5 star reviews are all BS. No customer service # to call."
"April 18, 2019",5,I‚Äôm so confused by the bad reviews,"I‚Äôm so confused by the bad reviews! Have been using Asos for years and it has always been good and keeps getting better. I have had the odd issue-one or two late deliveries and twice when a wrong item has been sent BUT that is probably 1% of all the orders I have made. I order constantly and the app is so easy to use. Tracks my delivery. Returns are the easiest ever-even small things like resealable bags, tick boxes for returns, quick refunds etcThe variety of items is brilliant! It‚Äôs not often I can‚Äôt find what I want from self tan to river island jeans. Anyone would think I work for Asos lol But honestly, I don‚Äôt understand how anyone can have a problem with them unless I have been extremely lucky which I can‚Äôt imagine considering just how much I order."

How can it be that hard, one time perhaps but on five consecutive orders. Come on ASOS get it together. Will not be shopping there again."
"April 18, 2019",1,Useless company all round!,"Useless company all round. It is shocking that in 2019, when most companies with an online presence have guaranteed next day delivery ASOS still cannot manage to deliver items within a three day time frame!!!!! I will not be purchasing from this company again as I cannot justify to myself spending two whole days sitting at home waiting for a delivery when I could have bought similar items from more reliable companies."
"April 18, 2019",1,Asos refuses to refund for their own mistake,"Asos has always advertised their easy returns. That's a whole load of crap.I made a purchase of $220. Sent back 3 items (1 was a complete wrong order, 2 didn't fit and was ugly as heck), they did not even inform me that they received my return parcel or anything. 2 over months later, I contact them and stay said they received it a month ago, but are not refunding me because of their ""T&C"". I understood if they weren't refunding for the two ugly ones, since I supposedly had overlooked the T&C for the promotion I used. But they refused to refund for their mistake too, continuously citing ""T&C"". That's complete bs. I didn't get what I ordered. That should be grounds enough for a refund. But no. They phrase their sly T&C in a way that covers their a** when they make a mistake too. So now I lost my items, lost money, and completely lost faith in a company I've been supporting for 6 years now.If you're smart, you'd do the same. Absolutely trash aftercare. They just want your money."

Until I was sent a see-through maternity dress that  had apparent blood stain on the back and the wrong ring. I sent the package back, and I never got a refund. I was bluntly denied a refund after reaching out to customer service reps who just stopped talking and waited for me to leave the chat. So in the end, I not only did not get the items I wanted, I also had to pay for them. Other issues I had with ASOS latel include not getting confirmations and notifications via email and not getting packages on time despite my 2-day shipping yearly subscription. I guess I'll take my money elsewhere."
"April 16, 2019",1,Terrible customer service given to a repeat customer,"Really disappointing customer service. Sent a T shirt back. They a flat refusing to refund. Awful call centre robots that don‚Äôt want to help. Won‚Äôt be using again. I probably spend about ¬£1500 pa online clothes shopping with a good amount going to themUPDATEDthis company is a joke. I would strongly urge you not to use them. After battling for a couple of weeks & pretty much being accused of fraud they have refunded me. I have been spoken to like to child, have multiple online chats, exchanged emails & had to call them. Inept staff, rigid rules that only benefit themselves & time consuming processes for any returns that go wrong. They also sent me a wrong size t shirt then made me argue over that return. Without doubt the worse ever customer service I have encountered."
"April 16, 2019",1,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! NO ONE TO CONTACT. Do not trust them with your money. If you need a return it will be hell. They sent me the wrong item, which was limited edition, so then out of stock everywhere and I got a completely different item. So, no money back, no item I ordered, and some ugly pair of shoes that weren‚Äôt mine and no one to speak to about it. ORDER ELSE WHERE!"

"April 16, 2019",1,Everything wrong.,One item clearly well worn already. Another was sent in the wrong colour. I won‚Äôt use ASOS again.
"April 16, 2019",1,Customer Service is terrible and will cost you a lot of money.,"I have had many small squabbles with Asos, because there is almost always a little problem with any order. But I looked past it because solving it would not be worth the effort it would take and because ultimately the prices so cheap.However, it has happened REGULARLY that they claim to not have received my returns, so you want to hang on to your receipts for dear life or you lose everything. In total, I have probably lost well over 300  pounds because Asos claimed they didn't get my returns.This time, however, was even worse; I ordered a few items for my upcoming vacation two weeks before my flight. I purposefully checked the tracking info and stayed in 2 days in a row, not leaving my flat, waiting for my parcel. Asos sent me emails 3 times claiming I was not in and they could not deliver the parcel, however, both I and my flatmates were in the house and we KNOW that a delivery truck probably didn't even pull up (we would have heard that).So I contact Customer Service and tell them the issue. By this point, 7 days have passed. They say they cannot redirect the order to be re-sent to me; it's their policy that after 3 ""failed"" delivery attempts, the order goes back to the warehouse and is processed as a return. I make sure to understand this correctly; they said I'd have to reorder all the items I wanted again in a different, separate order because the first parcel was definitely going to be processed as a return and I would receive my money back for that. To make sure, I did tell them I was not going to be in much longer as I was going on holiday and they said they understood and would not send me anything.(A side note here; the customer support person was incredibly rude and passive-aggressive. The lady later was nice, but still unhelpful.)Fast forward to today; 16 days after first placing the order,  it has reappeared and was delivered while I am on holiday. I am not going to be back for a month and when I tell Customer Support about the issue, they say there is nothing they can do and that if I want to return anything after I am back from my holiday, I would maybe get a gift voucher.I am incredibly upset because I did nothing wrong in this situation and Asos does absolutely not care. And they never do, so do yourselves a favour and shop somewhere else - Asos' prices are not worth the headache and in 80% of cases, you'll probably want to return stuff anyway; and that is where the real nightmare starts."

Terrible customer service. And very miss leading"

I needed to contact england by phone after searching the shipping company and then I they asked me to pay double the cost of the parcel itself. ridiculous. you arent supposed to pay if the parcel is less than 75$. and Even if you need to pay then you need to pay when it arrived at your country and not give your credit card to some unknown company that you dont trust. finally I got the parcel after paying and in israel they forced me to pay again!  4X the value in total+parcel value. and this is just for a small parcel.
"April 15, 2019",1,unreliable,ordered on 3.4. was due to arrive 11.4. did not. since 12.4. I'm in an endless conversation with customer service which is a nightmare. no correlation between my questions and their answers. each time someone else writes who has no idea what his colleague wrote in a previous mail. i guess the item never left asos and it was all a hoax because it was a reduced item they never had in real. this was my last purchase attempt at asos.
"April 15, 2019",1,Appalling customer service,"Appalling customer service. They claim free-returns and full refunds but once you try sending back an item, it's mission impossible! It must be very convenient to ask the buyer to request a ""return note"" online (instead of joining it to the delivery sheet like most businesses do!). You can try with dozens of browsers, you can try clearing your cache, you can try entering dozens of addresses (to locate your nearest drop-off point): you ALWAYS end up with an error message which prevents you from registering your return, hence from printing your return label and hence from obtaining a drop-off point. Very CONVENIENT, isn't it? Won't ever purchase from them again..."

I didn‚Äôt have a clue about any of this until I placed three orders recently thinking it would take 2-3 days after payment is processed to deliver as usual. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs been over a month and I still have not received my first order. When I requested a refund for my subscription they said I‚Äôve already been member for a month so I‚Äôm not qualified for a refund. Mind you I‚Äôve been a customer since 2015. It‚Äôs been frustrating for the past 3 days trying to get refunded. One response I received told me that I can get refunded and then when I replied ‚Äòyes‚Äô, another rep says they can‚Äôt refund me. You are basically just chasing your own tail in a circle. These piece of sh*ts all send the same robotic replies and do not offer any kind of resolution.

"April 13, 2019",5,Great service and selection.,"Great app, website and selection of products. Delivery is convenient. Not had the need to return anything but seems straight forward. No issues."
"April 13, 2019",1,They have absolutely shocking‚Ä¶,"They have absolutely shocking aftercare. No ethic, no empathy, no consideration or common sense. Just generic, ‚Äúcomputer says no‚Äù customer service. I‚Äôm a customer services manager for an online retailer and I would be appalled if this was my department."
"April 13, 2019",1,Absolutely shocking,Absolutely shocking. Ordered a dress and then got told (after receiving an email saying it was already on the way) that it was out of stock but I could order another one if I wanted. (This was about half an hour after receiving the refund email btw). Stupidly reordered the dress and they only went and delivered it to the WRONG ADDRESS and now I have no dress and still out of pocket for it. Customer advisors don't seem to care either. DO NOT ORDER FROM ASOS.
"April 13, 2019",1,THIEVES! STEALING!,"Every time I try to use ASOS customer service for an issue, I just receive a scripted reply that does not rectify or answer my question.  Reading other reviews, it is now confirmed that they say the same thing to everyone!!ASOS deactivated my account without articulating what I specifically violated beside ""usual returns activity.""  I've kept a lot of items and spent a lot of money!  I've paid for the Premier Delivery for a few years now and enjoy the flexibility and convince, but now I am penalized for using what I paid for in advance.  ASOS now refuses to return those funds since they terminated a contract!I am able to see that ASOS makes a habit of STEALING our money!!I will file a complaint with my bank and the BBB based on breach of contract without due cause."
"April 12, 2019",2,"Good clothes, crap delivery","Asos clothes themselves are usually good quality.... If and once they arrive. They use Hermes and / or Yodel for their deliveries which is a recipe for disaster. If you have an easy to find and access workplace, send it there and you might be fine. If you send it home and you can't  receive it when it arrives, good luck... I have has experiences with deliveries not arriving at all, arriving in unsafe locations or packages looking damaged. Yodel lets you 'choose' a safe location, but only from a dropdown menu, so it leaves very little room to play with if your safe place doesn't fit 6 or 7 options. It's a shame because the clothes themselves are usually decent and the range is really wide, but the hassle getting it there means it is simply not worth it."
"April 12, 2019",4,I was about to give 5 stars but‚Ä¶,"I was about to give 5 stars but withheld one of the stars.. I will explain.. I only ever purchased two items.. a pair of shoes for my hubby last year and a dress for myself last month.. the shoes arrived swiftly and perfectly and so did my dress.. the dress was beautiful but not nice on me so I returned it on the same day.. the money was back in my account in no time so I was thinking, happy days!! asos are brilliant! Then I received an email.. it was kind of like a warning about returning too many items and basically I felt uncomfortable after reading it.. my initial thoughts were, oh no.. I‚Äôm afraid to buy anything off them again now.. i‚Äôll Feel pressured to keep it and not return it etc.  Just now I have read reviews from others who have had accounts cancelled for doing exactly what I have done.. so while my experience before that email and reading the reviews would have definitely earned them 5 stars without a doubt.. I now feel reluctant to buy from ASOS again.. ü•¥"
"April 12, 2019",1,No help with damaged items,"I ordered a pair of shoes from them for my prom, and they came covered in dirt and scuff marks that would not come off. I contacted them through their website chat option, as I couldn't find a phone number (first red flag). The person on the chat told me that ASOS offers replacements, but not for items that come damaged (???? what else would need replacing?). He told me that I could send them back as a return and repurchase with the refund, but that there would be absolutely NO retribution for the item I paid for that came in unacceptably damaged. I asked if, since replacement was out of the question, I could get a discount on my next order, should I choose to purchase the shoes again, and he told me that I could sign up for their email list to receive monthly promotions. The man was perfectly friendly, but ASOS's customer service policies are unacceptable, especially considering the size and popularity of the company."
"April 12, 2019",1,Refused to cancel my order,My order was due to arrive a few days before I was going to be moving country. The day it was suppose to be delivered the courier tracking update said it was unable to deliver my parcel and to contact the sender as soon as possible. When I contacted asos they said they will rearrange the delivery to be delivered in two weeks. This meant it would be delivered after I moved country. I ask asos to just cancel my order and they said they would not be able to cancel my order as it was against their processes. So now I'm out of pocket and my parcel will be delivered to an address and country I don't live in.
"April 12, 2019",1,Worst Shopping App - Order never arrives,"I usually don‚Äôt review businesses, but after too many bad experiences with ASOS I won‚Äôt hesitate to do so. I‚Äôve placed my order more than 2 months ago, after failing to arrive the first 2 times, one of the items I ordered was already out of stock, that was really unacceptable! After that they sent the order again, and they kept pushing the deadline until it never arrived. The customer service team is just unprofessional and not ready to handle customer requests and issues at all! They keep customers waiting for months until the order never arrives, and they steal the money. Shame"
"April 12, 2019",1,TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,I haven‚Äôt used ASOS for a year and I get an email 2 days ago saying they are going to deactivate my account due to unusual returns activity. They say they‚Äôve made the made this decision based on the fact that I have made a much higher than average number of returns and I won‚Äôt be able to place any further ASOS orders.  This is a joke. Last year I ordered about 4 dresses and I returned them because they were either poor quality or didn‚Äôt fit. I thought the whole idea of internet shopping was to enable customers to order and return if the item wasn‚Äôt suitable. I feel very insulted by this email and there is no way I will ever shop with ASOS again.  With retail in such a poor state as it is you would think they would be doing their very hardest to make their customers very happy.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be long before we see the demise of ASOS and good riddance!
"April 12, 2019",1,Deactivated account over ONE order,"I‚Äôve literally ordered and returned ONE ITEM in the last 1.5 YEARS. I received an email a couple of days ago from ASOS saying that my account has been deactivated because of ‚Äúongoing patterns of returns behavior that is against our policy.‚Äù I was stunned, surprised and completely confused since I‚Äôve only ordered one thing from them recently. I used the chat option and then received an email from ‚ÄòCustomer Care‚Äô saying that they have made the decision due on the fact that I‚Äôve made ‚Äúhigher than average number of returns.‚Äù I emailed them back and asked how can they explain that when I‚Äôve only ordered and returned ONE item in the last year and a half? I received the same automated response back, but they also added ‚ÄúWe will not be providing you with any more details with regards to this as your account has now been deactivated.  We reserve the right to close your account.‚Äù Um. What? I‚Äôve never been so disappointed with a company and their lack of ‚Äòcustomer care‚Äô. How they even came to that decision over ONE order (that was returned sooner than the return date and was never worn with tags still attached) is beyond me. How they can justify THEIR actions I‚Äôll probably never know..."
"April 11, 2019",1,Delivery is worse than abysmal,Delivery is worse than abysmal. Ordered 5 weeks ago standard shipping that was supposed to arrive within three weeks. They told me to wait another three....In the mean time I ordered from another retailer and selected ground shipping and the order arrived in two days. Canada post site says that even cross country standard is about 4 days. So basically ASOS shipped the order late or haven‚Äôt shipped yet. And forget trying to get help. They won‚Äôt help. Don‚Äôt order from them they are a scam.
"April 11, 2019",5,AMAZING!,Asos is amazing!!!! Next day delivery always comes on time. Very easy to return items hassle free with collect + and Royal mail
"April 11, 2019",1,I did an order one week ago,"I did an order one week ago. When I booked the dressess on the screen was written that I should receive the dressess 4 days after on the 10 April. Now are 2 days that I'm chatting with the assistance because they dont have a Call center and she told me that probably I could receive my dressess on the 19 April because of a mistake due with their partners. Then, she stopped the conversation telling me to contact the delivery company even if it should be their duty not mine, because I paid for a service and I paid as well to receive the dressess within a specific date. Now my order is ""still on the way"", but I did this order because of an event. I dont know if I will be able to use that dressess for the occasion even if I paid for that. No words"
"April 11, 2019",5,Extraordinary clothes and shoes,"I ve just received my first order on ASOS and I am trully amased by the quality of the fabrics and the modern cuts!Plus,the package arrived 5 days earlier than predicted!The sizes are true and every product looks exactly as in the pictures on their site.I cant wait to put my next order on Asos.com.I am in the range of Tall clothing.I highly recommend ASOS!Dont hesitate to order you too!"
"April 11, 2019",1,I'd give a 0 rating if I could,"I'd give a 0 rating if I could. I had a terrible experience and customer service was completely unable to offer solutions or rectify the problem. 2 Day shipping was actually 11 days, which is totally unacceptable. I had multiple events the items were ordered for and they didn't arrive until two days after said events. I had to scramble to find replacements. Customer Service could have offered to reissues and overnight the order when I contacted them the day after predicted arrival had past, but didn't bother. They just said we have to wait until the package arrives. Never again will I order from this company."
"April 11, 2019",5,Amazing service super quick delivery,"Just wanted to write a review of how brilliant the service was from ASOS as everyone is quick to always write negative reviews! I purchased a tracksuit in the sale and unfortunately it was too big for me, I sent it back using free return Royal Mail tracked and got my email and refund in 2 days (super speedy thank you) I went to order the next size down and this was out of stock so a friend recommended looking on the Spanish/french/German sites as sometimes they are still in stock! I did this ordered yesterday late morning and it arrived in the UK at 13.00pm what amazing service and super quick delivery! Next working day delivery and package was shipped with DHL from Germany! Thank you Asos item fits perfect and the ¬£5 delivery was totally worth it! Keep up the amazing service üòÅ"
"April 11, 2019",1,I would give 0 stars if possible,"I would give 0 stars if possible, purely for the poor customer service. No matter what their mistake is, they cannot rectify it satisfactorily and this seems to go against the purpose of online shopping. Constant disappointment when dealing with them. Shameful."
"April 11, 2019",1,Terrible!,"I used to LOVE Asos! They were my go to! Now their customer service is absolutely pitiful. They do not cover customs charges for certain items anymore, and they don't offer the free 2 day shipping for $19 a year. Last time I needed help, their online chat people had no interest in helping and kept ending the chat. They also deactivated my husbands account because he had ""unusual returns."" He hadn't even ordered from them in a year! And when he did, he only returned a couple things UNWORN WITH THE TAGS ATTACHED because they did not fit! When he emailed to ask about it, they again had no interest in looking into it further and re-activating his account. YOUR LOSS ASOS- YOU JUST LOST 2 MORE CUSTOMERS AND PROBABLY WON'T BE IN BUSINESS MUCH LONGER BECAUSE OF YOUR TERRIBLE WAY OF DOING IT!"
"April 11, 2019",1,I placed an order number 397844277 with‚Ä¶,"I placed an order number 397844277 with ¬£196 which was eligible for your discount ¬£30Then, I requested an exchange (sizing down) for the hoddie. They say they offer exchange. Now, for some reason, the hoddie (price tagged ¬£65) was refunded as ¬£35 which does not make any sense for two reasons.First, I requested an exchange and not a refund, the item is still available online and did not run out of the stock at any moment when I was contacting your customer care.Secondly, even if I requested a refund, I should be eligible for ¬£20 off ¬£125, which mean I would be refunded ¬£55 and not ¬£35.Bottom line, ASOS owes me either ¬£20 or a size small of that hoddie and I want the hoddie.Also, for some reason, your customer care are trying to outsmart me and issue me a 2-day ¬£30 discount code that only applicable on purchase of ¬£175!!! This is ridiculous, it is not a big company manner, but a street dealers!!They are not replying my messages or e-mails. Now, I regret not checking their review rating, I can relate why now!!"
"April 11, 2019",1,Account has been deactivated for number‚Ä¶,Account has been deactivated for number of returns! Since when do online companies discriminate for this...i understand if people are purchasing items wearing them then returning then but to deactivate someones account because they return goods is ridiculous! What business are they running...wont be surprised if they go bust with that attitide especiallly when they are penalising people for returns made BEFORE they changed their policy on returns. I actually like the variety they offer and liked the fact it was easy to return unwanted and unsuitable items but hey ho guess someone else will benefit now.
"April 11, 2019",5,ASOS is a life saver for me..,ASOS is a life saver for me... people talking about having accounts deactivated I don‚Äôt understand their frustrations as if they send all their orders back is fairly obvious they are not too keen on the brand and brands they stock. I buy from them all the time and send back stuff as required and have never had any issues...
"April 11, 2019",1,Would give 0 stars if I could,I have ordered and returned no more than 3 items (the quality of these items was horrendous and the sizing was off) and my account has been deactivated as a result due to ''unusual returns activity''. Their customer care have been extremely rude throughout and have refused to provide more details as to why my account has been deactivated ''because this account has now been deactivated'' (would love to understand the logic behind that). ASOS do offer free shipping and returns but you will be penalised if you return anything. This is an online retailer and as such people will intrinsically return items because they might look and fit different to pictures on the website - this returns policy is designed to coerce customers into keeping items they do not want to keep.
"April 11, 2019",1,Terrible customer ‚Äúservice‚Äù,"I have shopped with ASOS for years, primarily attracted by their free returns policy which is crucial for online retailers. Today my account was suspended because my returns rate was ‚Äúabove average‚Äù. When I contacted customer services for further information they stated my account was suspended for ‚Äúsuspicious activity‚Äù. I very much resent the implication. I have always returned items within the time limits specified, not worn, with labels and in the original condition. Emailed ASOS to query this further. Their response: ‚Äúwe‚Äôll not be providing further information about your account closer and premier delivery as our decision is final‚Äù. Meaning they have refused to refund me the ¬£9.95 I paid for the premium delivery service I can no longer use.  Terrible service."
"April 11, 2019",1,Disgusting Customer Service,"I made an order online with with 8 items, I received a tiny package with 2 items and they basically blame me for undelivered goods from their side. They basically steal money and say it very rare for something like this to happen. Very sad to say that Asos is a SCAM"
"April 11, 2019",5,Never had a problem!,"I love ASOS. My favourite company to shop from, with good prices and a diverse range of clothing. Their customer service is super speedy especially via Twitter and have never let me down.However! I have not used their services since they‚Äôve put in place their new returns policy (which is to prevent people wearing clothes and then returning them) so I‚Äôm not too sure but I have faith in their customer service that they would fix it if there was ever a problem."
"April 11, 2019",1,TERRIBLE COMPANY,ITEMS ARE POORLY MADE AND CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIBLE.I orginally had high hopes for this company and would give it negative or zero stars if that was an option.  ***You will be penalized if you return items.  They will not refund according to policy and they will just deactivate your account altogether.  I have also reported them to the better business bureau.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS AWFUL SITE. THEY DO NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS AND WILL SCAM YOU.
"April 10, 2019",1,Poor service,Ordered some item for next day delivery got them 3 days later. They items are not packed properly some of they stuff is really poor quality rather shop at primark then ASOS again. ASOS own brand product are of low quality.
"April 10, 2019",1,Today I have received an email telling‚Ä¶,"Today I have received an email telling me that ASOS no longer want my business and have suspended my account.  Charming.  According to the news I am the demographic they have failed to reach in sufficient numbers.  I am also the demographic that is likely to try items on and to return them if they are unflattering.  I do not subscribe to the wear once and discard principle so I do not buy continuously but when I do buy I am not looking for cheap clothing and I am prepared to pay more.  ASOS positively encourage you to make use of their returns service - it is plastered all over their website - and yet this is the reason I am given for them having suspended my account.   A little warning might have been polite!   I will continue to buy from Zara, H & M etc and will not give ASOS a second thought."
"April 10, 2019",1,Laughable service and processes,"If I could put 0 I would... so just to sum this up, my account has been permanently deleted due to an unusual amount of returns (4 this year)!!!1st order I returned as the 2 pairs of jeans were not true to size. 2nd order I returned as the trousers were thin and horrible material and the bikini top was nothing like the picture3rd order I returned as it was a shirt for my boyfriends birthday (completely unopened) and he didn‚Äôt like it4th order I returned as it was a wrap dress that didn‚Äôt show how low it was in the picture and I would have had to pin it if I wore it.Asos have confirmed all items were returned in original state but apparently I have returned over an ‚Äòaverage‚Äô amount of returns. For someone who has ALWAYS ordered and kept items but not liked the last few orders I have now been permanently deactivated. No explanation just an email with my account deleted... nice one ASOS! Good luck keeping customers with these ridiculous policies!!"
"April 10, 2019",1,Awful customer service,Awful customer service. Difficult to get in touch with to get a solution.
"April 10, 2019",1,Avoid - Avoid - Avoid ASOS,"Avoid them if you can, merchandise cheap and customer service tough to connect with and get a resolution - frustrating (though not rude)."
"April 10, 2019",2,Misleading new policy on returns/extension of return period,"Your old return policy was bad enough (ie short) and now the new one claims an extension to 45 days.. but during the extension period, you only get a 'gift card' for your returns. People are trying to buy clothing, not gift cards, and this is way too short a period to be not offering a full refund to your customers. There are plenty of places online to shop, so I'm surprised at your lack of generosity."
"April 10, 2019",1,1 star is to generous,"1 star is to generous, absolute symbolic company. Their warehouse staff are messing about with all the products and then advising customers will be up to 17 working days to get a refund or replacement. Won't be using again. (Isn't the first time ) will be the last."
"April 10, 2019",4,Responsive and resolved my issue.,"Responsive and resolved my issue.Although Yodel lost my package or left it somewhere for someone to claim for themselves (I was never told what the outcome of ASOS' investigation with Yodel was), ASOS re-sent my order. Although some of the products were no longer available I still think ASOS were good at providing the customer with the best possible outcome. The instant chat function on their website is really good. They should stick to their previous delivery company, and stop paying Yodel immediately. I've only heard bad things about Yodel."
"April 10, 2019",1,Package Lost no one helps,"I have had the worst service possible with this company. I placed an order March 19th, standard deliver, so I expected it to be at least 10 days.  We are now on day 20 and I still do not have any answer as to where my order is. I have been told to wait another 3 weeks and maybe it will show up because it was lost. I have asked for a refund which has been denied, the customer service teams just copy and paste the same answer over and over. I‚Äôm at a lost and not sure what to do now, I have contacted my credit card company to start a claim and that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at now. The worst company to deal with in 2019!"
"April 10, 2019",4,Overall Okay,I don't understand why they have so many bad reviews here . They got my order right but they are a bit slow with shipping and some of their items run big so check before hand.
"April 09, 2019",1,Three out of Three Orders Wrong,"I've ordered from this website twice. The first time I received the wrong size. I wrote to Asos and they said they would send me the right size, but my replacement item was also the wrong size. The second time I ordered, I received the wrong color. I talked to someone at Asos and they said they would not look into the issue since their warehouse is too big to investigate. I didn't bother to order a replacement. Three out of three orders wrong is enough for me. Will never order from Asos again."
"April 09, 2019",5,AMAZING!,I have shopped with asos every month for over 10 years. I have only had very few issues with faulty or wrong intems and in those casses the customer service have been very helpfull. Asos have some great clothes and a wide selection. I give asos my deepest recommemdation to everyone!
"April 09, 2019",5,Happy regular customer,"I‚Äôve used ASOS regularly for a few years now. I pay ¬£9.95 per year for as many next day deliveries as I like, well worth the money. Have returned items with no difficulty. Using Klarna is handy as you can order different clothes sizes & return what you don‚Äôt want before you pay (30 days after placing order). I‚Äôm liking the variety of brands on offer in their beauty section too."
"April 09, 2019",1,Poor customer service,Poor customer service!!!I used chat to talk to an customer service advisor and it was like WE DONT CARE. Will think twice about future purchases
"April 09, 2019",1,Here's the problem,Here's the problem. For every good experience (which I assume is because they've never had to return) there are a thousand more bad. And I've tried to give this place so many chances but they fail at every turn with their customer service. Here's what I have had to do in order to get my money back for returns that are usually due to their mistake. 1. Contact my bank to file fraud charges. I do this first because I already know I'm going to get a headache and no help. 2. I email customer service - and cc their CEO - Nick Beighton - his email is his first name. last initial at asos in case you need to email him.3.  I complain once a day until the either refund me promptly or my bank steps in to rectify the matter themselves. Customers should not have to chase down their refunds due to Asos mistake. Their customer service is abhorrent and needs a complete overall. Hell maybe their CEO should go as well because they obviously could care squat about their customers. Over it. I wanted to continue shopping here but the customer service alone has lost me. Good luck!
"April 09, 2019",1,I'll just leave this here:,"I'll just leave this here:Here is your ASOS chat transcript:ASOS[15:58:27] You're now chatting to AlfieDuncan Hewitt[15:58:29] The Lindbergh relaxed fit trousers have come with a white strip down the side rather than a turquoise. Why is this and can you switch them over please?ASOS[15:58:30] Hi, you're through to ASOS - thanks for letting me know your details. I'm just going to check this info for you.   Your chat reference is 18880266.[15:59:16] Hi Duncan, Thanks for getting in touch. I'm sorry to hear your item is wrong. Please bear with me for a few minutes whilst I have a look into this for you.Duncan Hewitt[15:59:55] it's odd because on the label and packaging it all matches up but the strip is the wrong colourASOS[16:01:52] So we can get this sorted for you, please return your item back to us within 28 days for free for a full refund or a replacement. If you want a replacement of the item, indicate this on the returns note and if the item is still in stock we‚Äôll ship a replacement to you. If you want a refund or your item is out of stock,  we‚Äôll refund you for the item and drop you an email to confirm. To find out more about how to return, and select your country from the 'return from' list. Please fill in the section on the back of your delivery note to say the item is incorrect and put the note in your parcel when you send it back. Do ask for proof of postage and ensure you keep it safe in case we need to look at it later on. Duncan Hewitt[16:02:36] Can you check if the correct item in stock? I don't want to send them back and then am told the item I'm after is out of stockASOS[16:02:51] I can, bear with me[16:03:48] I can see they are in stock but they are low, so I would recommend re ordering them and sending the wrong ones back to us for a refund.Duncan Hewitt[16:05:21] That is a lot of hassle. Can't you order the correct ones, get them sent out to me whilst in the meantime I return the trousers to you. It is your error after allASOS[16:05:35] We're not able to do this for you DuncanDuncan Hewitt[16:06:09] So, I have to spend more money to correct an error your team has made? Then wait for x amount of days for you to refund me for your mistake?ASOS[16:07:02] I'm sorry about this, you don't have to place the new order. You can wait for an exchangeDuncan Hewitt[16:08:49] Yes, but that is a risk. This is nowhere near good enough. Clearly it is not personally your fault but I expect to be treated better than this. Happy to talk to somebody more senior if so. I'm a loyal and regular customer. I've just spent ¬£130 on clothes with you. An item is wrong so you guys need to sort this, not meASOS[16:09:16] We are all empowered to give the same level of customer service so a supervisor or a manager will not be advising you any different, They also do not work on live chats. We have processes in place and have to advise according to them.Duncan Hewitt[16:10:13] Absolutely. But when a process is not adequately working for a customer then they must be allowed to go beyond them. It doesn't have to be on live chat. You can get them to call me or I can call them.ASOS[16:10:45] I understand but we will not be able to do anything else for you. This will need to be returned and refunded or exchnaged[16:10:54] *ExchangedDuncan Hewitt[16:12:00] Yes, so send me the correct item immediately and I will begin the returns process from this end. The price is the same, the code is the same so I do not understand why I need to create a whole new order. This order will also charge me for delivery.ASOS[16:12:32] I'm unable to send you a new item Duncan, If you get back in contact after you place the new order we can get this refunded for youDuncan Hewitt[16:13:44] Ok Alfie you are now bordering on being unhelpful. You have a very simple choice as a business. You either work with me and compensate me for this error, either financially or through customer service or I can just return the whole order and not use your service again. It's a very simple choice you have your endASOS[16:14:31] I understand, i'm sorry about this but we aren't able to send out a replacement for this.Duncan Hewitt[16:14:46] It isn't a 'new' item - it is the item I ordered which you messed up[16:14:56] Ok, please give me a number to call for somebody to talk toASOS[16:15:15] We don't have a direct line so we're not set up to receive phone calls and are an online company so we deal with all complaints and queries via Live Chat, Email, Twitter and Facebook.Duncan Hewitt[16:16:01] Ok, then deal I would now like to make a complaint[16:16:15] What is the correct process to go through to make a complaint?ASOS[16:16:23] No problem, you can send this over to me on the live chat and I will get it sent over to the relevant team.Duncan Hewitt[16:16:42] And how will they contact me?ASOS[16:17:04] They won't be back in contact, we will use this internally to improve our servicesDuncan Hewitt[16:17:57] Sorry, what? No, no, no. Please give me a way to contact a more senior member of staff? A decision maker. Otherwise, what is the point in having management?ASOS[16:18:26] As previously advised a manager won't be able to advise you differently, and they also don't work live chatsDuncan Hewitt[16:19:33] Read very carefully what I am saying, Alfie. It doesn't have to be on live chat. Give me a way to contact a member of management. I'm not going to be put off by you saying a manger won't be able to help me any differently. I still request to speak to one so please advise on how to do thisASOS[16:21:57] Our managers do not get back in contact with customers via email, Duncan. I'm sorry about this.

"April 09, 2019",1,Incompetent courier service,I couldn't get my order due to their incompetent courier service! I would have picked it up myself but was told this wasn't an available option either! I wouldn't bother with ASOS and shop somewhere which is guaranteed to deliver what you pay for.
"April 09, 2019",4,Love Asos!,"Always order from here, never had any issues! Just got a lot of things for my Europe trip at great prices, sizing was also pretty accurate."
"April 09, 2019",1,HORRIBLE RETURN EXPERIENCE,"TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE customer service.I've ordered some things from Asos in the past, and they've always taken WEEKS to arrive without any confirmation numbers or tracking numbers.In my most recent order, I had purchased 3 items. One of the items was COMPLETELY incorrect. I had bough a medium size floral body suit... and the item that came was tiny tank top body suit (definitely a fraction of the price I paid for the floral body suit).I promptly returned the incorrect item with the return slip that came with the order. And have not heard back in 3 weeks...I chatted with a customer service rep, and she was completely useless. She wanted me to provide proof of postage and the item # of the incorrect item. How the f*** am I supposed to provide the item # of the incorrect item, when the item was INCORRECT?!?! The receipt had the CORRECT item listed... and I got some random piece of s*** in the mail...I asked the customer service rep, ""is there ANYTHING you can do for me in this situation? You guys sent me an incorrect item. And I followed all the return policies and procedures."" She straight up told me ""No. You are responsible for the item up until it's in our posession.""Truly awful experience, will never order from them again.DO NOT BUY FROM ASOS, the prices are not that great, and the quality is trash. Not worth it all for the disgusting customer service that comes with it."
"April 08, 2019",1,I never had such a bad experience like‚Ä¶,"I never had such a bad experience like with ASOS. My story: as I lived in Budapest I ordered shoes to Hungary. I never got them. Then I wrote to the customer support and they didn¬¥t answer at all. Later I wrote again and I got just a pre-built mail that the tracking says I got them and they can not help me. After I complained they BLOCKED and BANNED me in a really rude way. Never got such an impolite mail and it seemed more somebody with a really low level wrote it. I had to accept that my shoes were lost and ASOS didn¬¥t want to help me at all. I accepted it, but in their opinion I was a liar. Two months later I found a refund on my credit card account - for the shoes. So it seems the shoes were somewhere at a post office in Budapest and as nobody picked them up they sent them back. It was clear visible that ASOS made this impolite and rude mistake with blocking and banning me - but still I got just a rude answer as I wrote them the story. When I try to order now again they cancel my order a few hours later. It seems they don¬¥t need customers and with such a service such a shop should really fail..."
"April 08, 2019",1,ASOS; a pack of losers,"There is a reason this company has so few stars; it actually, truly and really sucks! I made a 400 euro order of 13 items and had it shipped for next day delivery. I had a job interview and was counting on some of the items fitting so that I could have something good to wear. I haven't been shopping lately, and I never bought from ASOS before, so I don't know how big or small their stuff runs. So I entered some data about my height, weight and body type into their (useless) AI and used their fit assistant to tell me what size to buy for my purchases. I was a trusting fool, let me tell you. I feel so stupid now. Everything I received was WAY to big. EVERYTHING (not to mention super crap-a-licious quality). I had to return ALL of the items (this costs 10 bucks) and I asked them to refund the 20 bucks I spent on the next day shipping. Reason being that I had trusted them that their fit assistant recommendations were of SOME use, but I ended up having to send back the ENTIRE 13 item order when not one item fit! I can understand that some things probably will not fit...but everything??? You can bet your bottom dollar that they didn't give a flying **, and just said that it is the customer's responsibility to order the right size and that they take no responsibility for their fit assistant. If you are a first time customer and you can't try on the darn clothes, how are you supposed to know how they fit?! You might foolishly trust their silly and deceitful AI! Why do they have that thing if it doesn't work AT ALL? This is a great way to lose a first time customer who was willing to dole out 400 bucks. I guess they have no interest in retaining customers. You would think that you can put some amount of faith in a large retailer like this. You can't. I wish that I had read reviews on Trustpilot first, I never should have ordered with them in the first place. Now I am just afraid that I won't get my refund. I ended up spending 30 euros to have nothing in the end. These guys are a pack of losers. Yeah, and I seriously had to improvise on that job interview outfit, things got a bit odd. A domino effect of frustration and travesty has occurred! ASOS, YOU SUCK! Feels good to write that..."
"April 08, 2019",2,Gone downhill,"Won't be using ASOS in future since they've announced customers who return stuff are basically going to be banned and not refunded. Range began increasingly poor in terms of quality and fit, I would recommend taking pictures of a variety of body sizes to avoid returns and sort out the sizes. It's not the customer's fault. Completely disgusted at their returns policy and will be buying elsewhere from now on."
"April 08, 2019",1,Delayed next day delivery service and no refund,"I placed an order for DPD next day delivery, then received the email from DPD that it would be due the day after. Sure, I'm fine to wait for one more day though it's a next day service. Then when the day came, got no updates from DPD which shows that they haven't received the parcel from ASOS yet. Contacted the ASOS customer services who could do nothing but asked me to wait 48 hours for a reply. 48 hours passed, I contacted again and was asked to wait for another 24 hours. Finally received the reply saying that there was a problem with my order leaving the warehouse and they could not be able to locate it. They would send a replacement order which is expected to arrive tomorrow, but haven't received any updates from DPD yet. When I asked for any compensation for the Premier Delivery service that I paid for, the reply was really unsatisfactory and made me write this review. They write: ""As we've now sorted this for you, we're not able to offer any compensation - this is not something that we provided here at ASOS"".I want to say, this is not something you provide, this is something I paid and should be eligible for a refund. I was shocked by the irresponsible customer services who are unconscious of consumer rights."
"April 08, 2019",1,Shocking customer service and delivery service!!!,"Absolutely terrible customer service! My delivery didn‚Äôt turn up next day as paid and requested for! I contacted them and was told that a calling card was left and they were unable to deliver as I wasn‚Äôt in. I can confirm I was in all day and I even left a safe place for them to leave the parcel if I wasn‚Äôt there! They clearly didn‚Äôt use that safe place (meaning they didn‚Äôt even bother to try and deliver). I then went onto their live chat which was absolutely appalling! One of them said to me ‚ÄòI‚Äôve said all I can say so I‚Äôm closing the chat now, have a nice day‚Äô I then tried a different way of contacting and making a complaint via Facebook and had a terrible experience there too! She constantly just kept using pre worded templates and said feedback will be passed on when I kept clearly stating I wanted to make an official complaint. I am not ordering with them ever again! Horrific!!"
"April 07, 2019",1,Terrible delivery service and customer‚Ä¶,"Terrible delivery service and customer service. The delivery companies did not deliver, despite us being at home. This happened consistently. Complained to customer service - they were indifferent and did not take any steps to tackle the problem. Writing this review on behalf of my girlfriend, after seeing her struggle with recent deliveries. In contrast, my Amazon deliveries always arrive, and Amazon's customer support genuinely helps."
"April 07, 2019",3,ASOS delivery,"ASOS delivery, returns and pricing are great. The reason I've knocked it down to three stars is because if you do have a problem and you need to get hold of them there is no phone line. Relying on social media contact methods is infuriating. I had some issues in the past with delivery charges and it took a long time to get sorted out and I dreaded getting in touch with them because I just wanted to speak to someone."

"April 07, 2019",1,Frankly ASOS service has gone downhill,"Frankly ASOS service has gone downhill. Reading other reviews also suggests I'm not the only one who thinks so. Unfortunately, they decide to use a delivery company (Gnewt) within London that never delivers when they're supposed to. NEXT DAY delivery is non-existent and when contacting ASOS their response is that they need to wait 1 working day for Gnewt to get back to them. Surely they should be able to contact Gnewt straight away and get a response same day? If I've ordered an item on Fri for next day delivery on Sat and need to wait until the end of the day on Mon for an update on my delivery, how is that NEXT DAY service? ASOS advise that its beyond their control. It's not beyond their control! They can award the London delivery contract to another company who can actually fulfil the contract! What fantastic service ASOS..not! I applaud you on losing another customer!"
"April 07, 2019",1,Rude CS agents and no VAT deduction!,"This company doesn't deduct VAT as they should shipping out of UK to other countries overseas. I was chatting with an agent named Tori, super rude and just cut off the chat on purpose without even getting a response from me first. I have chat a number of times with the agents there, all of them are rude, not helpful, lazy to help the customers with enquiries etc. Shop at other companies that do the right thing!"

"April 07, 2019",1,Awful customer service,"Awful customer service - ordered two dresses which didn't arrive, despite the delivery person forging my signature to say that they had. DHL accepted liability as they couldnt say whether the dresses had or hadn't been delivered, ASOS said they would send a replacement. Fine. Two days later they get in touch to say sorry, dresses out of stock so have a refund (no mention of refunded delivery fee) even though one of the dresses is still available to buy online! Ridiculous doesn't cover it. Cheap clothing with super basic customer service."
"April 07, 2019",1,Never using them again,"The item didn't arrive in the stated time. When I reported it, they asked me to wait another 10 day. I did, and they just asked me to wait some more. Finally when they actually decided to check, they tried to reship the item but it was out of stock. By that time I didn't want the item anyway. Eventually they decided to do a refund but they refunded me the wrong amount. I had to write in yet again to get the full amount. Dealing with them was a nightmare. I won't ever use asos again."
"April 07, 2019",1,WASTE OF TIME,"So I knew ASOS had awful reviews before making an order, but I wanted to give them a chance anyway because I really liked the look of their clothes: I spent hours looking through the website and picking out clothes I wanted to get - and checked out with afterpay (which was also a struggle - you could only use afterpay on the app, and the app would not log me in, so it took me a few days to be able to login). Once I had my order, three days later I got an email saying that my order had been dispatched. I was so excited! Two days  after that I checked my emails again to see that they had cancelled my order and 'refunded' my afterpay - with no reason or explanation as to why. I honestly just let it go after reading the reviews of their customer service - could not be bothered to argue about it."
"April 06, 2019",1,Bad Quality,I bought a pair of their ASOS DESIGN Jakie lace up espadrille trainers and it ripped the moment I put them on. I was hoping to wear them on vacation next week but now it won‚Äôt be possible. Waiting on their customer service which seems like an eternity

"April 06, 2019",1,I'd give no stars if I could...,"Had the same exact experience as Emma Martyn below. Placed an order, was told it was shipped & the estimated arrival date, but received zero tracking information. When it was past the estimated date & I still hadn't heard any updates, I contacted customer care, who told me tracking numbers would be provided & I should expect to receive my order the following week. No tracking number was ever updated on the site (they didn't even update the arrival date on there).*That* estimated arrival date was 3 days ago, I reached out to customer care again today and was told that it was being sent back to the warehouse due to not being picked up from the access point. Which, again, I received no notification nor tracking detail to inform me that it had even arrived there. And instead of just sending me the items that I paid for and still want (including a pair of shoes that are no longer even on the website), I'm expected to get a refund by MAY (aka 2 months after initially purchasing) and should apparently try to buy the items again then. I think the most maddening point of this whole experience is how ASOS and its customer care team refuse to acknowledge any responsibility or take accountability despite the fact that I'm clearly not the only person this has happened to. Definitely won't be buying from them again, which is sad because other than this I've had little to no problems with them. As someone who's worked in retail I typically hate complaining online/publicly/at all, but man, this truly sucked."
"April 06, 2019",1,Last week I ordered clothes for a‚Ä¶,"Last week I ordered clothes for a holiday in a weeks time - effectively leaving 2 weeks for delivery. I was meant to receive my order on Wednesday. Followed up today (a Saturday) to see where it was, only to find out it has been returned to the depot due to attempted delivery attempts. There was no card or phone call made to notify me of attempted delivery and I received two other deliveries this week with no issues. When I contacted their customer service I was told I could not  have my parcel returned to me and would be given credit on the gift card I used to purchase the clothes. This would be put on my account by the day before I go on holiday, therefore rendering this useless to me. I have asked for a refund on the gift card which again was refused. Not sure what the point of having an online business is if you are unable to receive the goods you order in a timely manner. I‚Äôm stuck with a ¬£50 credit to be spent on goods I may or may not receive. Won‚Äôt be shopping with ASOS again."

WOW. my jaw dropped. i ordered some stuff few weeks back and after 2 days they posted that its been sent. there was no tracking number but i just shrugged it off trying to wait for the delivery date they posted on their app before i contact them. so when i did and after ""joshua"" here got mad at me for contacting them, they placed a new order for me as if im stupid. i hope i receive this order and never again will i order from this scam site."

Then on the day the dress was supposed to come, I get my FIRST update from ASOS saying it won't be shipped until the next day and will take up to 2 weeks to arrive. ARE YOU JOKING?I ended up having to buy a second dress to wear to the event. I thought I would keep the ASOS dress because I still liked it, but when it arrived, IT HAD A HUGE HOLE IN IT. In order to get my refund, I had to drive it to a UPS store to ship it back to them.Waste of time. Terrible customer service. Avoid at all costs."

Customer Service is absolutely disgustingI am almost ¬£200 out of pocket because my parcel was supposedly delivered to a neighbour but they are adamant it wasn't. All ASOS did was a big fat nothing and basically laughed in my face. The Customer Service team is awful....maybe they are high...maybe they are vindictive because they have nothing better to do....maybe they are trained that way. Whatever it is, they are incompetent and treating customers disgustingly with no empathy, understanding or care. ASOS partnering with DPD is also tragic as it sounds like they are in cahoots and stealing peoples packages. This is not the first case i've heard of this across London, and it seems to be specifically in the LGBT community. Never again will I contribute to this organisation"

"April 05, 2019",1,The worst customer service I have ever encountered.,"I can see why Asos have a 1 star rating, their customer service is an absolute joke. If your order is picked correctly with no damage then its fine however you come across a small problem like I did then you are given lies and misleading advice.I was incorrectly refunded when I requested an exchange for a damaged item however they removed the ¬£10 code I used which expected me to spend ¬£80 and refunded me ¬£3. I got in contact and expected to have been provided a new code to reorder the incorrect refund so this could be rectified. How wrong was i.It seems Asos create their own rules or their advisor's are just dumb. They gave me a new code of ¬£10 but slapped on a ¬£80 minimum spend on an item which which was refunded is ¬£13. Got back in contact with them on Twitter and was given another ¬£5 code which again is useless as this doesn't even cover the cost of the item I wanted and leaves me having to fork out for their error.After trying to explain this to them I seem to be getting thick advisor's who spin around the same template saying ""oh, stock levels must have been low"" NO THE ITEM WAS, AND STILL IS IN STOCK!"". I can see why they don't liaise over the phone, just imagine having to speak to people with this kind of idiocy over the phone. They would get eaten alive. I had one chat advisor saying she cannot assist me further and even gave me the ""your chat will be ended if you don't respond in 5 minutes"" because she was too stupid to resolve my simple query.Save yourself the hassle and don't order from Asos, I know I won't be anymore."

Each time I talk to customer service chat they say ""somoene already responded to this query"" well no... because no one has got back to meNow today I tried for 2 hours, five convos later because people just kept closing the convo or because after 5 minutes of not talking or responding it automatically closes (litte hint here, every few minutes just keep messaging so they cant cancel the call)Still here, trying to get my money back.... should have stuck wth my gut.Update: just recieved below response!!!I‚Äôve had a look at your account and can confirm that your account will remain closed.This account has been deleted and any future orders placed or accounts opened will be cancelled and closed.

"April 02, 2019",1,There is no customer service.,"There is no customer service.I tracked my delivery online until I was the next delivery, stood by the doorbell, and then the screen refreshed and just said that the driver couldn‚Äôt access my property. Contacted ASOS via chat and explained. The robotic Daniel said that nobody had been home to sign (despite me having already explained the situation). Clearly untrue. I was literally stood by the doorbell waiting because I was the next delivery on the online tracker. I asked Daniel to speak with the delivery company to find out why they said nobody home (maybe they have the wrong address?) - he refused. I asked Daniel to escalate to a manager or to their complaints team (maybe they have the authority to speak to the delivery company?) - he refused. Daniel told me that there is nobody else in the whole of ASOS that anything can EVER be escalated to or passed on to. Apparently nobody can ever speak to the delivery company to find out what‚Äôs happening either. Then when I repeated that it was false that nobody was home and asked again to escalate, Daniel changed the story from ‚Äònobody there to sign for it‚Äô to ‚Äòwell, there might be lots of reasons why the driver couldn‚Äôt deliver‚Äô. I‚Äôm not sure what these reasons are, as the street is easy to access, with street parking, and the doorbell is right on the front and definitely working. But presumably, it might be a good idea to ask the driver before he or she attempts redelivery another day?So, absolutely useless, they couldn‚Äôt care less and they will not do anything to actually investigate beyond reading whatever the computer screen says. I‚Äôve spent a lot with ASOS, but every time something goes wrong it‚Äôs a mess to speak with them. I think it‚Äôs time to kick my ASOS habit."
"April 02, 2019",5,Great company,"Great company, quick with refunds, easy return and refund process. Quality products."
"April 02, 2019",1,I would give 0 stars if I could,"I would give 0 stars if I could. I immediately contacted ASOS with a shipping error and was provided no guidance with how to resolve my issue. There is no reason I cannot cancel or alter my order within one hour of placing it. I have had this issue with lots of other major retailers who have been more than accommodating. Now, I have no way to retrieve my items and the customer service team has ultimately said you‚Äôre SOL. Never shopping here again."
"April 01, 2019",3,Serious sizing issues,"I ordered tops which are perfect but the Jean's I ordered were tiny, I'm a size 12, and they wouldn't go past my knees! And love the picture so ordered 2 sizes bigger (16). What I got which did actually close, looked nothing like the picture. I'm 5'3"" and supposedly cropped Jean's were down past my ankles. Ridiculous sizing. Not sure if I will order again to be honest. Still waiting for the refund for the size 6, I mean 12 pair too!"
"April 01, 2019",1,Attempted delivery - NOT!,"I paid for next day delivery to a click and collect shop. A very busy BP station in the centre of a town. The delivery company said they attempted delivery, but nobody was it. That's an absolute lie. I used click and collect, and a busy BP station, so that very thing wouldn't happen. They now won't refund my next day delivery because they said they had attempted the delivery. ABSOLUTE LIARS."
"April 01, 2019",1,Absolutely horrendous customer service,Absolutely horrendous customer service. I placed an order 03/26/2019 and paid for expedited shipping which was quoted for delivery on 03/28/2019. My bank account was charged on 03/27/2019. The package arrived on 04/01/2019 but the UPS delivery man would not release the package because it was shipped COD. I have already paid and the event I order the product for has already passed. Asos took no responsibility for communicating customs charges if incurred will be COD because they have statement about this on there help page. Why would I be on the help page when placing a simple order. If this is going to be their practice then it should be communicated during the check out process. In addition they are unwilling to compensate me for the  delayed delivery and embarrassment of having zero cash on me when the delivery arrived. So now I either wait up to 10 days for a refund or pay double the cost of my order product in customs fees.
"April 01, 2019",5,"Go-To website, never a bad experience.","ASOS is definitely my go-to website when shopping clothes, I do know my way around online shopping, and how to tell good quality from bad quality clothes, but ASOS have never failed me in the quality of their clothes, nevertheless. So, great quality clothes for good and fair prices.When I've had to return my clothes, it's also been very easy, it's just printing out a label, and filling out a form, nothing too tricky, plus it's free, like the shipping, with a 30-day return policy. And you get your money back within 2 weeks, when they've gotten back your clothes, and confirmed that it's in good shape. Keep in mind though, that this is in Denmark, the policies may differ from country to country, I have seen some bad reviews here.Delivery is on time, They've got a great system for size-measurement. They've got Tall, Petite and Curvy categories, which have been a big help for me. When shopping for pants, I shop the tall section, so I can be sure that the pants aren't too short.The clothes are also greatly displayed on the website, with videos, and models sizes for reference.I haven't had a bad experience with them yet, but I've also not tried their customer service yet. (Never had to).I hope this review was useful to you. :)"
"April 01, 2019",1,SHOCKINGLY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Have used Asos for a number of years and always liked the products. However, I recently found out that when something goes wrong (the wrong item sent out to me) then they have THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCE!"

I‚Äôll be happy to delete the app for good and talking with all of my friends not to order from you.

"March 31, 2019",4,I figured I should share my experience..,"I figured I should share my experience with ASOS because their ratings seem to be low..anyways, this is my first time ordering from them. I purchased a pair of jeans. Overall, I love the jeans. They‚Äôre good quality and look like the picture. They fit perfectly as well (I used their fit guide quiz). My only complaint was that they look slightly different on me than the model, but that could be boiled down to height and body type. My order was estimated to arrive by April 3rd, and it actually came early on March 30th, which I was quite happy with because most people seem to be complaining about shipping. I did not pay the extra price for the express shipping, because in my experience, items never seem to arrive earlier, no matter the company."

Questionable quality some times but for the most part I am happy with everything. Made a ¬£150 order and received, as ordered, underwear with no hygiene label. I contacted customer service and was told that the item doesn't come with hygiene label. Little did the advisor know, I had already ordered them on a different account which came with a hygiene label. Advisor was blunt and unhelpful and this is a massive shame because I have been a loyal customer over the years and never once made a complaint.Now I am stuck with ¬£15 worth of underwear that I can't return and don't want to wear in case somebody else has worn. Minor issue but was handled poorly."
"March 30, 2019",1,absolutely terrible,absolutely terrible. ordered a present for my kids to give to their Mum on Mothers Day and still waiting for delivery so checked tracking and apparently my delivery address (which Asos have delivered to successfully before) is now insufficient.

"March 29, 2019",1,Despicable joke of a company.,"Despicable joke of a company.US sizes are way off. They do not offer exchanges, only returns and then you have to reorder. They‚Äôre almost always out of stock of the item when you do reorder. If they‚Äôre not, they don‚Äôt honor the original price you paid. If it was on sale or discounted when you bought it, but it‚Äôs no longer on sale (or if you used a discount code), then you have to pay the higher price for the new items. I‚Äôve never heard of any retailer doing this before. It‚Äôs a terrible business practice and is a scam considering the sizes are not correct. On top the their terrible policies, their customer support is completely unprofessional. They are rude, not helpful at all (they send a scripted answer to tell you they will look into it and then forward your request to someone else- why even bother having a chat line?), then they end the chat whenever they feel like it, without reaching a resolution or asking if you have additional questions. Stay away from this company and stick with brands that actually value their customers!!!"

"March 28, 2019",5,Go-to Shopping Site,I really don't know why ASOS is getting so many low reviews here. I have made countless purchases with them and never had a problem. I recently received a package from them that was missing one of the items I ordered. I emailed them about it and they responded quickly saying that it was out of stock and proceeded to process a refund for me. No biggie. They will always be my go-to for the latest trends and range for tall girls.
"March 28, 2019",5,My package got lost but they took care of it without giving me a headache,"I ordered from ASOS and the package got lost so I contacted their Customer Service and I got a very quick response. My problem was solved within two days, they refunded me the money and sent one of the items that I had ordered and they had in stock at this time without even charging me for delivery because of the inconvenience even though it was not their fault. I recommend as a place where customers are taken care of whenever they have a problem."
"March 28, 2019",1,BEWARE BUYER,BEWARE BUYER! I ordered three packages from ASOS! But customer service when i ask them about my item.

NO STAR AND BAD BAD BAD!!!
"March 27, 2019",1,Damaged clothing,"Received a pair of leggings with a stain on them, was told to get a quote from the dry cleaners which asos would then refund me for, I took the leggings to be cleaned but they couldn‚Äôt get the stain out so didn‚Äôt charge me. I really liked the leggings and could live with the stain so asked for a partial refund (which most other places would do) but no, not asos. I told them that I wanted the leggings but they still instructed me to return them and wait for them to come back in stock to be sent a replacement, which they couldn‚Äôt guarantee. Apparently they can‚Äôt process a partial refund but they can process a returns refund... they have made this such an ordeal"
"March 27, 2019",1,Will never shop there again,"Will never shop there again. First, it took almost 3 weeks to ship to me. Secondly, I returned everything but 3 items in my order (almost $150 worth of clothes). They have yet to receive my shipment and are claiming the prepaid shipping label that THEY PROVIDED is not enough for proof of shipment. This is pretty much fraud because no one drops off a package and then asks for proof of postage. I have never had any issues with any other online retailers like this and i use alot. I'm convinced this is how they are covering their expenses by frauding customers out of money.UPDATE: I went to UPS to try to get ""proof of postage""... although proof of postage (according to UPS) is the tracking number located on the label that ASOS should have access to. Even when I asked their customer service reps to send me the city of their warehouse so I could narrow down some tracking numbers, they refused. Basically, they aren't incentivized to find the return because they rather take my money than keep me as a customer. They are withholding information from me which is by definition fraud: ""Fraud involves the false representation of facts, whether by intentionally withholding important information or providing false statements to another party for the specific purpose of gaining something that may not have been provided without the deception.""Never shopping there again as I am out $150 and will definitely be returning the other half of my order I was planning on keeping (another $150) due to my poor experience."

I get why no refund without proof of shipping, but how about send me what I paid for!  If I had only received 3 items instead of 4, would you ask for proof is shipping? RIDICULOUS!!!I don't care how cute their clothes are...NEVER AGAIN!I am reporting them DIRECTLY to the US Federal Trade Commission!"
"March 27, 2019",2,Item did not arrive,"Was told my item will arrive in 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, I got notified that item is on the way, 1 week later the tracking website says the item has not moved.

I took her bait, and purchased the dress and made her pay the two day shipping.  A dress came....it was foam like and black and white striped!!!!  Not even ROSE QUARTZ!  Can employees see??   Well... the dress is needed, and they won't refund or send the right dress until the other is back which can take up to 10 days.....Sorry money should be refunded right away, or the right product sent right away!!!!!"
"March 26, 2019",5,One of the best on line companies,Fantastic range of products to suit all sizes and budgets. Ever increasing beauty product range is brilliant too.

"March 26, 2019",1,Items supplied different to those shown on site,"Asos used to sell good quality items and have excellent customer service. These days they sell disposable fashion with quality on par to Primark. With my most recent order I have received some shoes which are not the same as I ordered. Asos assure me the shoes are the same even though the colour and materials are different, the shoes delivered look like a poor quality copy. This seems a very strange customer service and shows what they actually think of their customers. I have completely lost any trust with Asos and would advise to avoid."

"March 25, 2019",3,Gone downhill,"I used to buy products from ASOS at least once a month- either for myself or partner.  I had an item due for next day delivery with DHL, but as this has now been over a week again (with the event it was needed for passed) it is safe to say I am unimpressed. After contacting ASOS with DHS‚Äô ludacris replies, the summed up response of ASOS was ‚Äònot our problem you‚Äôll get it when it gets there‚Äô.Safe to say they‚Äôve lost a good bit of business, I don‚Äôt have time for unreliable companies."

"March 25, 2019",1,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. Charged custom fees on my REPLACEMENT. They sent me a faulty swimsuit with an oil stain. Resent a new one no problem but then when I asked about why am I getting charged custom fees AGAIN and if they can reimburse these fees the most they can do is refund you once the replacement is sent back to them. They also have no phone customer service everything is online. The quality of my swimsuit is garbage. The swimsuit isn‚Äôt even swim material. Not worth the price I paid. Not impressed. Dhl the carrier service said they get complaints from customers all the time with packages from ASOS and asking to refuse the package because they don‚Äôt want to pay customs on replacement.
"March 25, 2019",1,What a shambles,"What a shambles, absolutely ridiculous experience trying to deal with customer service who would listen or couldn't understand my complaint just kept repeating the same info over and over again that had no relevance...

"March 25, 2019",4,Great online retailer,I have never had a problem with the delivery or return of my orders.Also really like the Fit Assistant that they provide when ordering clothes online to compare how an item will fit in comparison with my previous orders.Only downside was the recent decision to scrap the A List reward program.

It took 2 weeks to even arrive to my country, but it turned out that it had a big fee (which I didn't know about) so I told the shipping company to send it back. ASOS told them to destroy the package. It's a scam and you won't get your money back, don't buy from this site."
"March 25, 2019",1,First and last experience.,"Don‚Äôt waste your time- the cute clothes are not worth the arrogant customer service. I had a cart full of items ready to buy, but came across a technical difficulty while checking out (website couldn‚Äôt connect to payment services). Used the live chat function to notify the ASOS team of the problem, but they proceeded to tell me that they have not been notified of any website issues. Am I not notifying you of an issue? They had me clear my Cache, download their app, and check my internet connection, all of which were functioning properly. Then basically told me tough luck, and that there was nothing they could do with the very problem that could have been potentially costing them tons of sales. Lazy much? Took my sale elsewhere, and will never be shopping here again. Would check ur team, ASOS. I would never want someone like that on mine."
"March 24, 2019",2,Poor customer service,"Have had problems with orders going missing several times now - customer service very unhelpful on contacting them, do not seem to listen to the problem and give a generic reply telling you not to contact them again for a certain length of time.

After searching for weeks to find a place that‚Äôd do it, we had it fixed and they refunded the cost, however, immediately after, it ripped again.  The jacket fits her correctly, it‚Äôs just made of the thinnest and cheapest leather I‚Äôve ever put my hands on.

"March 22, 2019",2,Absurdly useless customer service,"I hate to echo all the other reviews here, but the customer service is just plain bad. they have been somewhat upfront about delays and being ""super busy"" which is not my gripe. The customer service is literally worthless. I ordered a jumpsuit for my graduation to my old address by mistake, but luckily the local post initiated a ""return to sender"" OVER A MONTH AGO. Now I can understand delays within ASOS, but I don't see how that would affect the courier which operates completely independent of them. I have reached out at least four times about this order and NEVER get an answer beyond some scripted malarkey, like they never tell me anything that I don't already know. And actually I've had to tell THEM to track the package via the original number so they can see its on its way back to them. They are absolutely useless and inconsiderate. Any other company would acknowledge that I've waited long enough for an order I never even touched (there's proof of that in the tracking), and go ahead and issue the refund. This is absolute madness! Also, now that I think about it how are you ""too busy"" to fulfill orders when that's literally what your business does!"

"March 22, 2019",1,Thinking of buying from ASOS? Maybe think again...,"I've been an ASOS customer for years, and despite quite a few issues cropping up I've remained loyal. I ordered a small item and paid a minimal amount for standard delivery, totalling around ¬£12. I thought something was a bit odd as the ASOS order page didn't change to 'we've sent it!' as it normally does when an order has been dispatched. So on the day of delivery I contacted ASOS via their online chat facility and asked what was happening: the first guy I spoke to said the order had definitely been dispatched, and that I should just wait. There was a lot of cut-and-paste going on. The second person I spoke to gave me a tracking number for Hermes and said that, although there appeared to be some delay, the order would definitely arrive by the end of the day. Much later on that day the Hermes tracking app was still showing 'there's a delay...' and so I contacted ASOS again via the chat facility, and experienced one of the most blunt and rude customer service interactions I've ever had (mixed in with yet more cut-and-paste customer service spiel, the exact same spiel as earlier, word for word). I was told to go away in no uncertain terms, and so I put in a complaint via email to their customer services department.Overnight the Hermes tracking app updated to show the ASOS order supposedly left the depot, and then it went straight back to the depot a few hours later. It didn't even leave the vicinity of ASOS. This has actually happened before, about a year ago. So I tried to log on to see if the order info had changed in my ASOS account, and was met with a page stating that my account was blocked due to 'suspicious activity'. When I managed to speak to someone at ASOS about this I was told that my account was being closed and that if the parcel ever did show up at their depot then it would take a further 7-10 days to process a refund, and I might receive the money eventually. Of course I can't check on the refund because I no longer have access to my account. Being made out to be some sort of fraudster acting in a suspicious, illegal manner has been really upsetting for me. I'm still a bit gobsmacked that this has happened, as I've never come across anything like this before. The order was a small treat for myself because I've been really unwell lately, and it's turned into a complete debacle.I have never been so disappointed in a company. I just really hope that someone from their Head Office takes the time to look at all of these negative reviews - let's face it, we can't all be wrong! - and tries to change the way ASOS does things."
"March 22, 2019",1,Another case of s**t customer service.,"In february i ordered a pair of leopard print boots along with 6 other items, when the order arrived i opened the boots box to find a pair of cheap and chatty looking snakeprint boots so i returned them (just human error i thought), however i have just made 2 orders for my son as he goes on holiday in 2 weeks time and one of the items was a pair of calvin klein sliders, again opened the box to find a cheaper pair of calvin klein flip flops so i immediately ordered a return and went to live chat (funny how they are always the cheaper version) . I was told to send them back and i would be refunded or could have an exchange once they recieved them back and investigated, i emailed to say my son was going away in 2 weeks needed these in a hurry and since this is second time its happened in a couple of months i wanted to put in a complaint, i got passed from pillar to post and was told to either wait for return to be handled, buy them again and ask for express delivery or use klarna, why the bloody hell should i have to do any of that when its asos whos at fault, they should have sent out the replacement as they were at fault, god sake man if you cant even pack a pair of bloody shoes right then theres something wrong, i dont know whats going on with these stores but they seriously need to work on their staff training and customer service, another retailer i will not be purchasing from again and iv been ordering at the very least ¬£100 a month of products.UPDATESo we returned the incorrect pair of shoes with it clearly marked on returns note that we wanted an exchange for the correct pair, as mentioned and also told to asos my son goes on holiday soon, well what would you know they have gone and refunded the shoes and not sent an exchange even though the correct sliders have been in stock all along, didnt think they could actually get any worse, got onto chat to be told id have to order them again and they would maybe refund delivery charge, well no thankyou ASOS il spend my money on a retailer who can actually do their job. I will be very surprised if you are still in business this time next year, we lose the voucher scheme then the service just goes to s**t, i know i will not be entertaining asos ever again.UPDATE 2Trustpilot is around for everyone to leave their own honest opinion, if you have had a good experience with a company then thats amazing (do diddly do for you)  but it doesnt mean everyone has had the same experience so just concentrate on your own reviews rather than disputing what other people write."

"March 22, 2019",1,Sent a previously worn dress....,I ordered this dress for an upcoming ready.I paid for Express shipping and received it on time. It's beautiful and fit great BUT had a horrible smell of body order!!! The tie around the waist has come apart. The tag is also bent as if they just tucked it in to hide it.I contacted customer service to inform them that they sent me a previously worn dress. They did not apologize but simply informed me to return the dress and re-oder a new one! Unfortunately I do not have time since the wedding is this weekend! The policy return on their website states that if you'd like to return your items but don't wear them because they inspect all thier returns! Which is a lie because they totally dropped the ball on this dress. POOR QUALITY CONTROL AND HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! This was my first ASOS purchase and my last!!!
"March 21, 2019",1,I‚Äôm absolutely annoyed to be writing‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôm absolutely annoyed to be writing this review because I used to LOVE asos I‚Äôve shopped with them for so so so long I‚Äôve ALWAYS bought premier delivery since I can remember!! I had to return one order because I ordered two different sizes and returned an item (this got refunded 3 days later EXACT) I was also returning another order which didn‚Äôt fit my partner on the same date, I didn‚Äôt receive a refund or an email to say they‚Äôd recieved it so I left it around another week, still nothing. So I tried emailing in today from their website (I tried this three times) but their website wouldn‚Äôt submit the online form.. so I decided to use the live chat to find out what‚Äôs happening, I explained this to ‚ÄúRHYS‚Äù who said she/he couldn‚Äôt give me any info because my live chat email was an old email and my asos email was my current email, i explained this to her/him and that it wouldn‚Äôt let me sign out so it wouldn‚Äôt show an email so he could then let me get some info (doesn‚Äôt really make sense because I could still be anyone) and it wouldn‚Äôt let me change the chat email to my current and asked if he could then just email my current email which is linked to my asos account and I could then reply back so they know it‚Äôs me, she/he totally ignored that and just went crazy copy and pasting their scripts they use and saying he couldn‚Äôt email an email that isn‚Äôt on my account (so they basically ignored what I had said to them after I‚Äôd explained the email on my account is the one I want him to message and NOT the live chat one) anyway he also said that they could only give me info if I could sign out of live chat (which it doesn‚Äôt let me) which means that should go against their ‚Äúrules‚Äù too I could be anyone or contact them on social media which anyone can make up a social media account or some don‚Äôt even hav social media! I explained that it‚Äôs private and I didn‚Äôt want to use it just to contact them and say the same stuff as I am now.. I also explained that I‚Äôve had trouble before and that the person before literally just emailed my current email that‚Äôs linked to my account so I could reply there and prove ITS ME! I even sent over the proof of postage and still wasn‚Äôt willing to help me. They started saying they couldn‚Äôt send an email unless it was the one on the system and that they can‚Äôt help me further and closed the chat... so they basically just went against what I‚Äôd asked them to do and admitted in the end she/he could just email the email id asked her/him to email!!! So to get my money back I had to contact them on social media.. Now i thought my expectations from their customer service team couldn‚Äôt get any worse, oh I was so WRONG! Anyway! I contacted them explained EVERYTHING again, and sent over the screenshots to show the website wouldn‚Äôt let me send an email from there, sent the screenshots from useless RYHS to show id asked them to send an email to the email on the system and refused. And explained that I‚Äôm getting annoyed and shouldn‚Äôt have to use my social media, I mean there‚Äôs still a few people out their with the same name as me I still could be anyone so I‚Äôve no idea what difference it made contacting them on social media than when I was on live chat! Just basically wasting my time.. so first I spoke to Paul! He literally read my message and I know he looked at the images because he located my order number from them, and asked me to give him my email that‚Äôs linked to the account in order to talk about my order for security reasons (whch i gave this to RHYS) and then said if I didn‚Äôt know this and needed changing to go change it in my settings I could. So I gave him it! I explained again that I didn‚Äôt need to change anything on my asos account and advised that the fault lies in live chat and explained the difference between both emails and which is on live chat and which is linked to my asos! So a little while later I got a message from Adam now and said he needed my my order number (which I explained earlier his colleague even quoted my order number as well as being in the screenshots I sent over) so this Adam didn‚Äôt read the previous chat OR look at the images. So to adam I explained this AGAIN and asked if one person could please deal with this so I can stop explaining I advised that everything is in the chat! Then last but least another person replied just to say they‚Äôve now sent the information over to their specialist team and I have to wait for another 48 hours for a reply. So I literally went through all that today which RYHS could have just sent the information over to their specalist team at the start and they would then email the correct email! Just a joke and I‚Äôm done with asos, I‚Äôll just miss some of their clothes. :)EDIT - Now I understand why asos have such bad reviews on trustpilot, their customer service team either need sacking or putting back into training, this is coming from someone who‚Äôs worked in marketing and customer service! I would‚Äôve got sacked if I had their attitude towards their customers."
"March 21, 2019",1,Worst customer service ever,"Worst customer service I've ever experienced. Sent incorrect size, and then requested I ship the item back and wait 28 days for refund. Didn't offer any solutions, compensation or benefits, let alone correct size. Now shirt is out of stock and I have pajama pants with no top."
"March 21, 2019",1,I wouldn't even give Asos 1 star if I‚Ä¶,I wouldn't even give Asos 1 star if I had the choice. Absolutely shocking customer service. Hermes lost my parcel which they have confirmed by email. Asos asked me to wait till a certain date to see if its delivered which obviously it hasn't been. And they keep pushing the date back in which I am supposed to contact them.They wouldn't chase up with Hermes where my parcel was I had to. And now I'm just getting constantly fobbed off. My credit card bill is due on the 4th of next month. So I have that to pay and no goods.I WANT MY REFUND!!
"March 21, 2019",3,So-so,+ fast delivery to Russia. - prices and the quality is questionable.

The clothes selection is nice and that's why I go back HOWEVER, they probably have the worst customer service I ever had to deal with. The brand does not care at all about their customers satisfaction, helping you resolve issues, providing solutions. I just had a very annoying interaction with a customer service rep on the live chat, after providing no help and going back and forth for 50 mins, he closed the chat on me. Very frustrating."
"March 20, 2019",1,Lost loyal customer over $30,"After MULTIPLE orders with the company, received the item and returned for bigger size. Bigger size item arrived, but the return/refund for smaller item has never been processed. Contacting the company returned nothing. I should have taken a picture of the company-provided return label as they do not have any info on that! They WILLINGLY lost a loyal customer over $30! Do not shop there!"
"March 20, 2019",3,I ordered a dress for an event weeks in advance....,"I ordered a dress for an event weeks in advance, Asos had a spend ¬£50+ free standard delivery deal on so I assumed as I had over two weeks it'll arrive on time. Asos dispatched the item pretty fast and it was scanned into the trackable delivery system (Hermes), estimated for within 5days of dispatch, it didn't arrive. I attempted to contact Asos only finding ""live Chat"" so I spoke to a member of their team who just stated there has been a problem with the delivery company and it will arrive in two days time, she said she will update the tracking and I will receive an email stating this change, this I didn't receive (also checking my Junk folders) .Another week passed of waiting (as well as the event) so I decided I wanted to cancel the order, as I had purchased an alternative dress from another company, so I spoke to another member of their team via live chat and asked if it was possible to cancel the order as the event the dress was required for had passed, he stated: He understands and has passed it onto a specialist team that will contact me within 72 hours. I then received an email two days later saying they've refunded  the amount and it will appear 5-10days in my bank, it arrived the next day so I cannot fault them for this as its their chosen delivery company that are at fault. However, I would strongly prefer a number to call rather than live chat having my first live chat attempt fail and having absolutely zero outcome from it!"
"March 19, 2019",1,Wouldn‚Äôt ever buy again.,I recently ordered a few items and jackets from ASOS. It was supposed to be at my house .. latest March 8 2019. They followed up and said my package was shipped yet they obviously hadn‚Äôt shipped it as the tracking number was invalid. It‚Äôs march 20th and I still haven‚Äôt had a follow up for where my package is or why it was so late when I paid for shipping. Wouldn‚Äôt buy from them.
"March 19, 2019",1,Wrong item sent and it takes forever to receieve refund!!!!,"I ordered from them for the first time and how was i disappointed when i receive my order. One pair was to big, which understandable since i bought it online. But second pair wasn't even close to the pictures on the web site. I returned the items. And on the web site it says that i was suppose to receive my refund 14 business days after they receive the package. After 20 business days there was no refund. I tried to contact then through email - no response. After couple days i contacted them via chat, since there is no phone to call, and i receive it response that my case will be passed on to their specialist  and i will receive update in 72 hours. I will never buy from them again."

"March 19, 2019",1,Don't pay ¬£5.95 for 'Next Day‚Ä¶,"Don't pay ¬£5.95 for 'Next Day Delivery'... Last weekend (it was a Saturday) I put an order in for something I needed for Monday, for a trip away. So I paid for the 'next day delivery' which ensured me that I would receive my parcel the very next day on Sunday. Great! Wrong. I am a bit of a bargain hunter, so to spend anything on delivery is a treat for me! But more importantly, when I do put my money to something I expect the particular service promised. It got to Sunday and there was no news of my delivery, so I checked on the website and it was still at the depot. I contacted the customer support chatline and was told it was out for delivery today. When I told them that it had not even left the depot, they told me it definitely had left and was out for delivery. So I then had to explain that it was not showing up on the Hermes website tracking service and I wanted to know if my parcel did not get delivered today that I would receive a full refund for my delivery charges. They left the chat. Long story short, I went onto another chat with someone else, and then someone else, and was told I (the customer who paid extra for next day delivery) may have to wait up until midnight on a Sunday... Really? Do I? Is Midnight not Monday?!I decided to not throw my laptop across the room out of pure frustration from wasting my afternoon and came to the conclusion that I would not receive my order that day. All in all, this is about a service to millions of people that keep your company running and you don't seem to have cracked it with your customer service or your own delivery rules! You can not treat your customers as if they are lucky to receive their orders at all! It really is a disorganised disgrace. You should care for the individual customer and not just the masses...Or at least try and make it feel that way!"
"March 19, 2019",1,Ordered several items that I waited to‚Ä¶,"Ordered several items that I waited to arrive on Christmas but I never received them. I have no idea if they have been seized by customs or got lost, but I received my refund. Not ordering from them again."
"March 19, 2019",3,"Good products, substandard delivery...","I just ordered from ASOS for the first time and was so happy with the app and selection (and prices). When my order was about a week past the estimated delivery date, I came onto Trust Pilot to read some reviews and immediately started to panic. Normally I‚Äôd check reviews before buying but I knew ASOS has been around for a while, and since many Instagram influencers promote ASOS I didn‚Äôt see much reason to investigate until after the late delivery. Anyway, I went to customer service right away and they weren‚Äôt helpful at all. They had no way of tracking my package and couldn‚Äôt even tell me when it had left the UK. They basically just extended the delivery time and told me to contact them if I still hadn‚Äôt received my items after that date. I was very short with the rep and feel a bit bad about it now because the package did actually show up within a week after contacting them. I ordered two tops and a belt and love all 3 (all ASOS brand). The quality is good and they‚Äôre as pictured on the site. I will consider ordering again based on the fact that shipping and duties were free and I ended up happy with my items, but the delivery time and overall delivery system is substandard. I would definitely not order from ASOS if you‚Äôre banking on having the items in time for a specific occasion, unless you‚Äôre ordering months in advance."

"March 18, 2019",1,What happened??,"Ordered a jump-suit on the 11'th of June. I still haven't received it,  and it is now the 1'st of July. They withdrew the money almost immediately. Costumer service (chat) is super unhelpful and I suspect that one is chatting to robots and not actual people -it‚Äôs always the same replies that are not Useful at all.I have shopped at ASOS for YEARS! but the last couple of times have been such a hassle; I don't think I am going to be shopping with Asos any more. They've lost it."
"March 18, 2019",1,Very untrustworthy company BEWARE,"Their clothes are quite fashionable, but not always great quality.However, their customer service is probably the worst I have ever experienced.There are no telephone numbers and their agents are not helpful via chat.Their shipping dates aren't trustworthy and reimbursement for returns have taken close to 3 months.Even though their prices are cheap, you will pay for it in frustration because this company is not trustworthy or honest."
"March 17, 2019",1,Very bad experience,"Very bad experience : Hey ASOS , I‚Äôve subscribed to your premium next day delivery. My items were supposed to be delivered today , and I find out on the website of the third party you use ( Hermes ) that they tried to deliver today and I wasn‚Äôt IN ??? I was at home the entire day , and I have a concierge 24/7  who receives all deliveries...Since your customer service confirmed that you have no ownership of your deliveries, ASOS will now be at the queue of my e-commerce choices... Not good enough."
"March 17, 2019",1,This company is a fraud,"This company is a fraud. After over three weeks of not getting my order, I had to get into contact with 3 associates, none of which can be reached over the phone so it takes an excessive amount of time. Only to find out that apparently all three of the items I ordered were now out of stock. I guess they were just never going to tell me had I not reached out so many times. Apparently, my refund will occur in 5-7 days but I'm worried that they will even follow through with that after this horrible experience.  I explained to the associate, Adam,  that I would be writing negative reviews and he really did not seem to care, only stating that he'd be happy to pass the feedback along and that I could close the chat if I was done. Overall, AWFUL experience and I will never EVER order from here again."
"March 17, 2019",1,Awful,"Awful! I'v made up to 20 orders just this past 3 months, every order was late at least a week. Their customer support is rubbish they would reply on my emails with only 2 templates regardless your questions. Today I asked for a refund since my order was supposed to be here 11 days ago and despite the fact that I wrote 7 emails trying to explain that this is not ok, and if they have no control over the delivery time they should not give me an estimate. All their replies were about me allowing them some more time until I get my order wich is absurd. Do not spend your money on this company, time wasting and frustrating."

I ordered 4 items from ASOS on Wednesday afternoon, paying extra for next day delivery as I needed my clothes to come on Thursday because I need to wear them for Friday. I arrived home late after school on Thursday and checked my email to see that my order couldn‚Äôt be delivered as they was supposedly no one home. Firstly there were people at home and secondly I do not understand the reason WHY it couldn‚Äôt have been dropped to my neighbours as that was my second option on DPD for if there was nobody at home as they claimed. Yet they failed to do this.I tried to log into Asos and find what would happen to my parcels now and this was absolutely impossible to do. It said I had to pay extra ¬£10 to resend my order which is a complete and utter disgusting cheat! I tried to contact Asos but it wouldn‚Äôt allow me and I had to deal with my order coming two days after the day I wanted it.THIS IS ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING AND SICKENING. Your service is complicated and difficult for no reason whatsoever you need to fix it. UTTERLY DISAPPOINTED. I do not recommend this place"

"March 15, 2019",1,Do yourself a favour and don't bother with Asos,"I don't know why I've continued to use Asos over the past year because time and time again they offer the worst customer service experience of my life. I paid to be a premium member which means free next day delivery (they took away all the other perks associated with premium so that's all it basically pays for now) but they continue to associate with the farce delivery service that is Hermes and it seems to be a 50:50 possibility of my orders actually coming, or not. Obviously when this happens Asos customer service do not care one bit. This most recent order, did arrive the next day to my pleasant surprise however they sent me the wrong item. I contacted Customer Services who helpfully did a little copy/paste number of the returns info saying that I can ask for an exchange - not really acceptable to say that I have to go out of my way to return an item I didn't even buy and then we can keep our fingers crossed that the item remains in stock long enough for them to send it out? Knowing Asos, the item will have long sold out. When I said I didn't want to do that, and expressed my dismay at having to make another purchase of the same order whilst awaiting a refund (after I've wasted my own time arranging to get it returned), they helpfully suggested that I just use Klarna to 'pay later' - this involves a credit check so it's pretty irresponsible and inappropriate to suggest that to me. Another time I had placed an order and forgotten to use my discount code that they had sent me. Could Customer Services help in any way? Nope! When my order didn't arrive? Nope! I just don't understand what the purpose of Asos customer service is because if I wanted a wall of text about their terms and conditions, I'd just read that on their website. I wouldn't even be convinced that they are human beings if they didn't take several minutes to compose the most basic of responses. Sometimes I'll make an order and then I find out later that it's been cancelled because the item is actually not in stock, what's that all about? In what instance SHOULD I be contacting Asos Customer Service where they might actually be able to assist in any way? Sure sometimes the items are nice but overall the nightmare that is the customer service experience has a whole makes me so incredibly frustrated that I'd sooner not shop there at all. Shame as Asos could be amazing but they have zero customer service skills to the point where I will look elsewhere from now on."

It has been 15 March and my courier has been stuck in customs for more than a month due to incomplete documentation from the company. The courier company that has dealing with my order in India (Delhivery) asked me to fill form 12B ( this form is required for cosmetic clearance in India). And now my form has got rejected by the government site of India that deals with drug clearance stating that form 12B is applicable only for import of small quantity drugs for personal use prescribed by the doctor and not for cosmetic drugs.Really disappointed. I will not shop from asos again especially for ordering any cosmetics.

I‚Äôve used plenty of online shopping websites and this is one of the worst I‚Äôve ever experienced, even compared to China websites. ASOS has been by far getting worse and worse in delivery issues, customer service and quality. Trust me and save your money and a headache. This has been numerous times that I‚Äôve given them a chance and ordered an item which was not delivered and they tell me to knock door to door to ask my neighbors if they‚Äôve received it or to check with the post office. Once my order was 2 months late and they finally found out it wasn‚Äôt even shipped because it stayed at the warehouse and they had charged my account."

I live in LA and there is no chance I order items to be delivered to Delaware, where I haven‚Äôt been in my life. There wasn‚Äôt tracking number with the order summary.  Contacted their customer service vie online chat, the lady told me that the items are dispatched and  they can do nothing. She instead of trying to resolve the issue, which apparently was a glitch of their website, I got a long training on how to buy items in the FUTURE. No practical ideas how to resolve the current one, yet I got a very extensive  training from an ASOS  rep on future orders. To all my explanations that The rep also lied to me, she told me that the items are dispatched (was March 10)and nothing they can do about it. She could not provide me with a tracking number though,  yet in 3  days (March 13) I got an automated message that the items are dispatched and will be delivered in 7 days and they provided me with a tracking number. I checked the number it really was dispatched on March 13 and to be delivered to a Delaware. She basically was lying the whole time, that items are dispatched. She refused to provide any phone number so I can contact ASOS and talk directly, so we aren‚Äôt  back and force through messenger, she also refused to escalate the issue to any supervisor. she was just having fun of me. The only feeling I got from the 1 hour e-conversation with her was that she is having fun of me, never experienced that, HORRIBLE FEELING THAT SOMEBODY IS JUST HAVING FUN OF YOU. At the end she ended the conversation, as I contacted them to sell an insurance."

"March 14, 2019",1,By far the worst customer service I‚Äôve ever received,"Great selection of clothes and fast delivery times, but if you ever need to contact them for help then just don‚Äôt bother. Had my first issue in November 2016 where my parcel was never delivered, just sent back to ASOS and refunded. Messaged them - this got ignored.Called them, waited 45 minutes on the line and then the agent answered and hung up.Never bothered contacting them again.Next issue January 19th I ordered 14 dresses totalling ¬£411 as they were on sale and I wanted to pick 2 for weddings I had throughout the year.Package arrived with only 6 dresses inside. Called DPD who asked if the parcel looked damaged. It did, it had DPD tape on it.He advised me to contact ASOS so they could open an investigation.Contacted Asos at least 6 times over the space of nearly a month. I always had to chase them for an update after their promised times. I couldn‚Äôt understand why I was left out of pocket for dresses that they had lost. This should be dealt with between ASOS and the delivery company, having no customer impact.I was left ¬£411 out of pocket for 3.5 weeks as they ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt do anything until the investigation with DPD was concluded‚Äù.After me hounding then again, they just refunded the money for the missing dresses.I then received an email after the refund as procsssed to say that they checked stock for the missing dresses and don‚Äôt have any of them in my size anymore. THEY HAD LISTED THE WRONG DRESSES. I checked myself and some of the dresses were in stock.I explained this to an agent over email twice who replied with the exact same answer and the exact same list of dresses. I asked to complain to which I was told ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have a complaints process or managers‚Äù. I replied again that this was ludicrous and I got no response and my case was shut down.It‚Äôs now the 14th of March and I am STILL waiting on my refund of the other dresses which I returned. Still ¬£116 out of pocket due to their incompetence.Their customer service is one of the worst I‚Äôve seen so just hope everything goes right with your order!"

But i recieved them only 14th March. The costumer service is bad, because they don't correctly answer your questions in particular where is the orders, because they don't have the tracking information. But in orders information they were! My orders came directly what i ordered, but the lack of tracking information and customer service inspired me to put 4 stars. P.S. Their Asos design wear has good very good quality for it's price."

So when I returned and purchased the other size, I was only refunded the value of the item, minus the e50.Upon contacting customer care, I basically got the same excuse 5 different ways... not sure if it's a machine that churns out the responses coz a person should be able to apply common sense a√±d logic, to know that I should be refunded the full value of the item. The unfortunate thing is that I was lining up to purchase more items from the store but now after this, for the sake of e50 ... they will lose sales from me of ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨, that's why their customer care is useless."

ASOS have told me to wait 2 weeks for it to turn up even though it had been confirmed to be missing. Now they are telling me to wait another 5 days while they look into it. Packages are late all the time with ASOS but not like this. Their procedures are terrible compared to other companies

Bad customer service they sent me a wrong item I paid express shipping, custom fees and on top of course the item but when I received it, guess what? it was the wrong one so I contacted them and they told me to pay the sipping to send them back and purchase a new one and they are not going to refund my custom fees! Not even for the shipping and so on... Can you imagine what service is that? Basically for their mistake I need to pay twice the custom plus shipping and wait 30 or more days for a refund or  I need to purchase a new one and pay all over again all the fees plus shipping!!! I'm so furious right now this is a scam!!! DON'T BUY THERE I will definitely report them!"
"March 12, 2019",1,such a waste of money :(,"I never write reviews for stores but I felt like I had to for ASOS. There are many, many bad reviews out there on ASOS but I saw a few good ones and took a risk anyway. It did not pay off.I spent 100 dollars on a dress that came in and looked like a literal costume. Nothing like the picture. An awful cheap material and stitching.I also got a white bodysuit. The material was so thin you could see my belly button through it. Also, my clothing all had an awful smell to it.. I will be returning for a refund. I feel like this brand clearly spends money on their site making their products look legit so it‚Äôs such a shame they don‚Äôt care about quality. DO NOT SHOP FROM ASOS"

Keep getting told my info i provided was wrong and then when i went on another chat USING THE SAME INFO they tell me there is a delay. I don't even know how ASOS are still running with all the bad reviews already on here! Oh i bet i won't get my items for a few months whilst you run with my money. ABSOLUTE JOKE.
"March 12, 2019",1,Appalling Customer Service,"Their customer service is appalling. I pay for next day delivery yet every time they use Hermes to send my deliveries, they don't come the next day due to Hermes' horrific service. Asos' customer service don't do anything about it and say to wait until the next day. If I have paid for next day delivery, it is down to them to make sure I get my parcels the next day, but instead take no responsibility. No wonder their company is failing massively and they always have to throw everything out on sale. Can't see Asos still being a thing this time next year."

Ordered a dress last week and just got notification  almost a week later that it‚Äôs out of stock.  It should have been shipped and received by now, especially since I paid for 2 day premier shipping.

"March 11, 2019",1,The worst online shopping experience.,"By far, the worst online shopping experience I've ever had. I was always suspicious about asos and never liked it's aesthetic but I saw some cute tops and I said to myself ""why not try it, worst case scenario I will return the things I don't like, just like any other online shop, right?"". Well, nuh-huh! The clothes were so much different than the photos, very poorly made and totally different colours. Their customer service is non existent. In case you want to return something, well you better pray to Jesus, or Krishna, or Kukulkan, or any other omnipotent being humanity has ever worshiped, to get your refund. I have returned my order since the 14th of February and contacted them twice regarding the parcel's whereabouts, but I never got a clear answer. All their employees told me to wait another week and if the parcel got lost it is my responsibility for choosing the returns method suggested by their site.So, long story short, I just got scammed out of my money. This company is awful and I hope it crumbles to the ground along with its rude and bad mannered employees :)"
"March 11, 2019",3,ASOS/Yodel,"ASOS website is very good, easy to use and ordering my products was straightforward. The issues was with the delivery - ASOS uses the courier Yodel. I paid extra for a shorter delivery and my delivery information stated my order would arrive in two days (a Saturday) which was great as I needed the products by Sunday to showcase them to the bride of the wedding I am part of. However, when tracking my delivery despite the ASOS tracking saying Saturday, Yodel tracking said Monday. Obviously, the parcel was not delivered Saturday. On Monday whilst out, I received a message from Yodel saying my delivery was left in a 'safe' place, but when I arrived home it was left in plain site at my front door. This isn't safe at all and anyone could pick it up! Despite this I am happy with the products even though I will have to now wait to visit the bride when we are both free again."

Their site also recommended me this size according to my measurements.When I received the dress I wasn't able to zip it up.It was very small and the fabric had no stretch.When I contacted their customer service the only answer I got that I have to return the dress to get refunded.The only problem is that Canad post has very high shipping costs abroad so it's not worth for me to pay so much for the shipping.They couldn't care less about this problem and didn't offer me any discounts  or partial refunds.This was my last time of buying from this site.

"March 09, 2019",2,Horrible return process,"So...I'm part of a wedding party and there was some blazer I had to order from Asos. Unfortunately, the blazer (by Noose & Monkey) had a few noticeable marks on the right and left shoulders, so I started to the return / exchange process. First off I was surprised that I had to pay for return shipping, but I was told it would be reimbursed after reviewing the item (so no biggie), but it definitely wasn't clear on their ReBOUND return site (Asos partners/works with I guess). Secondly, I could only find digital communications to deal with them (live chat, email, etc) but no phone, which made the whole process challenging expressing the problem and providing clear options. In comparison to other companies like amazon, zara, etc. (which are great) I found the return process is absolutely atrocious with Asos. I then find out there's none of the item left in my size (i.e. screwed for the wedding), so I'm then stuck with the defects and meanwhile I already kicked off the shipping label return process and paid for the shipping. Given the situation, I conceded and asked for them just to refund the return shipping costs which I didn't utilize / render the services and they were unable to refund the return shipping costs unless I sent the garment in, which wasn't an option given I need to secure for the wedding. Escalated and disputed the charge with Visa to deal with their shenanigans, which based on the ReBOUND terms of conditions and Asos', they're in the wrong. Last time I'll ever purchase anything from them."
"March 09, 2019",1,Thickos working for Asos,"Bought a pair of jeans and a cardigan, I sent back the jeans which was ¬£19.99 but they refunded me for the cardigan instead (how could they possibly make that mistake?) which was ¬£16. I contacted them which went on for weeks and they kept saying they already refunded the ¬£3.99 they owed me but they never did. They then said there's nothing else they can do. I had to open a PayPal dispute because I am ¬£3.99 out of pocket. It was my first time buying from Asos and will be the last. Nothing but problems. I think they done this on purpose and they will continue to do it to other customers too. Avoid Asos at all costs! It's run by thickos!"
"March 09, 2019",1,Thieves!,"I contacted Asos 16 working days ago, and enquired about a parcel they stated was delivered, it has been 16 working days and they have no resolved my issue. Instead, they have asked me to wait 24-48 hours after sending over 70 emails, twitter DM's, Facebook DM's and Instagram DM's. 24-48 hours equals 16 working days every time I ask them to sort this out they tell me to wait 24-48 hours. I have asked them to sort this out, to send me the order I paid ¬£180 for!They still have my ¬£180 and have not sent me my items! I have requested a refund and they are refusing to do so! Stay away from ASOS they are thieves and their customer service if you can even call it that is disgusting, They ignored you for days and when they do respond to you they quote the incorrect order number/name/address breach of GDPR?

They will not be here(California) until March 18. Customer service allegedly refunded me my eight dollars. Currently my item is sitting in Indianapolis, where it's been for three days now. Left warehouse in Georgia, two days later it was in Indianapolis. God knows when it will leave there. Don't be fooled by the top location link on Google. This is not a reputable company. From reading all the other one star reviews, it looks like I'll be lucky if I get the item, or eventually get my money back in the form of a refund because the shoes never arrived."

When contacting them they say they tell when checking out it‚Äôll take longer. Who gives a ‚Äúf‚Äù! Don‚Äôt offer 2 day shipping if it‚Äôs not true! Tell your customers the truth!!

It got pushed back, it got pushed back again and again. I now found another pair of shoes and reached out to them yet again stating to refund my money since the package was no where near here. They stated that they could not refund money and to wait UNTIL THE END OF ANOTHER MONTH. So ridiculous."
"March 06, 2019",1,Shipping sucks,"Shipping is taking forever. I was supposed to have received my stuff by now but it's now been pushed back by a month. The date of delivery keeps changing when I check the service updates. I'd heard of ASOS before and hadn't read the shipping reviews, but I seriously wish I had. Only reason I'm not getting a refund is because I don't fit into a lot of clothing where I live and I'm forced to shop online for most of my clothing. Come on, ASOS. Do better."

Obviously could not be bothered to deal with any customer enquiry first hand.After 6 days, I told them I was no longer interested in receiving the items, they were too late, I was told then that it would take up to two weeks for the return and another 2 weeks to get my refund, so ASOS just have hold of my money for up to 6 weeks now.All in all, terrible delivery, unhelpful customer service, waste of time.I've since asked to close my account, they haven't even bothered to respond to me."

Recently I have also fallen victim to this two-day shipping scam that everyone else on trustpilot has been complaining about. I had ordered some items on the 1st of March for my trip since i'm leaving town early in the morning on the 8th. At first I was disappointed since I knew the clothes I would order probably couldn't reach my house in time for my trip but then I thought there was some hope at the end of the tunnel when I saw their option for two day shipping. I was willing to spend $7.99 just to make sure I'd get it on time. The package took THREE full days to even ship out. ASOS's estimated delivery was on the 6th yet I doubt it will arrive tomorrow based on Fedex's estimated delivery on March 11th. This is unacceptable for ASOS and the site has definitely lost my trust from now on.The first costumer service person I contacted was absent for a total of 14 minutes of going between them ""typing"" or just complete silence. Their final solution was a generic copy-pasted ""we are busier than usual, sorry"" type response. The second costumer service person was a bit nicer and offered more solutions and even gave me a discount code for the trouble."

They had increased their US time-frame for shipping to add another week, so I was going to have to wait twice the time than my first order.  They let me know that up front so no huge deal.  Two weeks for shipping still seemed a bit long.  But then my order did not even ship out until the day it was supposed to arrive.  There was not communication for this and having to wait 2.5 weeks for one item is ridiculous.  And naturally nothing they could offer to make up for the incident."
"March 05, 2019",1,APPALLING DISHONESTY,"I paid extra for expedited 2 day shipping and now my order is over a month late. Customer service is NON-EXISTENT. There is no-one to speak to, they wont give me my money back and I still do not have my order. The ""chat"" support is a joke. They have pre-typed answers they just automatically respond with, without actually trying to help in the least bit. (The answer to everything is"" please bear with me whilst I look into this for you"" and the only resolution they offer is  ""Rest assured your order will be with you very soon"".)I am absolutely disgusted."

I‚Äôve been waiting over 3 weeks for this last order I placed and ASOS just keeps telling me to hold out a little longer. It‚Äôs a $400 order of maternity clothes and honestly the baby will probably be here before the order. I plan on returning everything just on the basis of how many times I‚Äôve been lied to and rudely dealt with this time around. Absolutely appalling. Will never use ASOS again, ever. Good luck with that Atlanta warehouse guys! From the looks of this site I‚Äôm not the only customer you‚Äôve lost recently! Cheers."

I rang ASOS who said they can't help me and to ring the courier company.  Apparently they can't get involved!  Courier company said to call ASOS.  The response I got from customer service ""What do you expect me to do?""  First and VERY LAST time I will be using this awful company"

They sent me the wrong size of the item which was on sale and refused to send me the right one (because it was not on sale anymore). Totally unprofessional and not to say that from 2 orders in 6 months they f*cked up both of them. Now I don't have my money and item either. Shame! No more orders from ASOS.

I paid extra for express shipping and like others reviewing ASOS, was screwed over. I needed this $50 jacket for a birthday trip to Vegas and it won‚Äôt be here until 2 weeks later than advertised to me. Just upset because never do I ever plan on wearing the item besides my birthday and it won‚Äôt be here. I won‚Äôt buy from ASOS again."
"March 05, 2019",1,Avoid at all cost -10/10,As you can see below - customer services is terrible. It is the same response over and over again as they do not have power to do anything.Delivery was supposed to be express - however it takes them even longer than the standard shipping to deliver the item. If you want your items - may want to be aware that it may come 1 month or 2 months after your order.Unacceptable service from a business that has been around for a while.
"March 04, 2019",1,10/10 Do not recommend,Package was supposed to arrive 2 weeks ago I ordered it over 4 weeks ago and when I emailed they said there is nothing they can do and told me that it's in the hand of my postal company (who can't help me because they never got the order) Now I'm probably going to have to call my credit card company to cancel it :(
"March 04, 2019",1,Service Lately Is TERRIBLE,"Like many people I have been shopping with ASOS for years. However, my last few orders have been the worst experience. I too have the 2 Day service and did not receive my items even remotely close to the time. The customer service reps continue to say that the warehouse is busy and that it was sent out express, when clearly it wasn't. I personally called the carrier and they said ASOS DID NOT send it express. Yet the ASOS reps keep saying ""our systems show that we mailed it express."" While I have spent a lot of money over the years with ASOS, I too will no longer buy anything from there as clearly ASOS is not willing to hold themselves accountable for the recent crap job that they have done."
"March 04, 2019",1,Horrible customer service,Horrible customer service.  Will not let me cancel an order that has obviously been lost in transit until a 5-day investigation happens.  I had to contact my credit card company to get my money back!

As I used a money off voucher for ¬£30 they essentially invalidated it after I returned an item? This should not have been the case, money off would have still been valid without the purchase.Expect to be ignored, and given basic uncaring responses."
"March 04, 2019",1,unacceptable service,"Very very upset with how customer service handles things. I have been waiting ten days for a package that I paid 2 day shipping for and was told I need to wait another week and then contact them if I still haven't received it. My event I needed the package for has long passed. Why would they offer 2 day shipping it they can't even come close to that and then just say you have to continue to wait, sorry. Not how a business should be ran. If you pay for a service, you should receive that service."
"March 04, 2019",4,only downfall was delivery,I was skeptical at first because of all these reviews but decided to take the risk since the product was not expensive. The only downfall to my expierence was the two day delivery was actually one week. Other than that everything went smooth. I was able to return the item and got a refund within 10 days.
"March 04, 2019",1,I'm really angry with ASOS,"I'm really angry with ASOS sent my clothes to my old address in another city. They sent them to my previous address despite my last few orders being sent to where I live now. I shouldn't have to check for mistakes every step of the way using their service, it's unreasonable. Also I shouldn't have to keep changing the currency from GBP to AUD dollars. There were also glitches loading this chat for complaints (Feedback). Now I don't know how to get my clothes. Spend some money on UX"

After ten days no reply i chatted with another of their agent who told me the same story that I will have to give him five working days to get in touch with the delivery guys so I told him that that was what his colleague said to me ten days ago,by now click and collect should have gotten back to you or dont you keep records of your customer complaints?I said ok, i will give you another five days but after five days if I dont get my order I want my money back and then the agent said no I wont get my money back unless I return the order, so I said, return what order ? I dont even have the order so how am I going to return what I have not received. This is the 10th day after that chat and yet I have not received my order, now I iam going to file claims in claims court because this kind of services is appalling and unacceptable in business. I went to the click and collect shop and I was told that click and collect has not delivered any parcel for the past two weeks, these guys are crazy, complete lunatics."
"March 03, 2019",1,Another ASOS scam,"Fraudsters, pure and simple!

There isn't enough fake 5 star reviews for you to buy to cover up the utter gutter of a company that you are. Customer Service is ...just non-existent...rude and dismissive"

CONS- I‚Äôve noticed the quality in their own brand isn‚Äôt very good. The ‚ÄòASOS design‚Äô.  all seem to shrink, lose shape, after one wash. I‚Äôve stopped buying their own stuff now. Especially T-shirt‚Äôs and dresses. - they got rid of their A LIST club, I thought this was a lovely way to give back to customers. It made them stand out from the rest."
"March 03, 2019",1,Incomplete delivery and from there just downwards,"Ordered a maternity package and only 1 of the 4 items arrived, a dress. They told me I need to send back the dress and order the package again but it‚Äôs sold out. I can‚Äôt even keep the dress unless I pay the full amount for all items. And when I send back the dress there is not even a way they‚Äôre going to sell it again as part of an incomplete package so for their business it‚Äôs just harming customer satisfaction without any financial benefit. They make a mistake and I get the effort to fix it, send it back, ensure I get a refund, and not even have the only item I actually did get. Do not recommend ordering here. First time I leave a bad review on Trustpilot so not one of those always complaining, but really disappointed about the lack of customer focus."
"March 03, 2019",5,No issues,"Not sure why there are so many bad reviews on here, I‚Äôve never had an issue with Asos. I‚Äôve ordered a lot of stuff from them, the orders always arrive correctly and in good time. I‚Äôm now subscribed to next day delivery and that has always been great too. I‚Äôve returned a lot of stuff and that‚Äôs never been an issue either. Always got my money, parcels never gone missing etc. Just keep your returns receipt just in case and they will still refund you the money. Couldn‚Äôt fault the company at all. I liked Asos a list when they had it also as I got a few vouchers out of it. I ordered something on next day delivery once and it didn‚Äôt turn up the next day, however I contacted them and they gave me my postage money back without bother! No issues. Would recommend."

Like most, I went to this website reading reviews about how poor of a job ASOS has done with terms of shipping and delivery. Unfortunately, I did not take these reviews seriously and ordered a dress expecting it to arrive on said due date. I hashed an extra $8 out for express delivery, for I needed the dress for a spring formal dance. Express delivery said the dress would be here in four days from the time I ordered it. It has been 7 days, and I JUST received an email saying my item's shipping label has been made. It hasn't even been shipped! The day that my item will actually be shipped is two days later from now, and there is no information for when it will arrive. Please take my word for it and DO NOT order from this website expecting delivery to be prompt. Give yourself at LEAST 3-4 weeks cushion for your parcels to arrive if ordering from here.-A very angry and broke high schooler"

They refused to provide  a tracking number and advised me that they had shipped without one.I now opened a dispute case with Paypal to get my refund because I had zero trust Asos would do the right thing...also they are waiting for the very last moment to reply to the Paypal Investigator or I'm guessing they will not reply at all...the only thing is they are intentional being ""doucheba*s"" and delaying the return of my money. Save yourself time and money and avoid these guys"
"March 02, 2019",1,Paid for next day delivery,"Paid for next day delivery, premier service, poor customer service, ignored my complaint when I emailed them, still no sign of order 6 days later and no explanation from ASOS.!"
"March 02, 2019",2,Crappy delivery system!,"I started buying from ASOS last year and I really liked their merchandise, so much that I signed up for one year of 2 day shipping for $19.99, which was an awesome price. Things went well for about 5 orders which were delivered in exactly 2 working days. I was a happy camper until my Feb 16, 2019 order. First I was told a delivery date of Feb 26, which is not 2 days. I asked and was told that the reason for the delay was that there has been a lot of businesses from the US. Not my fault! Then I get notified by Fedex of a delivery date of March 2. Two days later, it was changed to March 6, and the package has been shipped since Feb 26 from Georgia. What the heck!! Is Fedex taking the scenic route???? I enquired about this delay and was a given a generic answer, which means no help whatsoever! I don‚Äôt intend to buy anymore from ASOS."
"March 02, 2019",1,Same experiences as everyone else,"Same experiences as everyone else. No tracking info. Won't share why beyond a canned response that I kept getting, over and over, by ""EBONY"" on their chat. I was told there tracking info wasn't available due to the large volume in orders recently (makes absolutely no sense) and then when I asked ""How do you know then it's still on time if you haven't given me nor have a tracking number for this order?"" I was told ""There is no tracking number for this order I'm afraid. If you do not receive your order by the end of the day please get back in touch and we will get this looked into further for you."" As I continued to complain about the process and share how frustrated I was, the chat screen was silent...They have a few other options that are available for reaching out (and the chat is only available if you get it at the right time) which include FB messenger, tweeting, email, etc. I also sent them a FB message and am not having any movement on that end either.This isn't normal. My gut tells me they don't have a lot of these items or are about to go bankrupt/out of business and are trying to rake in the last bit of $$$  they can before they need to pay it back. I've already notified my bank that I may be contesting a charge."
"March 02, 2019",1,So I decided to look up reviews on ASOS‚Ä¶,"So I decided to look up reviews on ASOS as this is my first time shopping with them and it‚Äôs been a bit shady. I placed an order on Feb 17 and like most negative reviews here, I was told it should arrive on or before March 1st. Here it is March 2... no package, no tracking info. I sent an email to see what‚Äôs up and got a response that there was a delay and delivery is to be pushed back to the 5th. Ummm ya.. after reading some of these reviews I am loosing cofindence to say the least. I‚Äôve NEVER had such issues ordering online. This should not be happening on such a large scale and it‚Äôs quite sad. I typically don‚Äôt write reviews, but something needs to be done about this or ppl should be aware of what they are getting into when attempting to shop with this company. The positive reviews must be done by ASOS employers trying to do some damage control bc there are WAY too many similar complaints. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt place an enormous order with them bc I would be beyond furious. I kept my order minimal on purpose as a test run and let‚Äôs just say that I‚Äôm not impressed. Now, let‚Äôs see if I acually receive my coats and the shipping reimbursement as promised. It‚Äôs whatever if I don‚Äôt get the shipping reimbursement, but if I don‚Äôt receive my orders/they are messed up somehow and I have to take the time to fight w/them to get order or refund - I will loose it bc it‚Äôs not just about the money it‚Äôs about the principle. If you can‚Äôt handle the current volume of your business, its time to downsize to improve quality - period."

"March 02, 2019",1,Not what they used to be,"I‚Äôve been such a faithful customer and ASOS was always my first go to place whenever I wanted or needed something. HOWEVER, these last few years they have been TERRIBLE!!!!! Their customer service has been disgraceful, they have sent me wrong items, they even sent me an item that smelt of cigarettes!!!, they‚Äôve messed up my deliveries many times, I mean I could go on!"
"March 02, 2019",1,Be prepared to pay for any mistakes ASOS makes,"As a once faithful ASOS shopper I have witnessed how they have become crappier with each passing year. Years ago they used to have one of the best customer services, free shipping (on U.S. orders) with no minimum (it eventually moved up to a minimum of $25 which I think was still pretty reasonable and now it's at $50), and an awesome selection of decently priced clothes for the quality. This is no longer the case.Anyway, I made a purchase from them a couple of weeks ago. For my shipping option I chose Click & Collect (which means you can have them send your item to a UPS store and then you can go pick it up when it's delivered there). So I noticed that I never received a notification that my package was ready although it was a couple of days past the expected delivery date. I drove down to the UPS store and they said to come back later as they didn't seem to have much information as to where it was and that maybe the delivery truck would bring it to the store later. Later that day before heading out back to UPS I checked the tracking and it stated ""DELIVERY REJECTED, RETURNING TO SENDER"".  I was completely confused so I called UPS. They stated that ASOS shipped my package with UPS SurePost which does not allow packages to be collected from UPS store but has to be completed with the post office delivering to my home mailbox. Therefore, when my package was delivered to the UPS store it was rejected and returned without me even being notified. UPS told me there was nothing they could do about it and to get in contact with ASOS. I then contacted ASOS in attempt to figure out why they would give me the option of Click & Collect but then send my package with SurePost. They didn't give me an answer. They also stated that they couldn't return the package and that I would have to reorder (annoying since the item was now out of stock). I was a little upset but what really sent me over the edge was their response when I asked if they were also going to refund my shipping. They said they would refund my order but NOT the shipping. I told them that was unacceptable and why if it was their mistake am I not being refunded every single dollar I paid. They stated because the shipping had a tracking number and so it can‚Äôt be refunded. So what if it had a tracking number?! YOU incorrectly sent it through the wrong service so again, WHY am I the one being penalized for your mistake? This is the move that hit the final nail in the coffin for me‚Äî- they ended the chat lol. Top tier customer service right there. I told them I would never purchase from them again and I mean it. They lost a faithful customer over $5 they could have easily (and should have rightfully) refunded me."

I checked with a representative the other day who told me that they had several California warehouses that they could ship from so I shouldn't worry - it would arrive on time (I don't even know if this is true about the warehouses?). It STILL has not shipped and when I spoke with someone last night they told me not to ask until after the delivery date. -__-   Because by some miracle it could arrive and they just forgot to send a tracking number? I was planning on taking this with me to a music festival this weekend but I will need to find something else.  This is my first and last purchase with ASOS."

I ordered a gorgeous outfit that I was really excited to receive and after waiting until the suggested delivery date (which is fine, I didn't pay for shipping) I still had yet to receive my order. When I inquired, I received cut and paste responses and was told to wait another two weeks for my order to arrive.

I dropped my package off on January 4, 2019 and it is now about to be March and I STILL have not gotten a refund for the items I returned. I checked the tracking on my return and it says that it was received by them on January 9, so I don't understand why 1. I was not notified that they received it and 2. still have yet to see a refund almost 2 months later. When I contacted customer service I got very generic responses and they were not helpful at all.

I tracked the package on February 27th knowing I was leaving out of town soon and it showed it was in Atlanta, GA and that it was going to be delivered March 4th. I reached out to customer care with screenshots and explained my situation hoping for help and was met with generic responses. Their solution is to wait until after March 1st.

In order to be extra safe (so I thought), I decided to upgrade to 2 day shipping. As I was checking out I realized the ETA for my order was 2/26. HMMMM...definitely not 2 day shipping. Although bothered, I figured I'd rather pay extra for the ""2 day shipping""  and receive it 2/26 than take my chance with regular shipping. As the days passed I grew worried that my dress would not make it in time ESPECIALLY because I hadn't received any tracking information. I reached out to customer service, which was not the slightest bit of help. you will never receive a response from the same representative. Not only that, but they don't even read through your whole email and give faulty information. Anyway, I did not end up with tracking info until 2/23 (3 days before ETA.) It is now 2/28 and my package will not be arriving any time soon. Received an email today saying it will arrive on 3/7. LOL. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM ASOS IF YOU NEED SPEEDY SHIPPING."

"February 28, 2019",2,2 stars only,"2 stars only. The guys from ASOS would say why? What did we wrong?I already ordered a couple of things and it came on time, perfect :) . When i opened the parcel it was the right size and it was ironed and clean, good.BUT i ordered i couple of clothes and shoes ASOS brand. The design for the price is nice, but shoes are not comfy, and the jacket inside is the worst made i saw in my life.So, use Asos for ordering clothes but my suggestion is do never order ASOS brand clothes made in china with the cheapest materials you will regret it.Totally disappointed with your quality brand clothes guys. Personally i would increase your quality controls.Although I'll keep ordering other brands in your webpage."

I returned the items from my order using the included return label and same packaging, just as I have in the past. However this time, ASOS reported they never received it. Also, hidden in their terms and conditions on some deep portion of their website, says that they recommend you receive a shipping receipt for returns because you are responsible for your items until they receive them.  This is not listed anywhere readily available to the consumer, including the multiple confirmation email(s) or the step by step return instructions on the shipping label. I spoke with Hannah from customer service who literally told me there was nothing she can do. Now I am out $230 and have no clothing or anything to show for it. I will never be ordering from ASOS again and will no longer recommend them to friends and family."

Ever since they've changed to Skynet Express it's been beyond terrible customer service and delivery standards. Also quite cowardly that they don't allow you to post on their fb wall.... clearly they know the issue but too high on their cost cutting exercise. Not sure I'll be a returning customer this time!"

As soon as there is any issue which involves them investigating and putting right they become very unhelpful.  I ordered goods for next day delivery and the courier lied that they tried to deliver but that no one was in. I suspect they did this because they couldn't locate the doorway of the flat (being on top of shops). I contacted ASOS to ask them to give the courier directions but I was told they couldn't do that and that I should contact the couriers myself. I found this very unhelpful as I was not changing delivery address only giving extra directions. It's now the third day and the courier still has not showed up. I have been a very long standing customer but in the light of this I'm considering to stop buying from you.

The delivery address on my order was correct so contacted ASOS through their live chat as they seem to have no actual phone number. I spoke to Rosie who told me I would get an update email with what was going on. No email so get in contact with Paige who tells me that I had to wait until the end of the day and if still no parcel, to get back in contact and she would get in contact with DPD and they will deliver tomorrow. That would be fine if I hadn't already been in contact with someone previously who told me different, paid for specific delivery day and that DPD were actually delivering to the correct address."

They told me I need to prove that I've purchased those items and my bank statement.

Then I did some research and came here. I saw many negative reviews. But I decided to take a risk; I also saw a suit I really wanted for dirt cheap. I bought it Feb 16 2019 with $3 extra for shipping. Today is Feb 22 and it just arrived. The suit has exceeded my expectations. It fits me perfectly with no tailoring required.

The package was supposedly delivered and signed for by the person at said address so I decided to go and check for myself, SHOCK there was no package at any of the houses along that street.Barnaby at ASOS was extremely rude and showed no willingness to help either get the item sent to the correct address or issue a refund.Barnaby kept asking me to go and collect the parcel from the address it was delivered despite telling him/her 4 times that the item is nowhere to be seen at any address.I am now out of pocket and still no step closer to getting a resolution.I will no longer use ASOS and advise the many customers I know not too as well.I really hope you up your game and train your staff on how to speak to customers.Last but not least I was on live chat to Barnaby and he just closed the chat on me out of the blue after challenging him/her on the issue.I will present this issue with trading standards."

They're generally pretty good but I've recently started to have issues with delivery times. Twice I've paid for faster shipping and the items have failed to arrive.

This is an absolutely insane protocol! Customer service is trash as well.

When I reached out for a refund for shipping they said they couldn‚Äôt and so I asked for the order to be cancelled and they said they couldn‚Äôt. What a scam. So now I have to wait for it to arrive and then wait a month for a refund and still pay expedited shipping
"February 21, 2019",1,Horrible return process,Horrible return process. Ordered a jacket which did not fit properly.First of all they don't offer an exchange only a refund and then you have to order again. Which is not a great service but would be OK if the refund would happen in a timely manner..

I buy from Asos a lot! I'm outside of the UK but I've never had any issues with delivery. In fact, they keep you updated for the whole delivery process and you can track online. I find their clothes true to size (for me anyway) and the quality is good value for money. I also love that they have such variety and great for plus size too."
"February 20, 2019",4,Good quality products and easy returns!,"To be honest I'm very surprised with all the bad reviews. I don't know about the express delivery because i'm using only the normal delivery and so far didn't have any issues. I'm shopping online many years now and I can surely say that I found ASOS to be one of the ""good"" companies selling good quality products. You can find expensive AND normal items. They have a variety of clothes. Also the return is very easy and FREE."
"February 20, 2019",5,Favorite store online,"I love love love ASOS! The items are good quality, the shipping is fast (takes about a week to get to Lithuania). Also, their return policy has been so great and helpful. It's very easy to send back items that didn't fit and get a full refund."

Aside from ‚Äú2-day‚Äù turning out to be 2 WEEKS, the live chat support was the most disrespectful experience I‚Äôve ever had with customer care in my life. After being a loyal customer of theirs for years, I thought I‚Äôd return to a smooth transaction process after a year hiatus. But it seems things have changed. Sad situation."

"February 20, 2019",1,ASOS is no longer a site I will be purchasing from,"ASOS is no longer a site I will be purchasing from, from the horrible quality of clothes that have only dwindled even further to the lack of customer service.

To date 2/19/2019 I‚Äôve yet to receive my refund.  I chatted with the USELESS reps who are incomprehensible; one told me to wait until the 19th.  On the 19th I chatted with another rep; I was told it‚Äôs not the end of business day.  At 7:45 pm I chatted again, and this rep was the worse.  I have screen shots where she told me ‚ÄúI told you not to write in; to wait till the end of business day ; stop writing me‚Äù.  So I asked this chick; when is the end of business day , cuz that‚Äôs pratcially the 20th. And on the 20th will I be told to write in at the end of business day too. If ASOS wants to sell in America, have a call center set up with Americans to help us. Clearly this chat thing isn‚Äôt working."
"February 19, 2019",1,Labels cut out and clothes already worn and stink,"Ordered a pretty expensive coat and a pair of jeans. The jeans were, no joke, about 4 sizes too small and all of the tags and labels had been cut out.

"February 19, 2019",1,Worst Online Purchasing Experience I Have Ever Encountered,"Ordered 3 dresses yesterday and selected next day delivery for today.Got an email at 4am today saying one of the dresses is out of stock and I'll be refunded which I didn't actually see given the send time - first disappointment. They say they hold your items but sell them elsewhere.Anyway, my partner waited in between the hour delivery slot they gave us - no items came and I got a text to say they attempted delivery but no one answered. Ended up having to call DPD who said they hadn't actually received the order from ASOS so no idea why I was given tracking info - waste of my partners time. I was told to contact ASOS directly. While on live chat with ASOS, I received another email from DPD saying they did have it, but the driver went to the wrong address. Good job the incorrect address tenants weren't in or theyd have had my dresses for free - though they do now have the calling card and potentially my personal information. ASOS customer services were largely unhelpful, offered no real apology, and their best solution was to have it redelivered on a day not to my convenience. They offered delivery between now (Tues) and next Thursday. I asked for Sunday as it is the only day I'll be home. Then told it wasn't possible to guarantee Sunday delivery. I asked them to deliver to my partners work - not possible for them. Now I have to go and pick it up myself from a local depot.Honestly the worst online purchasing experience I've had in years, and after all that hassle, I saw the email saying the nicest of the three dresses is out of stock anyway and wont be delivered."

"February 19, 2019",1,They blame you.,"I paid for 2 days shipping in order to have a dress for an event this upcoming weekend. I ordered on the 17th thinking that would give me plenty of time to get the dress and make sure everything was in order. Then came today, the 19th, when the dress should've arrived and lo-and-behold ASOS says it'll be here the 26th, instead. They told me I should've known as it showed as estimated delivery and would not refund me for the extra cost of 2 day shipping. That is was simply my fault, and not theirs for offering a quicker option and not making good on it."
"February 19, 2019",1,I really want to give zero starts but‚Ä¶,"I really want to give zero starts but that option is unavailable, so I guess one will have to do. I was charged $8 for 2-day shipping. But now my shipment tracking says that my order won‚Äôt arrive for over a week. It explicitly stated at the checkout that it was going to be TWO-DAY shipping. Then I wrote to the customer service team to try and remedy the situation. Not only was Molly‚Äîmy customer service rep‚Äîridiculously unhelpful, but she was also rude and ended the chat before we were done speaking. This company just lost one customer and I would advise any and all shoppers to watch out for little tricks they play when charging you for services that go completely unrendered."
"February 19, 2019",1,I agree with several comments about‚Ä¶,"I paid for two day shipping and despite contacting them several times , they shipped late ! Fortunately my son didn‚Äôt need the suit right away, but their customer service is absolutely terrible! Now for the good stuff: suit arrived nicely packaged and the suit itself is super sharp!  My son is a soccer player and at 6‚Äô2‚Äù and super handsome he could wear a trash bag and still look good, however the suit we got is of very nice quality and looks like tailored made."
"February 19, 2019",1,I would give them a 0 if i could,"TERRIBLE. I have shopped here before and had very mediocre customer service experience. After I had not received my packaged passed the delivery date they just told me they can't really do anything and to just wait!! This time their system glitched and during checkout increased the quantity of an item in my bag after I refreshed it. I saw it after an hour and they told me they can't do anything and if I want to return it I have to pay a fee of $22.40. Are you kidding me? This is fraud.UPDATE: its been well past my order's expected delivery date and my order still isnt here. They have no clue where it is and asked me to wait 20 MORE DAYS and then contact them then!! WOW Also every time you connect with a representative to chat, they totally ignore you for at least 5 minutes and they try to finish the chat ASAP without being helpful at all. THE ABSOLUTE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE RECEIVED."
"February 18, 2019",1,Horrible customer service,"Horrible customer service - pay to have two day shipping and each time I order something it never arrives in two days sometimes it takes more than a week. Each time I reach out to state so, customer service is so rude and sometimes even disconnects the chat so they don‚Äôt have to deal. They give you the run around and just state they are not responsible for late shipping - ummm then who is?!! Won‚Äôt give any sort of compensation no matter how good a customer you are, totally ridiculous I‚Äôm really not sure how they are still in business, thank god most of their stuff is cheap"

Asos have never let me down and they're my 'go to' site for clothing.The video of every item helps me decide and the description of the clothes is amazing!
"February 18, 2019",1,Placed my order,"Placed my order, the clothes never arrived. Was a big hassle with DHL who ""lost"" the package. Asked for a refund and tried contacting their customer support multiple times, they never responded. And later on they had the audacity to ask me to Review their customer support: horrible.Also never got a refund, not even a new set of clothes."
"February 18, 2019",1,Bad service,"Really disappointed with your service. I purchased with you three times and every time I did it, I got wrong delivery. First time instead of dress that I payed around 25¬£ I got a black shirt really bad quality that looks like it costs 5¬£ (not even). Then second time I ordered Adidas dress size M, and I got size S. And last and final time I ordered really light purple shirt and I got dark purple shirt totaly different then what I ordered. There is obviously a reason why we can do online shopping. I don't want to spend my time in shops and even more I don't want to spend my time on returning the wrong items you send me. Thanks a lot."
"February 18, 2019",1,Order returned before delivery,"I placed a very large order before my holidays, paying for next day delivery. The order did not leave DPD depot (ASOS's courier). DPD claimed that ASOS requested that the order be returned. ASOS claimed that they did not. The full order will now take up to 15 working days to refund. ASOS could not explain what had happened, offered no apologies and did not have a formal complaints procedure."
"February 17, 2019",1,Never have a come across a company with,"Never have a come across a company with terrible customer service. They have no values, code of conduct, morals, etc. If they were audited I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the auditors found fraud just at at a quick glance of their financial statements. Poor poor company. It really sucks because they could have so much more potential."
"February 16, 2019",3,Lacking in customer service and issues with the website,"Never really had any major issues with ASOS until recently.  I placed an order, which arrived in good time.  I had an issue and I wanted to ask a question.  I tried contacting them using the 'need help' link after logging in - but the option to 'Chat Now' or 'Send an email' don't appear to work.  For example if you try to 'Chat Now' you're then given the option to sign in (even though you're already signed in).  And when you try to sign in you're taken back to the same page you started with."
"February 16, 2019",1,Rude and negative staff,"Absolutely rude staff and inside the warehouse people don‚Äôt know how to speak to you with manors. I do not recommend anyone to work in this negative environment. People who work in the office are really negative and treat you like your an animal, they do not have respect for you and whenever you take a day off they will always try and make a problem out of it. I highly do not recommend anyone to work in this unprofessional, rude and negative warehouse."
"February 16, 2019",1,People that work in the office are rude‚Ä¶,People that work in the office are rude as hell and They shout at people for some petty things and treat you like an animal. It‚Äôs okay for them to be absent but for you it‚Äôs not. Disgusting behaviour Negative environment I highly don‚Äôt recommend anyone to work in this disgusting environment.
"February 16, 2019",1,I contacted ASOS CC to and was given‚Ä¶,I contacted ASOS CC to and was given advice that a product I planned on returning would be refunded to the credit card I had on my account. After returning the product I didn't receive a refund & contacted ASOS to investigate. ASOS have been giving me the run around ever since. There is no option to lodge a complaint either.
"February 16, 2019",1,"Terrible customer service, feel cheated","Terrible customer service. My order was expected to come no later than Dec 6th 2018, but it never came. I sent ASOS emails, proof of no receivement, then they asked me to wait 30 days. After 30 days they said they would send a refund and within 10 working days it would be in my bank account.Guess what happened? This is Feb 16th, 2019 and still NO REFUND. I send them emails and bank statement as they requested.They still not give any refund Is it a fraud business?????"
"February 15, 2019",2,disappointed,"very disappointed about the Standard Delivery service. Products were supposed to arrive the 23/01 and by the beginning of February I wrote the customer service, I was told that I will be refund as the products I've ordered were out of stock so a replacement was impossible :( Instead, the customer service is nice"
"February 15, 2019",3,"Fantastic and cheap clothing, bad customer service","Good quality for a cheap price and great selection! But the customer service is bad, took multiple emails and chats to get the money back for a mixed up order (mistake was made on their end)"
"February 15, 2019",1,Poor customer service,Just trying to renew premier delivery. Payment has been taken but it has not been activated on my account. They all seem to be unable to sort it out yet they have my money and don‚Äôt seem to have any answers. Even if I want a refund it will take 5-10 days to get my money back before I can try to put premier delivery on my account again
"February 15, 2019",1,Dont waist your money on Premium‚Ä¶,Dont waist your money on Premium delivery!!!!I have premium delivery and ordered something that should have been delivered today! after reaching out to ASOS thru a chat apt they have (because you cant talk to anyone) they informed me that my package wont be delivered for 4 more days and they offered me 15%off my next full price purchase...... Now does that seem like a fair tradeoff and all they can say (thru text) is sorry. This is bad way to do business for sure. I am very disapointed in how they handle there screw ups.
"February 15, 2019",5,Used ASOS for the last 2 years using‚Ä¶,Used ASOS for the last 2 years using premier delivery with DPD. Next day deliveries always recieved on time. Easy returns and prompt refunds. Never had cause to complain.
"February 15, 2019",1,Never delivered!!,"My parcel is sitting somewhere and I have no way of knowing if it‚Äôs ever going to be delivered. I no longer want the item but ASOS refuse to refund me as the parcel is still with the courier Hermes (where it‚Äôs been for approx 3 WEEKS! ) Customer service says they have no way of communicating with Hermes, they are rude and completely hopeless And ended the chat because they couldn‚Äôt be bothered to answer my questions....... Never again!!"
"February 15, 2019",5,Will always shop with asos!,Never had an issue with Asos. Been shopping with them for over 5years now. Always delivered on or before the delivery date. Returns are free and easy and within 2 weeks I have my refund. This week I received a parcel and one of the earrings were missing from the packet I had purchased so I contacted Asos who immediately rectified the issue by sending a replacement free of charge and only asked me to despose of the spare earring in the most environmentally friendly way possible or keep as a spare. So many different brands and styles to choose from. I love asos and would highly recommend the shopping brand.
"February 15, 2019",1,All clothes and shoes is from‚Ä¶,"All clothes and shoes is from China,that's the reason why everythink is too small,I ordered shoes size 7 but get as size 5,same with dresses.Very dissapointed..."
"February 14, 2019",1,DO NOT USE,"DO NOT USE - Ordered same day delivery twice through asos, never recieved my parcel both times.  If you live in London DO NOT use.  Waste of money. Finally got my refund a month later. They say they have attempted delivery but I was in the whole time and they did not once attempt delivery. I've told Asos about this and after telling me it was delivered after me arguing they accepted it wasn't. Customer service is appalling."
"February 14, 2019",1,Should have checked Trustpilot first,"Should have checked here first. First order with Asos and yes, the order was cancelled 2 days later. Waste of time."
"February 14, 2019",1,Never receive the right product,Never receive the right product. Either the wrong size or completely wrong item. Pay for next day delivery and end up sending back anyway. Wouldn‚Äôt buy from ASOS again as have had one too many bad experiences with them now.
"February 14, 2019",1,Ordered some clothing for my wife,"Ordered some clothing for my wife, paid for next day delivery and it turned up wrong on there behalf, I called up customer service and they said it was a mix up there end and said I needed to return my order in full with no refund on the delivery and refused to send the correct items out free of charge. Will definitely not be buying again"
"February 14, 2019",2,Cut off Live Chat,"I placed an order with ASOS today an hour ago and had forgotten to amend my delivery address. I logged onto live chat to be told that as I wasn‚Äôt within the 15 minute grace period I couldn‚Äôt cancel and re-order or change my delivery address!! Expected to believe that the order has already been packed and sent for delivery?! Yeah right! I spoke with Laura on LiveChat who then told me as she had already explained I cannot do anything, she was ending the chat!!! Really bad customer service to just cut off someone on Live Chat - and ridiculous that an hour after ordering I cannot make amendments or cancel!"
"February 13, 2019",5,I absolutely love ASOS,"I absolutely love ASOS, this is literally my number 1 go to place now. I love how you have so much variety from different brands (wish there was a children‚Äôs section though) love next day delivery! Love how the models are videod wearing the clothes on a cat walk. Don‚Äôt like the models dancing in the clothes videos, prefer the walk 100 percent which most of the videos are. Love love love!"
"February 13, 2019",5,Love this company,"Love this company, not only because of products, easy pickup or return procedures - but love it because of quick customer service. Just pop them an email and they will reply with an answer straight away."
"February 13, 2019",1,AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS!! They cancelled my order and themselves don't know why!,"I desperately needed some trainers as a gift to be delivered today (13th Feb). I paid for next day delivery to guarantee this.I received an SMS at 7am saying my order couldn't be delivered today and to contact ASOS. I contacted ASOS and they initiated a 'return to sender' request at 1am. They said my order will be returned to them and I'll be given a refund.I have never had a company sell me a product with guaranteed next day delivery and then stop my order from reaching me at 1am, I'm simply lost for words.I've now got no present to give to a loved one and have purchased the same item from a competitor of ASOS who have guaranteed me next day delivery. ASOS asked me to order from them again but if they don't know why they cancelled my order as it was being delivered last time then it is likely to happen again.I was a brand new customer who had never purchased from ASOS before, this was the first transaction and the start of our relationship. I would give them 0 stars if possible. I wish I had checked their review ratings - they are rated terrible for a reason, please do yourself a favour and buy from a more caring and organised company.I wanted to make a formal complaint, I was told that I had to do it using their website which is more for troubleshooting. After much hassle I wrote a complaint.The person completely ignored all of my written text and treated me as though I was a happy customer checking on their order - very poor.The response I received is below:Thanks for contacting us at ASOS. Sorry to hear you didn't receive your order 388914318 and it's being returned to us.I've checked your order for you and it's on its way back to our warehouse due to you explaining you wouldn't need this order unless it arrived at a certain point.We're unable to resend your order to you. As soon as we've received the parcel, we'll refund the cost of the items and send you an email to let you know.Please allow 7 working days for your parcel to arrive at our warehouse and be processed. We'll drop you an email when it‚Äôs been done. It may take 5-10 working days for funds to show in your account.If you haven't received a returns confirmation email by the 22nd of February let us know and we can look into this for you.I'm really sorry your order didn't reach you. If you still want the items and they're still available, please order them through our website as normal as I'm unable to place your order for you, for security reasons. An easy way to do this is to log into your account, view the original order and then add the items you want back into your shopping bag.We make every effort to ensure that you receive your orders on time and are happy with our service.

Today 13 February they giving me the run around again telling me to wait till 4th March!!!!I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!"
"February 13, 2019",1,When I ordered product return was free,"When I ordered product return was free, but when I needed to return the product, they had changed the terms and charged money for return. DO NOT USE ASOS!"

"February 12, 2019",1,Absolutely shocking service at ASOS,"Absolutely shocking service at ASOS. I bought a parcel from ASOS paid next day delivery, only to receive my item 4 days late. I opened the parcel and the item is completely wrong. I tried to complain through ASOS yet, customer service could not answer any of my questions. Absolute joke of a company. NEVER USE IT!!"
"February 12, 2019",5,Favourite,"Regularly shop with ASOS and have only ever had good experiences. Reliable delivery, good range of products/brands and a really simple, easy to use free returns policy. Would always recommend. Only downside is the end of the A-Lister rewards programme which was great"
"February 12, 2019",1,Absolutly never shopping here again due‚Ä¶,Absolutly never shopping here again due to a techincal fault wasnt able to update my new addresses and asos unwilling to do anything sbout this pure shambles of customer services
"February 12, 2019",1,UK medium is an ASOS size 6.,Ordered a UK medium. They sent me a size 6. River island website states UK 10-12.Now I have to return the item to them. Wait for my refund because they are sized different. It's ridiculous.Their return policy is rigid even if they agree it's their mistake.Its not a customer care service. They don't give 2 hoots. I wont be ordering again.
"February 12, 2019",1,Absolutely terrible customer service,"I sent back 2 items worth ¬£200 and didn't receive a refund for a month! The representatives were rude and took a long time to help me out, that was until I informed them I still have a receipt from the post office. That's when they immediately decided to put me onto their specialist team to receive an email in 24 hours.... and about 12 hours later my refund was confirmed, meaning that they likely received the delivery more than 2 weeks prior to this and decided to not give any refund until I reminded them. One of the worst customer service that I have come across on an e-commerce."
"February 12, 2019",2,I feel cheated!,"I feel cheated! Instead of the classy cut lace dress pictured on their site that I ordered for a wedding in a few weeks, I received a cheap  blue lace dress (like lace curtains) that is OBVIOUSLY not what was pictured.The customer service agent I spoke with couldn't ensure I would be sent the correct item if I ordered again. The dresses are made by the same company, Chi Chi London, but are very different. I feel like I was sent an inferior product on purpose. Customer service was poor as well. Don't think I'll try for the correct dress."
"February 11, 2019",1,Somone really needs to check out ASOS‚Ä¶,"Somone really needs to check out ASOS and their undelivered items policy. The item does not belong to me until it is delivered yet i am being told to wait weeks to allow the courier to find something before they will think about refunding anything. How can this be logical? I bought something, they failed to deliver, yet i have to wait. If you have a car accident your insurance pays for it and then chases the other car for money, if the courier loses an item it should be the same. The customer should not be made to pay. Allowing Hermes 2 weeks to find an item is an agreement ASOS have with Hermes, not me, and they did not state this anywhere on their website. Yes of course allow a delivery company one or 2 days extra, but 2 weeks? And then i have to start the process again. And then they can take weeks to issue an refund......sad thing is, if they had just refunded i would have re-ordered. Or they could have just resent the item.....but they are effectively treating me as though i am the one in the wrong....i hope they crash! (ASOS, not the courier)"
"February 11, 2019",5,I've been a customer of Asos for years,"I've been a customer of Asos for years! I've never experience an issue with this company and have just realised how brilliant they are. They are very easy to deal with and honestly I've never had to contact them regarding an issue of an order because there hasn't been any. But all the orders that have been placed through them, I've always received the order on time, and anything I don't like they offer a free return service which is really easy. The quality of ASOS clothes is great, and so is the Klarna service that they are using which lets us pay later."
"February 11, 2019",5,I have just great experience with Asos,"I have just great experience with Asos! Have ordered from them many times, 2 times returned items as they didnt fit well, but thats how it is when you shop online. This time I returned 2 packages, 1 seemed lost, wrote about it in chat and in a few minutes got a heads up email that they have received the second package and it is being processed! I think that is a good service and will continue buying from Asos. So I dont agree that ‚Äònone reads emails‚Äô as others say."
"February 11, 2019",1,Delivery was lost by DPD and are‚Ä¶,"Delivery was lost by DPD and are currently conducting a search. ASOS are unable to refund the amount until the parcel has been found. No consideration into the inconvenience it has caused there customer , in addition of the fact I no longer need or have use for the items of clothing and accessories as they failed to reach me on the day it was required, after saying this they stil refused to give me a refund and continue to delay. Whats the point in finding the parcel and then refunding me, i wont be getting any of those items i have no interest in the parcel but only the money iv spent that i should lawfully recieve without having to wait for a search that is of no benefit to me."
"February 11, 2019",1,I dread buying anything from ASOS,"I dread buying anything from ASOS these days. Been shopping with them for over 11 years and for last year at least the customer service is so poor. Rude CS team  - they should learn from Newlook's CS team, best cs support you will find these days."
"February 11, 2019",1,Failed delivery. No refund after 2 months.,Like many people that have left reviews on here I have spent months dealing with ASOS's semi-automated customer service to no avail. I ordered an item for ¬£150 through instant delivery. Item never arrived despite me waiting in and numerous attempts to deliver it. I asked for the delivery to be cancelled and a refund. 2 months later - no refund. Every time I speak to customer service I get the same template response. Told that my query will be passed onto the specialist team and to wait for an email. Apparently the item needs to reach ASOS's warehouse from the courier CitySprint in order for them to issue the refund. This is ridiculous. I should not have to pay for the failings of ASOS's courier service. I will not be using ASOS again after years as a customer and I shall be telling everyone to avoid.
"February 11, 2019",1,Customer Service is basically a template email response!,"After placing my order and paying almost GBP 20 for express international service I received an email from the courier company with the tracking number except the tracking number lead me to a page that states that my package was delivered in July 2018. I contacted customer service who stated that as per the courier there is no record of my shipment but as per Asos I should receive my order by the 14th of Feb.  I am not sure why or how the customer service representative thought that his email would in anyway comfort me or resolve my issue if he stated that the courier has no record of my shipment. I continued to correspond with customer service and every time a different person replied but using the same template email stating that if I do not get my package on Feb 14th then to get in touch. I tried explaining that I would no longer need the package after that date and that the reason I paid for express shipping for an item that cost the same as the shipping is because I needed it urgently. The response I received was mind blowing they stated "" if you no longer need the item after late arrival then you can return it"".  Again I am not sure how that was the solution when all I needed were the correct tracking details and to be sure that my package existed and was shipped. Instead of copying and pasting emails maybe someone from customer service could have picked up the phone and called the courier company who ""had no record of my order""! in the end  I did actually receive my order today 11 February, so I guess Asos and their courier service have no clue what they are sending out and when.."
"February 10, 2019",5,Ordered from asos twice,"Ordered from asos twice, at the moment everything was and is fine. I live in Latvia, so if anyone is wondering where i am from... Both orders were +7 items and i paid for next-day-delivery and both packages were in Latvia after 2 days, got them on my hands on third day. I am happy with sizes and quality of clothes. Oder tracking system was working good. So yeah, for sure gonna buy more stuff from asos in future."
"February 10, 2019",1,Would like to give 0 stars,Would like to give 0 stars. Customer service is a joke. Can‚Äôt redeem a gift card and raised the issue with customer service - 20 days later still no response and just kept being told to wait for a response.Can‚Äôt even complaint.
"February 09, 2019",1,"Not trustworthy or friendly, why bother?","I placed an order on the US site and received an email that the items would arrive February 6. I gave it until the 9th, but still nothing has arrived. I chatted with an ASOS customer service rep who provided tracking showing delivery on February 13, a whole week later. They have good prices and items I like, but I won't be returning to a business that can't follow through on their own word. If the email simply stated it'd take that long, then I would have had another gift lined up instead of waiting on them and now having to do something else last minute. The customer service representative wasn't even friendly, so I am done with this store."
"February 09, 2019",1,Just the living worst,"Terrible customer service, refuse to accept accountability for deliveries showing up. Paid for next day delivery (expected item to be delivered Tuesday), for DPD to lie about attempting delivery TWICE (I was at home after taking 2 days off work to make sure I didn‚Äôt miss this). After hours of emailing ASOS and DPD to get this rectified, I was told by ASOS that they had attempted delivery twice, and sorry I had missed it. Beyond infuriating when you are trying to raise a complaint and explain their couriers‚Äô misconduct, however their policy is apparently to blame the customer. Never ordering with them again. Also, still not received my delivery, and told by DPD that I will have to collect it now on Monday, due to them having technical issues. Absolute shambles of organisations."
"February 09, 2019",1,Extremely poor,"Extremely poor, so disappointed I was ASOS customers for years but they become so bad lately. I have bought ¬£300 worth of gifts and the delivery man have never turned up, ASOS told me it was sent back as confirmed to ASOS form DHL and I have to wait for 2 weeks for my money. now I have no money to buy gifts for my family before I travel and I have no gifts. the online chat girls ""LAURA"" chat ref. 17924399- could and would NOT do anything to help, could not speak to a manager who might have more power, could not raise a complaint and I was not even allowed to get my prime service fees which are only ¬£9,99 refunded. in the end, she closed chat on me. WOOOOW. DO NOT use ASOS, switch to Chi Chi or Very.com. Not only receiving such an awful service but the way they treat you as a loyal customer who spent ¬£¬£¬£¬£ in the past few years is disgusting. DON'T USE ASOS."
"February 09, 2019",1,This company took my money the moment I‚Ä¶,"This company took my money the moment I placed my on line order, 10 days on, after phone calls and emails, we have no goods and no refund, the customer service team me told us they had no record of our order, but would refund when I could prove that they had taken my money.  I sent them my bank statement showing the charge but still no refund or goods.  I have now written to their CEO Mr Nick Beighton to see if I can get some answers.  If I had read the on line reviews about this company I would never have bought from them in the first place.  Lesson learnt always look at the customer reviews before you hand over your money to people like this."
"February 09, 2019",1,Very poor customer service and technical problems,"I have used ASOS for years but have finally decided it is more hassle than it‚Äôs worth after two really poor experiences. Twice now I have been charged for orders that didn‚Äôt go through due to technical glitches on the website. This has resulted in my money being waiting to be refunded, which on one occasion took a number of weeks. I had great difficulty getting help from customer services and it took many calls and a lot of time to resolve. In the end it was paypal that was more helpful. I would not recommend ASOS."
"February 09, 2019",1,very poor service quality...I'm talking‚Ä¶,"very poor service quality...I'm talking all day about a delayed delivery!They have lied to me about 3 times that my order will be delivered to me by end of 08/02, make me remained all day at home...not giving me the chance for a plan B...they insisted that have to wait till 00:01 in order to claim that my ordered is delayed...and now they informed me that i have to wait till 19/02...they do not care at all for customers..."
"February 08, 2019",5,surprised by all the negative reviews,I'm very surprised by all the negative reviews as I have shopped a lot with ASOS and never had a problem/problem not resolved. I've had every refund processed properly. I received one incorrect item and they sorted it immediately. I received a parcel so badly damaged not all the items were in it and they rectified that immediately (they sent a cardboard box instead of their plastic bags - ASOS stick with the bags please!). They are often more expensive than other places but I think you are paying for the customer service and free delivery and quality of how they advertise their products (videos). I only don't shop with them now since their rewards scheme ended and I suspect they have lost other people's business because of this as it looks lately like their profits had taken a down turn. Bring back the points scheme/rewards scheme ASOS!
"February 08, 2019",1,ASOS are a disgrace! Worst customer service ever!,"NEVER SHOP WITH ASOS!! They have the most disgusting customer service ever, they don't care about their customers and service levels mean nothing to them. Take your money elsewhere, seriously."
"February 08, 2019",1,disgraceful customer service.,Absolutely awful customer service at asos. They have no interest in helping you resolve the issue. I‚Äôve done two live chat with two different people who both ended the chat before resolving the issue or giving me a chance to respond to what they sent back. Devinia the first person didn‚Äôt help at all and clearly couldn‚Äôt be bothered. Kirsten the second person attempted too but then just gave up and closed the chat. The issue I have is still unresolved and I‚Äôm still waiting for a response. Honestly don‚Äôt waste your time with this company. Go else where to other companies that appreciate your loyalty and are actually willing to help you. I know understand why there‚Äôs so many negative reviews and totally agree with them!

"February 07, 2019",1,Asos have the worst customer services‚Ä¶,"Asos have the worst customer services I've ever dealt with. The agents are unable to answer basic questions and just copy/paste the same generic responses to emails - most of the time it doesn't even read as though they've actually read the email properly. Still waiting for a refund of ¬£160 for 2 items that weren't delivered on an order in DECEMBER. Have sent them around 10 emails in total over the past 1.5 months trying to resolve it - finally got to the point of them saying they would refund, now waiting over a week for the refund. Asked today for the transaction reference or some details but they are unable to provide anything. Have used Asos almost exclusively for online clothes shopping for well over 5 years, recommended them to many people, but will obviously no longer dos so. You really find out a lot about a company when something goes wrong and how they deal with it. The customer service agents either don't care or are just bad at their jobs."

I had a voucher which was given to me as a present. however I ordered something and returned it now they are saying its expired based on the original purchase date! how does that even work!  customer service were completely unhelp and rude! basically just sold my money!!!
"February 06, 2019",1,Horrible service,"Horrible service! Wrong item send twice, I payed return postages! Don‚Äôt order!"
"February 06, 2019",5,This is an amazing place to get the‚Ä¶,"This is an amazing place to get the perfect dress! The Item came on the exact day it said it would! I didnt get my email for the tracking number,  so I got a bit worried, I needed my dress to make pics on time for my engagement! So I started reading comments and so many  were negative saying that it's a scam, nothing at all, my dress is in better condition then I thought! It fits perfect,  plus so comfortable! I would definitely shop with ASOS again!"
"February 06, 2019",1,Do not order with ASOS - better retailers out there!!,"Terrible terrible service.My order was obviously not delivered as Hermes are terrible and lost it.  I received confirmation from Hermes that it has been lost and sent this to ASOS as advised by Hermes.  ASOS told me they were unable to contact Hermes, even via their email service as it is not a ‚Äòbusiness line‚Äô and have said they are not able to contact their contracted courier at all.  Furthermore, they refuse to refund my money or send a replacement until 2 weeks have passed since the order was placed - so are effectively withholding money.I have reported this to further to the Retail ADR - I see online this has become a common problem with ASOS and believe they need to be investigated."
"February 06, 2019",2,Will never order again.,"I had a good experience before, until 4 weeks ago when I did not see my 2 parcels arriving, and wanted to get more information on the matter on the online chat, the customer care of one of them was disgusting. He was showing me how much I bored him and That he did not have time for me. But I was happy when a few days ago the customer care of asos messenger helped me to get my money back. However today when I wanted to order back my stuff I saw that asos shipping fee jumped for 4usd to 31.68 usd. And free shipping from 31.68 to 315 usd. Honestly I live in a small country where the salary is not that great and if the shipping price are jumping that high I prefer to look for another online clothing site, as for us its quite expensive. And when my friends and relatives got to know about it their reaction was the same. I don't think I will ever buy there again."
"February 06, 2019",1,Worst company no customer service at‚Ä¶,Worst company no customer service at all sent out wrong size no apology at customer service appaulling company stay away from them they posted out the wrong size small instead of medium horrendous service truely horrendous then had to travel 18 miles to send it back no apology or anything at all my advise is do not purchase from them at all
"February 06, 2019",1,Incredibly cocky and unhelpful customer service team.,"This company is terrible. I ordered a parcel and paid next day delivery, it did not turn up for 3 days so I changed it to go to a local parcel shop, it then could not be delivered due to a unforeseen problem. I was then told it had been rejected and was 'on it's way back to the ASOS warehouse' only to find that I had been lied to and this was never the case - it had been sat in that shop for 2 weeks and I hadn't received my refund. When I asked them what was going on they said that I had to go and collect it and sort it out despite them telling me it had all been sorted previously. Absolutely ridiculous! They were basically asking ME to do their job for them. I also received NO apology."
"February 06, 2019",5,Absolutely brilliant company!,"Absolutely brilliant company. If I ever have any issues, big or small, they are taken seriously and acted upon promptly. They have a lifetime customer in myself, and I recommend them to anybody looking for a reliable company to purchase clothing and accessories from!"
"February 06, 2019",1,Got to pay $230 for an import fee,Got to pay $230 for an import fee. Then more paperwork required. How anout stating that up front because not only do you pay more for spening over $800 but you also dont get two day shipping
"February 05, 2019",1,Legal Thieves ( Reviews don‚Äôt lie!! ),I was in the ASOS customer service chat I spoke to a Charlie and Dani and they where not helpful at all . I explained the situation and the right thing to do would be to help but she dismissed what I said. Disappointed never ordering from there again. They only care to take your money and then proceed to not in return provide quality service. In other words they‚Äôre scammers .
"February 05, 2019",1,Atroscious customer service skills,"Atroscious customer service skills (or lack of) from most the team in the customer care department (namely Kamran- no customer service whatsoever). ASOS as a brand is going downhill and I can now see why. They‚Äôre more interested in sending automated responses as opposed to actually understand customer issues and properly looking into them. Changing their couriers as well resulting in a number if delays, even though you chose and pay for next day delivery, and then their staff have the audacity to say wait till midnight to see if the item gets delivered? Sorry, what?Extremely disappointed asos customer for over 5 years. Fair to say, I‚Äôll be slowly stopping using the website. Drastic changes required to their business model if they wish to stand any chance of competing in the market."
"February 05, 2019",5,Don't listen to the other reviews!! Asos is great!,"I don't understand the other reviews as I've never had a bad experience whilst shopping with Asos.com! I do a lot of shopping on this site and have subscribed to the unlimited next day delivery for ¬£9.99 and my parcels are always on delivered on time. When I have received a package that has been faulty (has only happened once or twice), I contacted them on Twitter via DM and they responded within the hour and the problem was immediately rectified. I would definitely recommend Asos to my friends and I think that the Next Day Delivery package is well worth it!! :)"
"February 05, 2019",1,"Honestly, the worst ever customer service.","Honestly, the worst. I didn't get a returns slip and when I enquired as to when they would send me a new one they took great pleasure in telling me that they didn't do that, then they told me to go to a local library or a family members house to use the printer. NOT THE POINT. The point is, you, the retailer, screwed up. Take responsibility for that and stop asking your already inconvenienced customers to be further inconvenienced. When I tried to get them to take responsibility, the person left the chat."
"February 05, 2019",1,Horrible customer service,"Horrible customer serviceIf they send the wrong item to you and want a refund you have to wait a month before you get your money back. First you have to pick it up for a warehouse, resend the item which can take a week or more then this ‚ÄúIt can take up to 14 working days to arrive back at our warehouse‚Äù ‚Äúfunds will show in your account within 5-10 working days of the refund being completed.‚Äù 100% their mistake but offer nothing in return.From what I have read this is not uncommon."
"February 05, 2019",1,"...PLEASE PEOPLE: DON'T BUY FROM ASOS, THEY ARE SCAMMERS,","I've just figured out the Asos scam.If you read a lot of the negative ( and a few of the positive ) reviews, it's a common occurrence that us buyers will either be sent the wrong size, or the wrong order.Meanwhile, the department they laughingly call ""customer service"", advise that stocks are low of the item you require, and that if you still want the item, you really ought to order now, whilst stocks last.So you return the order, and order another size or item. At this point the buyer has no goods, but Asos has 2 payments, so who's on top at this point?If foolishly, like me, you order a third time ( and of course, you're GUARANTEED not to get the correct order again ) and they send the wrong item again ( incredibly my third order arrived in the box associated with the product, but with a completely different product inside! ) now Asos have 3 of your payments and you have no goods.Imagine if they can scam a mere 10 people like that per week: they're holding onto funds that aren't theirs, which they can do whatever they want with. It could certainly be making them money whilst it's still in their account. I know a lot of companies do this but not for 20 DAYS!!And why the hell should it take ( they say ) 10 days for them to receive a return? Once Collect+ have scanned the parcel, it's in their system, and they know they'll get their goods back. And again, another 10 days after the return to receive a refund? Why? If it's not them utilising the funds they've robbed from us then I don't know what it. If Amazon can process a refund within three days of acknowledging the return, why can't Asos? PLEASE PEOPLE: DON'T BUY FROM ASOS, THEY ARE SCAMMERS, YOU WON'T GET YOU GOODS AND THEY'LL KEEP YOUR MONEY FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.One last thing: how come Asos never bother to reply to ANY of the reviews? They simply don't give a damn, that's why......"
"February 05, 2019",1,I left Asos for a while after a bad...,"I left Asos for a while after a bad experience with Hermes never delivering my parcel next day and constantly lying, saying I wasn‚Äôt home. Anyway, I gave Asos another go. I shouldn‚Äôt have and I‚Äôm going to close my account today. Unfortunately Asos started using Hermes again and I think it‚Äôs pretty much a common knowledge now that unless you have an extremely conscientious local driver y will not see your parcel for roughly a week. Customer service says they have no way of communicating with Hermes and act like it‚Äôs nothing to do with Asos. Asos I have news for you! It‚Äôs everything to do with you because you contracted this hopeless courier! Anyway, to put the cherry on top of the cake, the customer service just ended the chat because they couldn‚Äôt be bothered to answer my questions anymore. If your orders are delivered by DPD you‚Äôll probably be okay as long as you don‚Äôt need to contact customer services for any reason."
"February 04, 2019",1,Never received my money back,"I ordered back in December, I received my parcel on the 19th of December and decided to return on the 10th of January that is a total of 22 days I still had another six days left to return. It is now the 4th of February and I still have heard nothing and received no money back I have emailed endlessly and started numerous live chats with a chat either randomly ends or they take ages to reply, I have ordered from ASOS for years and I‚Äôm deeply disappointed with the service they have provided this time around I will never be ordering again, I have now lost money and have been completely forgotten about. On previous occasions I have received a refund within the week but I returned the items."
"February 04, 2019",1,Worst customer service ever,"I have paid additional fees to recieve the goods on time. I was contacted by Aramex that my parcel is at the destination warehouse. However. Due to licensing issues, Aramex is not able to release those items until further notice as their branches are closed. Contacted ASOS customer care, not only they provide you with copy paste scripted answers, they are not even bothered to help. Worst customer experience. Will never ever shop with ASOS again"

"February 03, 2019",4,Great value for the money,Great value for the money. Easy to order online and return. The only problems are that the sizes differ a lot and the quality of the fabric is not always great. But overall fair prices.
"February 03, 2019",1,Customer service shockingly bad,"First time I have dealt with Asos customer service team. Shockingly awful service and not helpful at all. Also ASOS if you care for your customers stop using myhermes! I contacted ASOS about my delivery, all I was told is sorry we do not have a number for them. Then why are you using a company you can‚Äôt even contact??? It‚Äôs not rocket science !!"
"February 03, 2019",1,Returned an unwanted Christmas gift,"Returned an unwanted Christmas gift on 3rd January, and they still haven‚Äôt refunded my money. They have lied and lied every time I contact them. Have handed it over to my card company to deal with. DO NOT SHOP WITH THESE THIEVES."
"February 03, 2019",1,Nightmare,Worst customer service experience ever. Somebody should stop this fraudulent company. They took my money and sent something I didn‚Äôt order and refusing to send my actual order without refund is processed which means weeks of wait... Unbelievable that they punish you for their mistake and no single apology. You cannot talk to a supervisor when you contact their customer support. It feels like talking to a machine copy pasting the same thing over and over. Make yourself a favour and shop elsewhere.
"February 03, 2019",1,‚ÄúCustomer care‚Äù who doesn‚Äôt care at all,"Totally useless when you reach out to their customer services. They call themselves ‚Äúcustomer care‚Äù but all they do is copy and paste pre-made answers that just make emails longer but with no solutions offered. I recently had a bad experience with one of my purchases, and asked for a goodwill gesture of a refund, however they kept refusing it because what happened wasn‚Äôt thei fault. However, the carrier delivered the parcel on a different day from what was said on the order, I wasn‚Äôt at home, they didn‚Äôt confirm my name and my coat got stole. They gave me a 10% discount to use for another purchase as their way to make it up, but since I had to refund the item due to wrong size, they refused to issue the 10% again, so it was a total waste.If you just shop, receive your items ok and send them back, then I guess it‚Äôs ok. But try to reach out for extra help to their ‚Äúcustomer care‚Äù and all you get is a big headache and no solutions to your issues at all. Some items they sell are good, but with such a poor level of service I will refuse to shop there in future."
"February 03, 2019",1,Terrible Service and Company,Terrible - have been shopping with them for 8 years and now for the second time in a month they have lost my order. Tried to give them the benefit of the doubt when they firstly lost it but just an awful service again. Also did not even apologize about the fact they lost it and were not helpful at all. Won‚Äôt be shopping again with them and will move to Zalando- much better standard and more brands.
"February 03, 2019",2,Worst Customer services i have seen,"These people dont have any idea of what customer service is..they are incompetent and just shut you up when they cannot solve your issue. I had an order delivered at the weong address and they ping ponged me from Hermes and back to Asos and they were incapable of doing anything for me.If you can imagina Asos cannot contact Hermes at all, and Hermes cannot change your adress even if they identify you as the owner..Asos has to instruct them and Asos is not allowed to contact Hermes, insanity!! i expect to not recover my money to be honest and i am definitely not shopping with them again."
"February 02, 2019",5,Unbeatable prices,Widest range of clothings. Quick delivery and very good for students
"February 02, 2019",1,The worst customer service ever!,"If I could have given less than one star, I would have. Placed an order valued at over ¬£100 and it was delivered to the wrong address. When telling ASOS about this they told us that it is a civil problem and we will need to find the parcel ourselves. No offer of replacements or a refund despite us mentioned that we are protected by the consumer rights act. Not that they were too bothered about that. They just kept sending the same pre-canned responses.I have asked to speak to a manager 3 times now and they aren't even acknowledging my request. I've been a customer of there's for years now and have spent thousands of pounds during this time. If this is how they treat loyal customers I can only imagine how they treat new customers! AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE."
"February 02, 2019",5,Great company great prices,"I don't work for asos nor am I getting paid to write this review.  I've been shopping with them for a couple of years, I love in the United States.  Asos has great prices very quick shipping and I have been impressed with their customer service.  Yes they don't do exchanges which sucks but they are also very quick with refunds so you can buy the right size pretty quick.  I wouldn't hesitate to continue shopping with the."
"February 02, 2019",4,Still one of the better online fashion stores,"Been buying off from ASOS for years now, never really experienced anything significantly negative and will continue to patron them. Great selection of fashion choices, fast delivery and no issue returns. Pricing is competitive but not always the cheapest."
"February 02, 2019",1,Bad customer service,"I ordered a dress, and as I hit the return button on their app it said that it created a return of the item. I go under my returns and the item isn‚Äôt there, how am I supposed to print out the return label if it isn‚Äôt there. It‚Äôs not the first time. As I go back to create the return again, the item is completely gone. So I can‚Äôt even create the return now. Last time I couldn‚Äôt return the item and now I‚Äôm stuck with three things I can‚Äôt return. This is completely idiotic, I‚Äôm very upset with this experience. I have written multiple mails and messages without any response. Save you money don‚Äôt buy from them"
"February 02, 2019",1,Unacceptable clothing sold to genuine customers,Unacceptable clothing sold to genuine customers. I bought a few shirt tops from ASOS and when I opened the package the tops smelled revolting. Obviously it's been worn and returned by the previous person who bought the tops originally. It comes to my surprise that this is not checked on returned items. This has put me off buying anything from this online retailer.
"February 02, 2019",2,WNDriect is the worst and so unfair.,"My name is Uche Jessica. I ordered some items from Asos and the expected delivery date has passed. I am a girl.   My order number is 383255469 I tried tracking it and i found out it‚Äôs in WNDirect.  I HAVEN‚ÄôT gotten any mail, message, or calls from WNDirect and that‚Äôs so unfair. I don‚Äôt know where my order is and I am so worried. I can‚Äôt even track it. The total amount of what I spent was 64.50 pounds. I need to know where my order is. You guys are so unfair."

"February 01, 2019",5,Happy customer :),"I‚Äôm shocked at all the bad reviews. I‚Äôve had nothing but good service from ASOS. I get my clothes next day and returns have been super easy for me as I can differ in size, so sometimes I need to buy two of one thing to see what fits best."
"February 01, 2019",1,Disappointing online website.,Im from Mauritius and must say a regular client to Asos. And i have not received my parcels many times but at the end had to keep on sending emails to get my refunds. I just found out that the standard delivery is now  ¬£20. And i have to buy items up ¬£200 to get free delivery to ship to Mauritius. I find this really ridiculous. Is that a new way to make money?  They could have put a significant sum like ¬£30 - to ¬£50  to obtain free shipping. Really disapointing!
"February 01, 2019",3,Mixed opinions on Asos,"Mixed opinions on Asos. Some items look great online, but look inferior in real life. Have received incorrect items several times. Hate that I have to go to the post office to send them back - the items I originally bought are out of stock by the time they receive the item back and process the order again. Chat Support is always helpful however, although very limited on what they can say and/or do."
"February 01, 2019",1,"Order not arrived, package gone missing and request for refunds ignored!","Lots of fake 5 star reviews praising this company, why isn't trustpilot cracking down on it?Ordered item via ASOS, was told it would arrive on Thursday I waited in all day and nothing arrived, checked hermes tracker who confirmed it was delivered to the warehouse. But no courier assigned. ASOS then tell me to wait until the morning as it will arrive tomorrow.Contact ASOS to complain again that the tracker wasn't updated to be told that hermes are having issues and my package is delayed for an additional 12 days, after I requested a refund.Reading between the lines it's been lost or stolen and they need to wait time until they can report the package missing leaving me without my order and out of pocket.Why oh why oh why is this company still in business?Spoke to customer support 3 times this morning requesting a refund and my complaint to be escalated to recieve blanket cut and paste responses from 3 different people reading off a script, ignoring my requests.Last time I order anything from this organisation, no concept of customer service and the countless complaints on here dont lie. Avoid like the plague!"
"February 01, 2019",1,Premium delivery is a scam!,"Premium delivery is a scam!! Don't sign up for it! I paid for UK premium delivery and assigned a next day delivery to a London address. Not only they failed to show up, lied about re-deliver later the same day, they even deliberately changed the delivery day without my consent and sent me a notification to ""confirm my request to change the delivery date"" which request I've never made!! Custom service team is a joke, I cannot get any helpful advice. They literally told me, the delivery date is an estimated date, there's no guarantee. Then why on earth did you charge your customer more for ""premium delivery"", ASOS?? I like your clothes, but your service quality is unbelievable poor! Please train your staff well enough before start providing so called ""premium service""!!"
"February 01, 2019",1,wait for several months for an answer‚Ä¶,wait for several months for an answer from customer support. i tried it several times by email. i am delayed with automated mails. i still get money. now i will have to take legal steps. an asos: your customer service used to be really good. so he earns 0 stars.
"January 31, 2019",1,Horrible company,It amazes me how this company is allowed to do business. It takes 30 days for them to process a return.  I will never use them again.
"January 31, 2019",1,Shocking customer service!,"Shocking customer service!I order at least once a month. I ordered a couple of day ago for a couple of dresses. One of the dresses I ordered was a white dress with red roses. Came home to my parcels today to find the dress that arrived was incorrect it was the wrong colour, wrong fabric and wrong length. I contact customer service straight away and spoke to a very rude lady called Abby she told me I would need to send it back and if they had any of the correct dresses they would send me one alternatively I could just order the dress again! I was disgusted by her attitude as if everyone has loads of money laying around to just order however many they want. The only way I can now get the correct dress is to re order and pray the correct one shows. She informed me if I sent the incorrect one back they wouldn‚Äôt sort anything out as that‚Äôs not their job. It would be my responsibility to reorder. Lack of customer after care is paramount! Absolutely disgraceful!"
"January 31, 2019",1,Horrific company stay a way,"I used to spend well over a thousand pounds a year with this company and now only use in desperation. Even then the customer service is poor and they don‚Äôt deliver on there promises. DPD Forged my signature, advising they delivered my item and they had not. I was advised there was nothing that could be done, this is fraud and should be taken further. I most recently ordered next day as I paid to be a premier member. I tracked the item on the day and it said ASOS hadn‚Äôt delivered the parcel. Emailed customer service advising not to bother sending as they had ruined any chances of ke attending my event and to refund me. No response of course.  On the fourth day after ordering it arrived which made me extremely mad, I contacted the team only to be sent no apology or reseluyion apart from to take time out of my day and petrol to return the item for a refund!"
"January 31, 2019",1,I am trying to spend ¬£220,"I am trying to spend ¬£220 - and had a problem with a delivery code. The customer service is a joke, truly a Kafka-esq nightmare. Do not bother engaging in conversation with them."
"January 31, 2019",3,Great delivery but weird catalogue of clothes,"I'm really surprised at all the bad reviews on here regarding delivery. I order from ASOS fairly regularly and always get my order either early or on time and returns are so easy and straight-forward.Generally, I'm very happy with my orders, although finding stuff that I like can be difficult. A lot of clothes are so close to being really nice but there's always something a little off. It could be anything from extra ruffles or weird colours to a strange cut. Despite this I always find myself coming back to see what's new and I generally find their simpler clothes to be quite nice.I also primarily get my jeans from here although this can also be a bit dicey. I regularly order the Curve Ridley Jeans and I recently ordered 2 pairs - one dark blue wash and one a 'nanette darkwash', the dark blue wash fitted as normal but the nanette darkwash was very loose. They were the exact same style and size of jean but there was such disparity in how they fit, it was very strange. But I kept both and use the latter when I want a very casual outfit.If I could, I would give ASOS 3.5 stars, they're not quite at 4 or 5 stars given the outlined issues above."
"January 31, 2019",1,Terrible when anything goes wrong,Fine when deliveries go to plan but so incredibly unhelpful when something goes wrong! You can only talk to them on social media or live chat so you have to wait ages for a response and then when you finally get it all they do is spout the same rubbish that is no help what so ever. I have premier service (cost ¬£9.95) which guarantees next day delivery and they're saying for me to get back in contact with them if I haven't received the order 10 days after I ordered it. They refuse to cancel and refund the order or reissue the products

"January 31, 2019",1,"App has bugs, service team unhelpful","Ordered express shipping but their iPhone app glitched (while checking out with Apple Pay) and it processed with standard shipping, meaning my items wouldn't make it in time for a friend's birthday. Brought it up with staff who at first didn't believe I had even ordered anything because they couldn't find my order in their system. When they finally found it, they were completely unhelpful and blamed me for not selected the express shipping method - which I carefully explained was not presented to me due to a bug with their app. I asked for an immediate refund and to cancel my order, which they refused to do as ""it was not possible"", even though they hadn't shipped it yet.My only option was to order the same items again with Express postage, and refund the first delivery when it finally arrives. Horrible standards for such a big online retailer"

No reimbursements, no sympathy towards what has happened.CS person that I spoke to was called Nadia, if you are ever on live chat with her, just exit and go to someone else as she was awful and extremely unhelpful."
"January 30, 2019",1,worst experience ever,"I've made an order the beginning of January and and after 3 weeks of delivery delay ( every day they were changing the date), I've contacted the CS and they find out that half of the stuff that I've ordered 3 weeks prior, were out of stock and they refund me the money after 30days. Now, I was suppose to get the rest of the order tomorrow... well, delayed again of 8 days... Soooo bad! worst experience ever!won't buy ever again on asos and please do the same!"

"January 29, 2019",1,Unacceptable,"Order number 380216326: I ordered ¬£121 worth of clothes from ASOS, I did not allow parcels to be left in a safe place in my settings as I live in a block of flats and it‚Äôs not secure. My order arrived at 13.25 on a Monday whilst I was at work, nobody was at home however it was marked as signed for by me. An obvious lie. No sign of the parcel, I checked with my neighbours and any ‚Äúsafe place‚Äù they may have put it, still no parcel. I got in touch with customer care who said they‚Äôd take it up with DPD and would take 3-5 working days. A week goes by and I receive no update so follow it up myself, they say that the parcel was delivered correctly. I ask to see the signature and they send it across, literally a scribble, not my signature. I reply telling them this. They refuse to take it any further and say the case is closed. I am extremely frustrated with the customer service, they have not listened to me and not done all they can. I do not trust Asos delivery and customer care now and will no longer be using their service. They even got my name wrong in the email where they said  ‚ÄúI understand how frustrating this is on your end and I can assure you that we are constantly changing and trying to improve the service we provide for the people that are most important to us and that is certainly you Leah. I can also see that through our investigation that DPD has done all the relevant investigation which has now been closed and so we are confident that it was delivered.‚Äù My name is not Leah.

When I wrote an e-mail to delivery service to complaint and I received immediate response that they would deliver on the day after and they did, so I was impressed with their behavior although they was late. Finally, quality of jacket is good but delivery is not too good"
"January 29, 2019",1,How frustrating..!!,"I had no email to confirm that ASOS had even received my returned parcel. I had to prompt a refund to be processed myself...!!Very frustrating.Oh, and I was also sent the wrong size so had to order again?! No apology received. Thoroughly disappointing considering the price of products and the popularity of the company. I am happy enough with my purchase but will not be ordering from here again... after reading bad review, upon bad review, I understand that this is a widespread opinion. I would not trust this company, as popular and legit as they may seem from the outside looking in."
"January 29, 2019",1,Awful customer service,"Asos refunded me for the wrong item, when I'd asked for an exchange. then told me I'd have to just reorder the item. They wouldn't offer me any kind of discount as an apology and when I asked to talk to a manager the person I talked to on chat just ended it. This was my third time trying the chat, I'd been ignored for over half an hour by the first two. Absolutely disgusting customer service, the site is fine as long as you don't have any issues."
"January 29, 2019",1,Unreliable service,"Do not order from this site if you need your items by a certain date. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you pay extra for next day delievery, the items will never reach you and they will refuse to refund you. Disgusting service, will be avoiding them in future"
"January 29, 2019",1,Terrible customer service,"Terrible customer service Web chat advisors cut you off and end chat when they can‚Äôt be bothered to solve your problemLike paying for premier delivery next day and when it didn‚Äôt arrive they tried to tell me the delivery carrier had not updated correctly, contacted again only for them to try tell me what premier delivery meant as if I didn‚Äôt know, I hadn‚Äôt received my item next day which is premier delivery Afer placing many orders with them 90% of what I ordered came seriously flawed or looked like it had been used already, clearly not new or acceptable condition.Won‚Äôt be using this website again"
"January 28, 2019",1,TERRIBLE customer service experience,"TERRIBLE customer service experience.  Absolutely abysmal.  They don't even read your email queries.  They simply copy and paste the same generic vague response over and over again that doesn't even come close to answering your question.  After 4 emails sent with the same response I had to type an email in capital letters to have them actually read what I was asking them.  Even then, they took almost 2 weeks to respond after having to follow up yet again only to have them come to the same conclusion that I'm able to to return my ill-fitting items for a flat fee that they seemed to have just made up as no delivery service has been able to quote me this price. Don't let the website fool you with the bold print going across their landing page saying ""Free returns"".  This is untrue.  Also don't believe what they state as the flat return shipping cost for Canada.  This is also untrue.  Also  had to pay a significant duty fee for their ""Free Shipping"" as well which they don't quote you for or even mention as something to expect when putting your order in.It is truly despicable the kind of service they deliver for an online retailer.  Definitely do not recommend purchasing from here and I will certainly never buy from them again."
"January 28, 2019",1,Don‚Äôt ever pay for next delivery,Don‚Äôt ever pay for next delivery it seems to be that you get your order faster going with free standard day delivery.

"January 27, 2019",5,Surprised to see how many low reviews‚Ä¶,"Surprised to see how many low reviews here - personally, I have been shopping with ASOS for more than a year, and this has grown to become my go-to place for online shopping, and they always manage to have anything I am looking for. On top of this, shipping is insanely fast. If there's a huge sale though (e.g. Black Friday), expect a slight delay, which I have experienced. But other than that, I'm impressed with the quality, service and shipping speed - most of my orders have arrived 3 days before the expected delivery date, which keeps me coming back to shopping with ASOS as well.Based on my experience so far, I recommend shopping at ASOS, especially when it comes to their sales."
"January 27, 2019",1,THE WORST customer service,"THE WORST customer service. I paid ¬£9.95 for next day 'premium' delivery. NOTHING ABOUT THIS DELIVERY WAS OF A PREMIUM STANDARD. Not only did my parcels get stolen, but they were delivered to random neighbours, never received a calling card, still waiting for one parcel to arrive after 5+ days after paying next day delivery. Maybe we have different calendars, because NEXT DAY DELIVERY TO ME ISN'T 5 DAYS LATER. Replies from customer service include ""Your patience is much appreciated"". YES MY PATIENCE IS MUCH APPRECIATED I WAITED FOR THIS STUPID ASOS PARCEL ON MY BIRTHDAY, PLEASE ASOS AND DPD GET YOUR STUFF TOGETHER. Ok rant over. Not impressed."

The tracking number showed the order already returned back to ASOS. Now, it is more than three months fighting with ASOS to refund me $195.5 and they have not issue it yet. They are trying not to refund me without any valid reason. I will sue asos.com. I was a regular customer with ASOS.com but now I will not buy again from them. Be careful. Don‚Äôt buy from ASOS.com.

Yes you pay for your clothes but the clothes you receive are always good quality. Fast delivery every time I purchase, and always comes well wrapped in the traditional ASOS packaging. I look forward to receiving a purchase and I also enjoy that they enable you to pay later which I‚Äôve used a fair amount of times and never had a problem with :)"

The courier once delivered my parcel to someone else without trying to deliver to me first even though I was at home he didn't bother ringing the bell, but that's just Hermes being... Well, Hermes.Customer service at Asos is not so polite as other places, I found some customer service representatives via chat being less than patient and get irritated rather quickly. Nevertheless of course they still tried to help.I never once had to call this company but I found it annoying how they made it so hard to just email them without going through the stupid online form, honestly. Provide all your details as a company and us customers won't be so dramatic!In terms of delivery they are super quick it's amazing and returns as well they are amazingly fast. Using Klarna with this company is the cherry on cake!! Can't-stop-shopping!!"

"January 25, 2019",2,Customer service like robots,I pay an extra ¬£9.99 per year for next day delivery. Most of the time my orders arrive in the allotted time. However when they don't their customer service are lacking in empathy and do not help to solve the problem. Delivery time today between 10-12pm its now 15:13 and no parcel. Asos customer service tell me to wait until tomorrow to get in touch. Not really good enough when I need the item TODAY.
"January 25, 2019",1,Don‚Äôt bother,Wow!  Well I will say the closing is cute enough. On the other hand don‚Äôt even try to make a return if it doesn‚Äôt fit. I have been waiting for my refund for $60 for the past month and I have had over 11 correspondence back-and-forth with no resolution. I have literally made returns back to China faster than this. I am beyond frustrated and even if I loved one of their pieces I will never order it  just because of how I‚Äôm being treated at this point!

"January 25, 2019",5,1st time shopper with Asos.com and Paypal,1st time shopper with Asos.com and purchased a ASOS DESIGN Curve denim overall dress in vintage blue and used Paypal to process this on-line transaction.  My 1st order was sent out wrong size and wrong color. I reached out to ASOS by instant messenger chat and that got me nowhere also tried thru email the same results.  Customer service is poor & since ASOS does not provide a toll free customer inquiry or customer service line - Your Ship out of luck!!! Lucky for me I used Paypal because they assisted me with the return and paypal tracking and processed my refund!!!
"January 25, 2019",5,Great items and customer service,"I don't usually write reviews but saw so many bad ones so thought I should share my experience. I've ordered off ASOS a few times and never had any issues before but the most recent order that I placed I had delivered to my local parcel shop, the order said it had all arrived but yet when I received it half was missing. I opened an online chat with someone who passed my case onto a specialist and said they would be in touch within 24 hours (after reading the bad reviews I was very scared I would not received my items at all) . 2 hours later I had been contacted by email to apologise for the delay and that I would have the rest of my items dispatched with next day delivery. The items arrived next day as stated and all my items were there. Yes, there was a little glitch to begin with but I can honestly say it does not put me off using them and I will certainly be buying the delivery pass in future!"
"January 25, 2019",5,perfect quality and price!,"First time I‚Äôve purchased from ASOS and I‚Äôm glad I bought from there! True to size, I bought a denim jacket which is perfect and great value for money!! Love love love!!"
"January 25, 2019",1,Sent wrong item. Poor customer service.,"I live overseas and ordered a new bikini for my first proper holiday in 10 years. When the order arrived, they had sent me two bikini bottoms, instead of the top and bottom. The bottoms costs 30% less than the top. I contacted ASOS via their website and was told I would have to send the bikini bottoms back before they would send out a replacement. Or order again and wait for my order to come and then wait for my refund. I could not get anywhere with customer service. They just point blank refused to send a replacement and I did not have time to return them. Poor show ASOS, I have been a customer of yours for many years."
"January 25, 2019",5,Superb customer service experience!,One time I had an item that got lost midst shipping and I emailed them and they sent a new one within a day without extra charge. Very good customer service!
"January 25, 2019",4,Reliable. Fast shipping,"Ordered here many times now. Shipping is fast. Items usually turn out like they show them on their site. Only once did I have an issue with an item I returned, where Asos didn't repay for several weeks. Once I contacted customer service the issue was resolved smoothly."
"January 25, 2019",1,Ordered a pair of $300 shoes which were‚Ä¶,"Ordered a pair of $300 shoes which were in stock on their website. Received the package two days later, with the correct shoe box, correct shoe tissue but absolutely the wrong pair of shoes. When I contacted customer service they offered me a refund if I return the shoes and free shipping if I reorder. Will have to wait almost 1 month for refund because they packed a Parcel Return Label for USPS for returns (which could take 2 weeks to arrive) and it takes 10 days after they receive to issue a credit/refund. Literally the refund and free shipping are already parts of their service as I didn't pay for shipping when I ordered the item. Customer service is unable to provide any retaining value. I'm 100% expecting them to refuse my refund after they ""investigate"" at which time I will be seeking punitive measures. Literally save yourself and do NOT ORDER FROM THIS UNTRUSTWORTHY COMPANY."
"January 24, 2019",1,Poor Customer Service in Live Chat,"My daughter had a complaint, so she went to web chat to help resolve the issue. The agent who dealt with her query basically said 'I can't change policy' and ended the chat, completely cutting her off and leaving her upset and frustrated. Appauling Service. You can't just hang up on someone when they're not finished speaking to you because you can't be bothered to help them anymore!"
"January 24, 2019",1,No answer to emails after a complaint‚Ä¶,"An expensive ""Emporio Armani"" long sleeves polo was ordered and Asos sent a hoodie with no sleeves!I sent three emails to Asos customer services but i've never been repaid and they did not send the right product. Scornful behavior.This company is now banned."

"January 24, 2019",1,terrible customer service and delivery,"I received a gift voucher as a birthday present. After searching for months for something I could by it was so much hassle trying to put all my details in and for them to accept the voucher. The order was then placed and was due to come on Thursday. I woke up on Thursday and then record an email stating that my parcel had tried to be delivered but no one was in. This was false as I definitely was in and no slip had been put through the door like they would normally do. I reached out to ASOS on 2 live chats and both showed very very poor customer service, the first blamed me for this and the second one stated that my parcel was still to come- neither of them took any responsibility for the fact I got an email confirming that my parcel had tried to be delivered, all I wanted to know was what happened and when it would be coming. Customer service is very poor and I still haven‚Äôt received my parcel. Will not shop from here ahain"
"January 24, 2019",1,"Lazy, impersonal, careless","The most impersonal and lazy customer service I have ever had. I used the online chat, there was 5 minutes between me typing and them replying which made me feel that my complaint didn't matter from the get go. To top that off I was told I had to wait until midnight for my delivery and only after then when it definitely hadn't been delivered on that day could they engage in a conversation with me about where my order was. I felt like I was either being lied to or dismissed the whole time. In addition to this when I followed up for a refund on my next day delivery I was told they would look in to it and get back to me, I can't comprehend that their system is so complicated to use that they can't see within seconds whether the delivery arrived the day it was meant to. In addition to this when I asked to escalate my complaint and receive a call back from a manager to discuss customer service experience, I was redirected to emailing them (as if I hadn't already contacted them several times) and then not even given the email address? Honestly need to pull their finger out, ASOS website is great but as soon as there's an issue you'll wish you never shopped there. Will be going straight to actual retailers going forward. Spent 19 minutes today on their chat service, all to be told ""we will look in to it"", took me less time to write this review..."

"January 23, 2019",1,If you have a complaint then use Resolver,"I have used Asos for years without an issue. The first time I ever had cause for complaint I contacted their ‚Äòcustomer service‚Äô team and was constantly talked over, sighed at and cut off. Nothing was followed up and I had to contact them over 20 times for the issue to finally be resolved. Asos have serious problems when it comes to customer service. Whilst the shopping experience is great, they need to focus on improving their customer service. I would recommend anyone to make any complaint you might have via ‚ÄòResolver‚Äô. Once I logged my complaint through this, I finally gained a satisfactory resolution."
"January 23, 2019",3,Overall good but hard to contact customer services,I've ordered from ASOS many times and haven't had any major problems. Delivery usually quick. One problem is no phone number for customer services and only chat facility or Facebook. My daughter had some jeans and seam came undone on first wear and initially they weren't going to refund me. I had to threaten them with trading standards. Mostly though have been fine no problems.
"January 23, 2019",1,All good until your parcel is missing,It‚Äôs the second time in one month I have been chasing my parcel.It‚Äôs now stuck with the courier but asos is not willing to resolve it for whatever reason.

"January 22, 2019",1,Worst company to order from,"ASOS has a obligation to give you, as a paying customer, an estimate cost of customs and duties when a product that you have ordered is being imported into Canada. I was charged $43.00 on a $94.00 dress, plus $15.00 shipping. I had NO idea it was going to cost $43.00 to import a cheap dress into Canada. I work with customs brokers every day, and there is no way it should cost that much. Just to recap: $53.00 to get a $94.00 dress across the border from the US to Canada. What's funny is that I do a lot of cross-border shopping, and it has NEVER cost that much for duties and taxes to import products into Canada. I'll never shop with them again. Absolute crooks. Even when I chatted with them to see what the deal was, they blamed it on Canada's import charges. Well that's bullsh*t. They should have the estimated cost of import duties listed before completing your order so you can make the choice if you want to order a cheap dress from ASOS, or a decent quality dress from somewhere else for less money. Shame on you ASOS. What a rip off. And the best part? You have to pay it all over again to return the item! Maybe be honest explain to your customers the COMPLETE cost of ordering from your company, rather than surprise them with costs that they should have known they were going to have to pay."
"January 22, 2019",1,Horrible Customer Service and a very cheap company,"I ordered a bunch of stuff about two weeks ago, including an eyeliner. The eyeliner's box came empty in a sealed bag. It was clearly stolen by some of their staff. I contacted customer service for a replacement and all they did was to paste some irrelevant generic info. I had to return the item for a replacement or refund. That means I have to pay transportation and send an empty box back to them. Unacceptable services. P.S. The customer service chat is the most awful I've ever encountered. They couldn't wait to shut down the chat box."

ASOS not interested, eventually filed PayPal claim but this was not honoured as ASOS stated it had been posted. When you use EBay it is sellers responsibility to ensure delivery and PayPal gives refund. Not happy with either companies. Will never use ASOS again."

"January 21, 2019",1,Very narrowed attitude,"Very narrowed attitude, ignorant service. Representatives that read from the policy page to you and then immediately shut the chat window down. A company that could not give its customers a fair, SENSIBLE service and FLEXIBLE solutions to situation which happen should not claim money from them. I hope if ASOS won't align its quality of service to the standard of these days, it will shut down in same velocity as its rude representatives shut down the chat windows with its customers"
"January 21, 2019",2,Outdated online shopping and poor levels of stock,"The moment a product goes on sale (i.e.- when it is closer to the real value, because let's face it, ASOS stock poor quality items most of the time) it sells out almost immediately and is never restocked. Customer services were completely unable to help with questions about stock. I think ASOS are really lagging behind other competitors who now have an email update function to let you know when items come back in stock."

I got an email 72 hours later saying that I HAVE BEEN BLOCKED from all contact with Asos and they will not be responding to me, that my entire account is blocked and they wont be helping me at all and I can contact my bank.I had outstanding refunds i was waiting for and they just deleted my account!!!!! My package didn't show up and I get no explanation as to why?!?!?!!?!?!I reported this to my bank and am reporting this to the police.I cannot recommend ASOS, will not be purchasing from them again, and how terrible.

This year I purchased next-day delivery service, and this has proven as one of the greatest mistakes I have ever made.Spending ¬£9.99 on the so called 'Next-day delivery' and have two deliveries out of three never arrived on the next day. Contacted customer service online and all that I received were copy-and-paste canned templates that were irrelevant.And then this staff, who referred herself as 'Imani', should be awarded the best employee of ASOS. I witnessed the best way to deliberately shut customer up when there is anything out of her competency :'As I have advised all I can I will now go ahead and close the chat.'Unbelievable.I was in the Customer Service sector and I can admit that I once thought I was talking to scammers here. All that I have experienced have violated the big no-nos of the CS profession. I am shocked to see a big e-commerce like ASOS would allow such service standard as if I was in a random deep web merchandising.To ASOS management (if there is even one) - I do not know how much you paid your online CS that made them treat customers like that - Hopefully not, but I wouldn't be surprised, if the people I was speaking with were some high school part-time who did not even know how to deal with problems in the real world of work."

They didn't tell me this until several hours later, by which time it was too late for the gift card to be still given as a gift anyway.I tried to get them to explain why over several emails: I received a mixture of bot responses, canned responses that were not relevant, and responses that refused to acknowledge the problem or explain it.I was eventually told that further emails would be ignored and then deactivated my account. And no, I was not rude in my correspondence as you might assume."

Earlier this month I made an order on this website and the estimated delivery was 12th January. On the 13th I tried to track my order due to it being late and it could not find it. I emailed and messaged them on Twitter to inform them. Finally on the 18th January I got my parcel in the post. But when I came to open it I realised it was not ge order I made. I informed ASOS right away to let them know I was dissappionted with this service. I received a reply to say I‚Äôd have to return this order and I would get a full refund but I would not get my correct order in return because they would have to look into this. I felt that I had to go out of my way to return this product for a mistake they had made. I will not be ordering from ASOS again.

"January 17, 2019",1,I would not even rate asos 1 star,"I would not even rate asos 1 star! Their customer service is disgusting!!! When things goes wrong they are the absolute worst company EVERRRRRR to deal with. One month today I made an order next day delivery in which the DPD driver delivered to the wrong address. I informed both companies to be told conflicting information and lies especially from ASOS. No effort to resolve it and yet a month later I still have not been issued a refund, even though they are more than aware that the parcel had not been received by me. To make it worst I was told a couple of days ago it had finally been sorted and an issue refunded to find out today they had no record of this and it would yet again take a further 24hrs to be dealt with within the refunds department. I have been told nonsense for the past month. I have never experienced anything like it!! So annoyed because they sell amazing stuff, but it‚Äôs really not worth the stress when it goes wrong!!"
"January 17, 2019",1,Atrocious Review is ASOS,"I fundamentally disagree with ASOS decisions in my case. They have refused to acknowledge that items were missing when they delivered the bag falling to pieces. and have made the decision to stop replying to emails from me because they have closed my account, despite me ordering from them on many occasions and also when that is not conducive to resolving the issue. The bag was split when it arrived, as I noted with yourself and the driver, and yet I am being penalised for ASOS packing the bags too heavy and for disregarding your poor customer service in resolving the issue. I am not in any way a liar and I am extremely disappointed with the situation. The items may be elsewhere in the delivery network but they have done nothing to check this and have placed sanctions on my account that are uncalled for, unexpected and downright unfair. I feel completely victimised by their errors and I will be taking this complaint further with further negative reviews online, with my credit card issuer, Hermes and the ombudsman."
"January 17, 2019",1,Lost a costumer before you had me...,I was just about to order from this company and decided to look at the reviews first.  Seeing so many negative things said about what happened to people‚Äôs orders and how this company did not seem to care or go out of their way to help solve the problem.  I won‚Äôt be ordering from ASOS.  I‚Äôll pay more and directly order from adidas to get the shoes I wanted.
"January 17, 2019",1,Received an item that was faulty,"Received an item that was faulty. Really needed this particular item for an event I was running. Although they offered to refund if I returned the item, they could not replace it as they had sold out. they offered to cover the cost of repair but only if I provided a quote written on headed paper, which none of my local shops were prepared to do. So I'm left with an overpriced item which will cost me an additional ¬£10 to repair their fault. Won't be using them again in the future."
"January 17, 2019",3,Ordered a mens' overcoat,Ordered a mens' overcoat. The coat itself was excellent quality (One & Co) but why the hell it was squashed into a tiny ASOS plastic bag I'll never know. It took days for the creases to drop out and I eventually had to take it to the local ironing company to be professionally pressed. The bag was about 30cm square and that had a man's wool overcoat stuffed in it!!So 5 star rating for the actual product and only 3 stars (and I'm being generous) for the packaging by ASOS.
"January 17, 2019",5,Love ASOS,"Love ASOS and use them on a regular basis. ¬£10 for all year round next day delivery is a bargain and they have a huge selection of products to choose from that I don't need to leave the house for. As a busy customer with little time for getting to a major city to spend the day walking round stores this is ideal. Had 1 issue on a delivery in about 12 years and ASOS sent a replacement order (although the service was a little slow on this). However mistakes happen and if it one in 100 orders then I don't have an issue. Bought plenty of ASOS own label stuff too which are normally a great price too. Quality not the same as designer, but I wouldn't expect it to be. Stock plenty of brands too from high street to your Ralph Lauren's etc"
"January 17, 2019",5,Best online clothing company!!,"I wouldn‚Äôt fault ASOS. Use them numerous times a month and never had any issues. I have next day for delivery for a year, and only once has it not arrived the next day (during Black Friday when they was extremely busy) which was understandable!"
"January 17, 2019",1,They suspended my account because I‚Ä¶,"They suspended my account because I inquired about a return. One was processed in a timely manner, the other was not and when I inquired about this they kept saying ""wait 12 days.. wait another 12 days etc.. a member of our specialist team will get back to you"" and of course no one ever does. They also closed the chat window on me numerous times and said there is nothing they can do for me. How about investigate? I proceeded to reclaim my money through my credit card company and then funnily enough, my return was suddenly processed. I let me credit card company know that I finally received my money back. This was one of the worst customer service experiences I ever had. They send canned messages and provide no help or look into your account at all. I have a voucher to use at ASOS (that I wanted to use up and then be done with the company), but strangely every time I place an order, it gets cancelled. I think they banned me. All because I inquired about a lost/delayed return. Horrible company with unethical business practices. How they are still in business is very puzzling to me. I have been a loyal customer, spending thousands for nearly a decade and this is how they treated me."
"January 16, 2019",1,MESSED UP DELIVERY ADDRESS AND APPALLING CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Last two orderers I placed were delivered to an old address, despite me checking to ensure my current delivery address is inputted. Thus, the second order I made I checked 3 times to ensure that the address was correct, and even deleted the old one from the website AND made my new address the default one. Despite this, the parcel was delivered to the old address and I had to waste time and money on travel to collect it myself! When speaking to a member of customer services called Callum, I was made to feel stupid, even though I am 1000% sure it was not my error on either of the occasions. I have always been a loyal customer, but I am more than disappointed, especially at how customer services have treated me, completely dismissing my query (despite explaining very thoroughly that there was NO WAY that my device inputted the wrong address since it is not saved on it). I even did some searching online and other people have had the EXACT same issue. Still, I was met with a blatantly copied and pasted response from above stating that it was not their fault, and therefore implying that I am either lying or simply stupid. EXTREMELY disappointed with the lack of help I received and will most definitely will be contacting the head office to complain. Unacceptable treatment of customers."
"January 16, 2019",5,I love ASOS!!!,"I do most of my shopping on ASOS, it‚Äôs the best.Don‚Äôt quite understand how it‚Äôs got so many bad reviews. The sandals come up a bit funny on me but that‚Äôs no reason to complain about the shoes like the person below, just return them and move on with life hun! üòäI have next day delivery for the year which always arrives the next day. Free returns as well - you can‚Äôt go wrong!"
"January 16, 2019",2,ASOS needs more transparency,"ASOS needs more transparency in their ordering process. They claim they offer tracking but all I get is a vague delivery estimate and a ""click here for live updates"" that leads to a page of general shipping information. It seems designed to dupe you and I feel like a fool for ordering from them not just once but twice. Especially since their website doesn't allow product reviews. I received the second order today and the product is nice, but I didn't expect to get dinged with an $18 customs fee when my order was <$70. Still waiting on the first order placed almost a month ago and scared of how much I'll have to pay on that. This website is probably worth the hype if you live in the UK or anywhere they cater to better than here. When it comes down to it, I could have spent the same amount at higher-end Canadian stores instead of trying to find deals online!"
"January 16, 2019",1,Asos deserve no rating at all APPAULING COMPANY,"Asos deserve no rating at all! appalling company and extremely disheartening of how they treated my issue, I ordered 11 items and when the package turned up 4 items were missing!! I contacted ASOS about the missing items which they then opened an investigation for. They came back to me saying they can not refund my missing items of ¬£364 and immediately shutdown my account! Victimising and making me out to be the liar and theif. Awful company they blame you for their mistakes. Someone making bad decisions at top of this company needs firing."
"January 16, 2019",1,Super bad company,Buy 3 things on the 6. Of the month. Write Them 2 times. They dont know anything. Feels like You Write to a bot. Then at the 16. Get Money back because they forgot your order. And now dont have the items in stock.  0/5 enjoy.

"January 15, 2019",2,Asos shoes never fit properly,Asos shoes never fit properly and they never leave enough room for a comfortable fit. I ordered boots from them which were wide fit. They were comfortable but very narrow around the toe area as if the shoes were an exact size eight. There was not one millimetre of room to even wriggle my toes. They do this every time with their own brand shoes and boots the sizing is very poor. I would have had to buy a size 8.5 or 9 for them to be a decent fit. The price they charge for their own brand shoes is not reflective of the poor fit and poorer quality of their footwear. This time I really will stop buying their footwear and stick to other brands.
"January 15, 2019",1,Terrible experience,"Terrible experience, bad customer service not to mention I requested regular mail, they sent it ups and customs were MORE than the so called discounts"
"January 15, 2019",4,FINE,"It is the first time that i order something from asos and i was a little concerned because of all the bad critics and the poor ratings here.My order came on time, and all the products were right.My only complain is that the quality of a pair of shoes that i ordered wasn't the best and the size was larger than i expected.But generally i am satisfied!"
"January 14, 2019",1,Very disappointing!,"Very disappointed in Asos , i have recently received gift cards for Asos but when I try and put them into my account it is saying I have already registered the cards to the account . Has anybody else hadn‚Äôt the same issues if so is there a solution."
"January 14, 2019",1,"Awful, something has changed","Awful. Something has changed in asos, now the returns cost and the customer service was not only rude but also useless and didn't answer my questions. I had to ask the same things for like three times. Also my shipping took longer than they said. I also made an order before christmas and that order was also late. Most of their own brand clothes are poor quality, but they have always been that way.I used to shop from asos a lot but never again..."
"January 14, 2019",1,My name signed for by the DPD delivery driver,"Ordered a parcel back in November, never received the parcel ( I have the premier delivery package) so waited a couple of days before I made contact with them, only to be told the delivery was made and signed by me.That would have been difficult as I was 100 miles away on business.It transpires that the DPD delivery driver signed for it. I made a complaint to DPD, who said they would investigate and sent the driver around to my house. What an absolute liberty!I even drove to the DPD depot, where the manager agreed that my signature does not match the signature, they have or any previous signatures.Yet Asos will not refund my money. 17 emails and numerous live chats, I keep getting the same bullsh@t, we are looking into it.They are an absolute disgrace, if you don‚Äôt get your order for whatever reason, you‚Äôre f*@%ed"
"January 14, 2019",4,I buy most of my clothes here,"I buy most of my clothes here, I see many people haven't been so lucky, but I never had to deal with their customer care. Anyhow, the service has always been good in my experience!"
"January 14, 2019",1,Rubbish,Rubbish! The quality has gone downhill and you cannot speak to an actual person when there is a problem it's all done on live chat. Love chat takes ages to connect and then another 10 or so mins for them to respond. Emails are slow as well. Still have yet to receive an apology for them messing up my orders.
"January 14, 2019",1,shocking and rude,Had an awful experience where they lost an order placed before Christmas. I then emailed to ask for a refund and they didn‚Äôt respond. I then got a chat associate on the line a few days later that I asked for a refund. This associate fobbed me off to a ‚Äòspecialist‚Äô (delivery team) who re-sent the order without checking with me. I wanted to cancel and refund the order. I then received progressively rude emails from a number of associates when I‚Äôd asked for a manager to resolve this. They seemed annoyed that I wouldn‚Äôt just go away. Worst customer service ever. They then went on to tell me that it was ‚Äòmy responsibility‚Äô to return the parcel. Awful.
"January 14, 2019",1,Worst experience with online shopping,Worst experience ever.. My package was delivered to a wrong address and customer service is not willing to help me. They just don't care and won't send me my refund. No wonder why they have terrible reviews. Never buying from this online store again. I lost 200 dlls.

Unfortunately, my order never arrived and DPD claim that it was signed for (which it wasn't as I wasn't home). At first, ASOS appeared really helpful, but as DPD continued to claim it had been delivered, ASOS merely apologised and said there was nothing they could do. Really disappointed that ASOS have let a loyal customer take the fall for their (and DPD's) failure to deliver. Absolutely useless."

I followed directions for the return and sent it via US Post with their return label, and they refuse to assist me on refunding my money. I thankfully purchased through PayPal, but I'm doubting they will assist me. This company has not been helpful whatsoever, accusing me of keeping item and trying to get money back. I could never do that. I wanted the boots so bad, but they just didn't fit me. Now it's been over a month, and I'm out $150. I highly recommend staying with American companies and bypassing this one.***Update: got PayPal involved and they decided in my favor. Received full refund back ***"

I contacted the customer rep telling her that my offer said it was applied to the order, however when I got a text from DHL to pay for my customs fee $82 (because I live in Canada), I reviewed my order and the code was not applied. The customer rep told me nothing could be done at this point and my only option is to resend the package back (would be about $50)and replace the order. I‚Äôve never received crappier service than from ASOS. This will be my first and last time ordering from them."
"January 12, 2019",5,Awesome clothes,"Awesome clothes, quick shipping! One item didn't work out (pay attention to their size recommendation), so I had to ship it back. They are speedy with return credits as well. There was one small issue; however, they emailed me back and fixed it immediately. Extremely happy with the clothes and customer service."
"January 12, 2019",1,Never again,"I placed an order for delivery on Thursday paid for next day delivery, Friday the delivery didnt show up... DPD problem faur enough. Gauranteed it would come Saturday, get an email saying bow it will be delivered Monday, called DPD to be advised ASOS changed the delivery date. Contacted asos told them I'd  like to cancel the order and just want my money back. Live chat customer service was appalling and email was even worse. No refund offer for delivery fiasco and wont cancel or refunds my order. Purchase was to wear out Saturday night"
"January 12, 2019",4,"Bad reviews aplenty, but...","I have shopped with ASOS around 3 times. No bumps in the road ever and I live in Australia. I guess I‚Äôm one of the lucky ones judging by the other reviews! Items are true to size, and fabrics are good (if you‚Äôre specifically looking for them- so many polyester and other synthetic fabric items). Items wear for a long time. Only thing is express shipping takes a week if not more. Too long for express."
"January 11, 2019",1,Very disappointed with ASOS service,"Very disappointed with ASOS customer care. This Christmas Season i decided to purchase some friends gifts from ASOS and as it seems it was a very big mistake. One of the gifts was a Candlelight scented candle which arrived in a small carton box with a relevant label confirming that it was just that. So, i did not bother to open it and gift wrapped it and gave it to my friend yesterday when i got the chance to see her. To my surprise in the box there was no Candle, just a coffee mug with the letter ""C"" printed on it, even though the box still stated otherwise and the order was not that mug. In any case i told my friend to keep it since it was a gift and that i will be contacting the customer care to let them know of what happened. To my surprise and even though i had explained the situation to the customer representative and also supplied the necessary evidence pictures, i was requested to ask for the gift back!!! and to return it in order to get a refund. Note that the whole value of the item is just a few pounds, so who would actually go through the process of asking a gift back just to get a refund?!? I was expecting a much better approach from a store which claims to be market leader in Europe and also taking responsibility about their mistakes is not optional especially in cases where the fault is clearly an internal error!! There are online companies out there with much customer care and i'm sorry this is what ASOS has become!!"
"January 11, 2019",5,very happy with the service and‚Ä¶,"very happy with the service and product. product was dispatched within 24 hours after the purchase, delivered quickly. had to return one of the item though. but package contained free return delivery labels, so hassle free."
"January 10, 2019",5,Best online clothes retailer,"Always been pleased with asos‚Äô quick delivery times and low prices. Their in house items are also very reasonably priced and good quality (minus the tracksuit bottoms which are pretty awful, everything else has been very good though). Some of these other people need to be reasonable and not expect big gift cards every time something is delayed or something similar (which isn‚Äôt often.) you‚Äôre already getting free returns and FREE next day delivery for a year for under ¬£10. Never received a damaged item either. They‚Äôre also very lenient with their returns, unlike some others. Don‚Äôt listen to some of these reviews bashing them about it, I get the feeling they‚Äôre the sort to order 10 items, return 9, 3 weeks later after wearing them and then complain that they‚Äôre not accepted for being worn, damaged, stained etc. If this is your first time ordering from ASOS you won‚Äôt be disappointed."
"January 10, 2019",1,Terrible Customer Service,"This customer service for even the most minuscule things, is an absolute joke. Literally all they do is copy/paste text from the FAQ and send it to you over and over again, a trained monkey could do better."
"January 10, 2019",2,Horrendous customer experience,"Horrendous customer experience. The customer care team are not aligned, they don't speak to each other - you'll get one reply off one of the team, then another one will message you with different information an hour later. The past few parcels I've ordered have been either damaged, late or lost. They don't have direct communication with any of their couriers which as a result means parcels don't turn up - ASOS try to blame the couriers but then the couriers blame ASOS. Majority of products are not worth the money. The only saving grace is free returns."
"January 10, 2019",1,Don't recommend,"Really nice clothing but they don't care of their customers. I paid for the 1 day premium delivery and from many order almost none of them came on time. Customer care NEVER offers anything more than ""sorry"" even if t they don't deliver the package for many days or simply don't deliver because the item was out of stock (even though there was no information in the order status whatsoever). All in all the experience is really disappointing."
"January 10, 2019",5,Recommend to anyone,"Favourite site. Fast deliveries and super fast returns. Only ever had one issue with an order over Christmas period and customer service couldn't have been more helpful. Would, and do, recommend to anyone"
"January 10, 2019",1,Rude and incompetent customer services staff,"It would be great to see ASOS improve their consistency in the customer service. All I was looking for was a member of the ASOS team to re-arrange a delivery with their delivery provider (Gnewt), after one my packages was sent to the incorrect address which I picked by mistake. Firstly, using the online chat portal, I had to get in contact three times in one day for the following reasons:The first time (Friday 4th) it created a chat box with my old email, even though I was logged into my account with my current email. This might be a cookie refresh issue. I was told to log out and create a new ticket with my new email, even though I could fully provide any authentication on my end.The second time, having logged out and made a query passing my email in, I was told I'd get a phone call to assist me with my problem (arranging a re-delivery with Gnewt). I never got called.The third time, a few hours after I was told I'd be called, I got in contact again and received the same response, that I would be getting a phone call. I never got called.On Sunday, I then decided to get in contact with the social media CS (Facebook messenger), where my chat history is visible to read through by your team. I was told without a chat reference I could not be helped, which somewhat defeats the point in having a customer services portal on Facebook at all. When asked whether I could create a new query (and ignore the previous experiences on Friday), I was replied to with a copy-paste response of what was said before, essentially dismissing my response. It was rude, unhelpful and made me feel ignored and disrespected as a customer, especially as one paying for their next-day delivery service.Only after submitting a feedback claim that evening illustrating my frustration did I get help, which was actually solved very quickly on Monday. That was very helpful, although it made me wonder why that could not have been done first thing on Friday, rather than make me go through what I went through over the weekend. My request was not complicated, and easy to resolve, and yet it took 3 online CS staff, who knows how many Facebook Messenger CS staff and one official feedback submission to get someone on your end to action my query. This is pretty terrible on ASOS' end, and means I won't be renewing my next-day subscription as I ultimately had the experience of someone who had a delayed and problematic delivery with terrible support.The solution to my problem was not complex, and yet it took an insane amount of effort to resolve. I was unable to edit the order as the 15-minute window to edit next-day orders had elapsed by the time I realised I had picked the wrong address (ordered some other stuff to the correct address later that day). If ASOS are going to be cutting off order edits after that short window maybe I'd recommend they ensure their CS system has basic competency to handle issues like this in the future."
"January 10, 2019",5,Perfection!!!!,"I ordered a wedding suit and I was afraid of it! Quality, sizing, right color, etc. I was surprised when I got the package! Good quality, right size, and right color! Highly satisfied!!! Will order again!"
"January 10, 2019",1,Watch out!,"Watch out! If you complain about a missing item they suspend your account & charge you for your items. I received one out of three items and sent them an email and this was their reaction. No one spoke to me. All cut and paste replies with no reasoning behind their descion. Shopped with them for 6+ years with no problem and liked their service before.I‚Äôm ¬£100 out of pocket and spent the day really upset at the tone of their email (accusing me of fraud)I‚Äôve heard their doing badly financially, so think this is their way of clawing back profits - refusing to refund people.Be aware before you order."
"January 09, 2019",1,Awful delivery service and terrible customer service,"ASOS still using DPD as their delivery service and these bunch of cowboys continuely fail to deliver and lie about it. On saturday their driver decided to record a ""no one at home"" failed delivery attempt for a package for me, despite him being miles from my address. Now it is Wednesday evening and they have still failed to delivery despite me paying for 24 hour delivery. ASOS customer service is awful. copy and paste answers, and they are insisting that I have to inconvenience myself to get this sorted, despite DPD admitting in writing that their driver faked the delivery on SaturdayDPD are prepared to leave the parcel at a drop-shop for me to collect later, and reluctantly I have agreed to this, but still ASOS refuse to authorise this.

I tried this with my shirt on which left hair on it and totally ruined my shirt, returned the jacket and had to spend another ¬£60pounds on a brand new shirt because your quality of clothes ruined it. I am very disappointed and I can assure you I will not be buying from ASOS EVER AGAIN!!! I WILL BE TELLING EVERYONE OF THE BAD QUALITY OF CLOTHING YOU HAVE AND SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF FOR CHARING SO HIGH PRICES."

"January 09, 2019",1,Didn't receive my order,"Didn't receive my order. Asked for a refund was told they needed to investigate. They never got back to me. Asked 5 times. Still never gave me an answer. Asked them to refund, they said they wouldn't until they had feedback from the courier. I pointed out this breaks the law (Consumer Rights Act 2015) they have no answers it's been nearly 2 months. They've lost a customer for life, because the wouldn't refund ¬£30. Pathetic service."
"January 09, 2019",4,Give it a try!,"I bought on Jan 3 for the first time in ASOS Website. I only bought one item because I‚Äôve read poor reviews from consumers. I received my item today Jan 9 (estimated delivery is on Jan 11) in Singapore with a free standard shipping . For a cheap price item , I find it a good quality and fit true to size. So I was expecting a worsed quality or service  but so far so good. Let‚Äôs see again with my 2nd order soon."
"January 09, 2019",1,Disappointed.,"I always used ASOS and subscribed to their ASOS Premier service for next day delivery. HOWEVER. Recently, the delivery is always late, customer care is arrogant and rude and no one seems to want to help. Always the same cut and paste replies."

"January 08, 2019",5,One of my favourite websites,Definitely up there in the top retail websites for me. I‚Äôve ordered from ASOS for about 10 years now. I find their site easy to use. I‚Äôve got a premier account so it saves on my postage. They process returns much quicker than most websites.
"January 08, 2019",5,Wasn't so bad for me...,"I guess the bad part about this company is the customer service. My order was on time, right size (as ordered), looked just like the picture, it was what the description said and it was 70% off. I had it delivered to the USA and chose 2 day delivery and it got here 5 hours before scheduled. I had no issues whatsoever with this company but I would still beware if you purchase more than one item or there is a return that you have to do. Mine went off without a hitch though!"
"January 08, 2019",1,The Reps Who Say ‚ÄúMeh‚Äù,Garbage return instructions. Handed return package to mail man and apparently I needed a receipt of some sort to show proof of shipment after discovering that the package hasn‚Äôt even left the states after 2 weeks of me handing the package over. They have no serial number on these prepaid labels so my package got lost somehow due to a failure in establishing an ‚Äúactivated‚Äù shipment and I only have my name and return address to work with in attempts towards locating the thing at the Post Office. I‚Äôm sure once I locate it it will also conveniently fall beyond the return date deadline since being MIA. The reps tell me I‚Äôm SOL now and both blatantly ended the chat convos before I could gather more info.. Really disappointing turn of events so I think I‚Äôm also done with ASOS. I shouldn‚Äôt have had to experience this. Bottom line.
"January 08, 2019",2,ASOS has terrible customer service,"ASOS has terrible customer service. Or, I should say, they have terrible policies. The return policy is great if you want to return something you bought for a refund, but forget it if you want to exchange or get gift credit for something that was purchased as a gift. And worst of all, their gift cards EXPIRE. If you‚Äôre shopping from the US, it‚Äôs very difficult to use them because you have to shop in GBP rather than USD, and after two years, they expire. I lost hundreds of dollars this way."
"January 07, 2019",1,The absolute pinnacle of horrendous customer care,"The absolute pinnacle of horrendous customer service. It‚Äôs like talking to a robot, only, worse. Because with a robot you know it‚Äôs a robot so you don‚Äôt expect any genuine consideration or care.The staff are as useful as a bicycle to a fish, repetitively unhelpful, incredulously incompetent and utterly moronic. Do yourself a favour and shop absolutely anywhere else."
"January 07, 2019",5,Hassle free online buying,"I see some bad reviews on here and I'm sure not all customer experiences are as smooth as mine, I've used the company only once but it was excellent.  Good prices in the sale, swift delivery, easy return process and quick refund for the couple of items I didn't want."
"January 07, 2019",4,Never really had a problem but be aware of sizing.,"I've ordered quite a number of things from Asos over the past few years.  The most recent order was fine - was delivered early (which usually never happens and I did not pay for premier delivery) however the description of the material of the product online did not match that of the actual garment when I received it which was a bit disappointing.  Nevertheless, I still kept the product as I liked it.The clothes are not always true to size and sometimes the quality of the items aren't great but I think this is also down to the brands listed on their rather than Asos itself."
"January 07, 2019",1,"my last ever (hide and seek game) with asos, order no 380443090","Absolutely appalling service! it was my last time with this retailer. Order no 380443090, paid for the next day delivery 6 pounds extra to receive it on 4th. Waited the whole day only to find out how atrocious and cunning people working for DPD are (courier didn't arrive, later they lied about attempting to deliver). Then it was 5th that I was supposed to get my order but then again - nothing happened, no courier, tracking showed my parcel was at their depot. Spent 1h on that asos chat talking to 3 people and not only they (still) don't know when my order is going to be delivered, on top of that they're consistent at refusing to reimburse me with that 6 quid I paid extra for alleged next day delivery which turned out to be joke. Today is 7th and my parcel is still at DPD's depot."
"January 06, 2019",1,Dont buy from this company!!!!,"Dear all,Please read the review before you buy something on Asos.I bough some staff there on Nov 18.I supposed to get my staff by Dec 6 how it was said on my account.From Dec 6 i checked my post office almost every day and didn't get anything.I called them as well yesterday, nothing.Asos, you support team is terrible.They told me to wait till Dec 26.I waited.Then again wait, wait.Then i said that i needed my money back, they said check you custom office and so on....Just wasting time.Then they made their investigation and off course they were right and not responsible for anything.Guys, even when i buy some staff from China, they give my a track number even if i pay $10, i can track my order.You - nothing.No track number for free delivery.Common.....I've sent a request for charge back....People, don't buy from them.......0 stars here............"

Haha, black Friday + Christmas, please lighten up during the busy period, lol. I've purchased more than ten times with Asos in 2018. I took advantage of the next day delivery subscription + student discount code I'm still amazed by the quality and the range of products (I bought sportwear clothes, gifts, casual clothes, etc.) Love Asos, loyal customer!"
"January 05, 2019",1,Sizes are wrong,The ASOS products are getting worse. They aren‚Äôt proportional. I got a size 16 dress and on the photo it didn‚Äôt have a low cut but once I got it my size my boobs were basically hanging out. Also a size 16 girl does not have a tiny skinny back. Could barely move my arms. Thank god it was on sale. I also don‚Äôt like that you can‚Äôt review products on the app. I should be able to express what I think about each product. Won‚Äôt be ordering again. Too much risk of a product being cut wrong cause your chunky and not a skinny super model. Disgrace for the prices of products.
"January 05, 2019",1,Very poor experience - avoid ASOS,"Very poor experience. Avoid ASOS as there are so many other online retailers that provide much better experience.Returned faulty goods and ASOS refused to replace the item at the original purchase price, expecting me to repurchase at the higher sale price. Very poor service."
"January 05, 2019",1,If I could give zero stars I would,"If I could give zero stars I would! I ordered a large order from Asos.com on November 11th which I was not informed by their site that because the order was over $800 would not be eligible for their pre-paid customs which a policy that recently changed.This shipment then got stuck in customs for 10 days where I would talk to Asos on their customer service chat or email and they would tell me to talk to the shipper, UPS, but when I would call UPS they told me the paperwork was incorrect and Asos did not give them a tax ID and that Asos would need to correct the situation to get this released from customs. Asos customer service was absolutely no help whatsoever and eventually after speaking with UPS several times I was able to have them release the shipment to me by providing my personal Tax ID. THEN when the package finally arrived on 12/6 (I had paid for 2-3 day expidited shipping) UPS came to deliver the packages and would not release them to me unless I gave them my credit card to the delivery man to charge me over $1200 in duties!!! Outrageous, so I refused the order.On 12/20 it had been two weeks since I refused shipment and sent my packages back to Asos on 12/6. So I emailed their customer service to find out when I will be refunded. They told me the shipment is still in transit and it should reach their warehouse by 12/28.Now I have just emailed them again and they told me they will receive the shipment in another 14 days and that it will then take 5-10 days for refund.After many emails back and forth with customer service, which every time seemed to be a different person that did not read or understand at all the previous email communications regarding this issue they kep apologizing that I have not yet received my package and offered no help, no explanation and no shipment tracking so that I can track the package myself to see when it will arrive at their warehouse.It has now been well over 6 weeks since I placed the order and I have had no choice but to report this to my credit card company as fraud."

After contacting them asking why I was not getting a refund for the delivery, I have been informed I will get a refund for the full amount paid, why I wasn‚Äôt going to get refunded for delivery anyway I don‚Äôt know.  Customer service has really been disappointing and I‚Äôve felt as if no one I‚Äôve spoke to had cared at all. Now I‚Äôll have to buy more Christmas presents!! Won‚Äôt be buying from them again."

Ordered a pair of Ted Baker trousers for a night out and paid ¬£6 for next day delivery. As I was putting an order in anyway I chucked a pair of shoes in my basket as well. They accepted my order and sent me a dispatch notification later that evening. Ten minutes AFTER the dispatch notification they sent me a 2nd email saying the trousers, the only reason I'd made the order,  were not in stock! It then took me 3 weeks speaking to some of the rudest customer service personnel I've ever encountered, who by the way told me I couldn't speak to a supervisor or make a complaint, to eventually get a refund.I remember when their staff couldn't be more helpful, absolute joke now. Steer clear."
"January 03, 2019",2,Item never delivered!,Never had an issue with ASOS before. Really disappointed! Ordered suede shoes for my boyfriend a week before Christmas. Was told I‚Äôd get it on the 23rd December. It was late. Was then told I‚Äôd get it on New Year‚Äôs Eve. Once again nothing. Nearly two weeks later I was told to expect it soon and now today I‚Äôve been refunded as they don‚Äôt even have the item in stock! Was the item even sent out time in the first place ??? Considering this was a Christmas present as well. I could have ordered from somewhere else in enough time if I wasn‚Äôt being led on for an extra two weeks! Really disappointed! Didn‚Äôt even have a decent excuse or reason why my order didn‚Äôt turn up. Will not be ordering from here again.

"January 02, 2019",1,Use them at your peril!!!,"I can only reiterate the others. Their customer service is pathetic. Do not use this company!! If you're chatting them they will just close that chat without offering any real assistance.

They also suggested I contact the courier as they did not have the ability to do so. Shocking . It is 27 December today and I have asked for a refund as I do not want the items after having purchased a replacement gift from another store- yet ASOS is not answering my question about a refund but asking me to wait. Appalling that they have taken my money and the goods are not to be seen. I will not be shopping with ASOS again and will be taking this to the consumer ombudsman if my refund is not forthcoming.

I have an email chain 26 emails long relating to 3 orders that have been lost. 1 from the 5th December is still outstanding and customer services via email are repetitive and scripted giving no helpful information. Multiple requests to be called were ignored. The best that they can do is contact dpd again. The call centre are also on a script which makes dealing with them so frustrating. I do not even want the order anymore yet I‚Äôm expected to wait for dpd and ASOS to do an investigation which the result will no doubt be its lost.

DO NOT ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE!!!,"i ordered a pair of men's shoes for my son on black friday with an estimated delivery of approx. 5 business days. i received a notice that due to an airport delay, it would arrive about 3 days later.  The item i ordered was for Christmas, so it wasn't too big a deal.  When the item arrived, the shoes were damage (scratched) and dented.  i took photos of the item and started a chat with them because you can NEVER speak with a person. There is no phone number you can call to actually speak to a person! So they said they would send me out the correct pair and i could pay myself to return them and at some point would reimburse me for the shipping, What?  Just send me a return label! I am not going out of pocket to return your damaged item. So when the other shoe arrived, it was totally the wrong shoe.  it didn't even look like the shoe i ordered! Of course, i had to go back on chat and tell them of the situation.  I also took photos of the wrong shoe for them to review.  Now by this time its crunch time for christmas, so they told me there was nothing more they can do for me except to refund me the amount of the original purchase.  so i politely asked (on chat) what about the shoe i need for Christmas, are you going to send me the correct undamaged shoe that i have been waiting on?  I told them i would gladly return the ones they sent. i was instructed that i would have to pay again for the shoe i had already paid for and they would refund me once they receive the damaged one back. Wait, so i am paying twice and i still don't have what i ordered and of course they said it would not arrive in time for Christmas because yeah, you guys don't know how to process orders properly! Needless to say, i am putting these back in the mail and i told my son i would NEVER order anything else from this vile company.  i only gave it one star because i couldn't give it a zero.  Please keep your money from this scam company with no customer service!! VERY ANGRY CUSTOMER!!!"
"mber 26, 2018",1,Gift did not arrive on time - no compensation,"I ordered a gift on December 16, paid $4 for shipping and it said it would arrive by Christmas eve. Late Christmas evening when it hadn't arrived, I contacted customer service being chat (as it is the only way to contact them) and was promised it would arrive by 10 PM or something could be done to compensate me. It did not arrive. I contacted customer service again and they told me to allow until JANUARY 7 for it to arrive. They would not even refund my delivery charge, and Christmas was ruined for my brother who did not receive a gift due to this error.Additionally, the track order link did not provide any information from my order. Amesha at customer service did give me the tracking information, but it wasn't available to me at the link provided. Their forecast delivery time was hugely optimistic to get here from Spain, as they sent it through the USPS normal mail.I will not buy from ASOS again, and I recommend expecting a very long delivery time if you do. From other reviews it appears paying more for faster shipping did nothing.Absolute joke."

I have probably ordered about 100 items from them over the years, and have experienced problems on 1 or 2 occasions. Considering the amount of orders they process, it is naive to expect them to get it right every single time- unless you'd prefer humans removed and computers doing all the work instead?!GREAT company, wouldn't hesistate to recommend them for a second."

I personally plan to open a case in police against @ASOS, it is really out of control.  No money, no items, no tracking number, no follow up. They just don't care."

The parcel has been lost by Hermes but ASOS have not got anyway to assist other than let Hermes try and find it by giving them an additional week to deliver. The parcel was flaggeg on Hermes site as needing additional 24 hrs on the 19th, still not here. I have had to take this up with Hermes while ASOS sit on my payment. My contract was with ASOS not Hermes but I'm left taking the time to deal with a missing item. First and last time I'll use them."

I ordered a dress for two holiday parties (my office party and my boyfriends). I ordered the dress on 11/30 and added $100 shoes to qualify for 2 day shipping. I didn't receive the dress for my boyfriend's work party and mine is tomorrow. It is now 14 days later and after three inquiry emails that were never responded to, I finally tried the live chat. Even though I was as polite as possible, Aliyah was short with me acting like it was my fault for not being patient and then when I asked ""so there is nothing you can do to help?"" She responded with ""We need to allow time for delays Ellie"" and ended the chat. Unbelievable!"

Disgusting considering I've ordered over a week before Christmas as a gift.Found the customer service to be rude and unwilling to refund me at least my delivery charges but doubt I will get anything! If they were genuine they'd have stated on their website that delivery in time for Christmas was not guaranteed. Really disappointed and won't be buying from them ever again.Order number 376914986"

At first the customer care was really good and once all proof provided, which I always keep, refunds were adjusted. Just having trouble at the moment with one refund..  they just don't seem to grasp the fact that they have under refunded me.SO BE AWARE ALWAYS TAKE COPIES OF YOUR PROOF OF POSTAGE AND THE RETURN FORM AS BELIEVE ME IF YOU GET A CORRECT REFUND IT IS A MIRACLE.I love there clothes and this returns department really needs feedback forwarded onto them.....normally the customer care team are also good but I am still going back and forward to them regarding this one order.  I have wasted hours sending emails over the last few months and not once have they offered me any gesture of goodwill.Lucky to get 1 star."

I remonstrated with them several times, but they were unbelievably slippery. I asked for a refund so I could replace the presents from elsewhere, which was refused. Completely unsatisfactory, have never had a situation like this before. Never, ever again."

"mber 22, 2018",1,Constant disappointment!,Constant disappointment! Always seem to get the wrong item delivered. They have an exchange option on the form but it doesn‚Äôt actually exist.

Daughter said no, so foolishly ordered off ASOS.Have annual subscription so came next day.Waited till she was open to open.  Wasn't happy at state of outer box (not main delivery box, but a small white one inside), but as solid MK box inside this, was happy enough.  Opened box to see what this ¬£150 watch looked like and...nothing.  There was an instruction manual and the felt thing the watch sits on but some thief at the ASOS warehouse had successfully stolen the watch.Ok these things happen.  Really not happy but they happen.  Phoned 0207 756 1000 (for anyone else who wants to speak to someone) and was told they couldn't issue a replacement or refund until they had received the item (an empty box) back!  Demanded a manager callback, assured within 24 hours.  As surely proof I had sent the item back (CollectPlus) would be enough for them to issue a replacement.Multiple DMs on Twitter, where they asked what had happened and for proof I had sent back, etc, all supplied (including photo of empty box, packaging, ect)...Next day, another script monkey ignores what had gone on the night before and spewed the 7 day investigation, further 5 days for refund... and to be fair, lost it at this point!  It was when they said missing item and then as I had received the incorrect item!Was told if I swear again they won't help!  It doesn't actually matter that they weren't helping, just clutching at straws to pretend it was my fault!So in mid afternoon, called back again...Today's lie was timescale has gone from 24 hrs to 48 hrs!  Requested he go and check.  Tried to refuse.  Demanded he check that I was getting the callback that was agreed, came back and said no!  So item stolen by staff, lied to by CS and managers who apparently don't care one way or the other.  Sadly only thing making me feel slightly better, is reading everyone else's horror stories as at least it's not just me!"
"mber 22, 2018",1,Don't waste your time,"Honestly some of the worst customer services I've had. Bought a pair of shoes expecting them to be here by Christmas as a gift. They arrived all right, with one shoe in the box! I contact them, explaining my situation and all they tell me to do is send them back. No offer to fix their mistake, but instead make an excuse that they're sold out (which they were not, since I had to shell out another 53 bucks to buy another pair), and that they cannot send them. I instead suggest compensation, maybe free two-day, something that will guarantee I get my order when I was SUPPOSED to. Nope. They say it can't be done, no explanation or willingness to make right on their shortcomings. Now I'm waiting until January sometime. I'll never buy anything from here again.ps: I ordered ONE item.

It's the worst customer service I've ever had, and I'm just a student, and I want them to give me back my money. That's my living expenses. my order number at ASOS is 370637034"
"mber 22, 2018",1,Scammers - Run!,"Scammers - ASOS is just like the shipping company they associate themselves with - DHL. Incompetence and a complete disregard to what me, the costumer, had to say. Asos online-chat staff, Gabrielle, tells me for 15 full minutes that my order was ‚Äúattempted delivery‚Äù on Dec 21 but because the driver didn‚Äôt find me home, they now need to attempt again. And if I‚Äôm not receiving the goods by January 4th than I can get In touch with asos again. Until then, my Christmas presents are obviously not deleivered, and I‚Äôve wasted more time trying to come to a solution with these two incompetent and scamming businesses. I have no idea how they stay in business. This is the second time this happened to me. Asos and DHL both sell me a product t they can‚Äôt stand by- express shipping. I sigh the online waiver for signature release to leave my package at front door, while I am also home but I never get any DHL driver coming by because this is what they do. They lie that they drove around and didn‚Äôt find the client home. Asos online chat Gabrielle goes on to tell me that perhaps the driver didn‚Äôt deem it safe enough to leave the package at the front door....I feel completely insulted! It doesn‚Äôt matter if I live in the ghettos or if I live in the 2 million dollar house, as long as I signed the waiver Asos, let me the costumer make that decision! Whether is safe or not to leave my packages at the front door. Gabrielle‚Äôs response on deeming safe made insulted me and made me laugh at the same time. Purely incompetent, a loss of my time and money, no manager they could escalate this issue to, and their support consists of copy/paste of b-s policy every other two minutes when I keep insisting that I feel duped by them both , Asos and DHL. I have an email of the transcript conversation with this person at Asos and i‚Äôll Make sure to post my review on every site on every continent for both Asos  and DHL. Asos and DHL CEO‚Äôs do you even read your costumers‚Äô reviews on your companies?

"mber 22, 2018",4,I actually love ASOS,"I actually love ASOS. The best variety of cloth and accessories. I only once had delay with shipping,for one day,but that was not a big deal.  I like that they have prepaid labels to return,no problems with refunds. You need to make sure what kinda brands you are buying ,cause some of them (pretty little thing) have the worst quality. I am able to buy cloth that is not available in US so I am very happy about it."
"mber 21, 2018",1,ASOS is the 2018 Joke,"I fists order 13 items on the 25th of November (most of my X-mas gifts) that were supposed to arrive on the 5th December.When I did not receive any order I contacted ASOS that told me that I should wait until the 12th December. By that date no order had arrived and when I contacted again, they told me I should check with the local post office and customs... When I questioned this information because I did not have any tracking number.. they finally told me that the order did not even left the warehouse.They refunded me, and after I asked for the correct email so I could do a formal complaint they end up sending me a promotion code so I could buy the same things at the same price.The second time around, I placed the order and paid extra to be delivered on the 18th December.... well... nothing arrived.After 4 emails and a IM I was told that they were fixing the problem and that I should receive an email (so I could get the order before X-mas). 3 days later, I receive an email stating that they would refund me because there was an issue with order...2 days before X-mas and I dont have the presents I bought and not even an apology... what a joke.. For me ASOS is on the scam list of online shopping."
"mber 21, 2018",1,Terrible Customer Service,"History: Ordered Christmas gifts on 15th Dec, delivery scheduled for 17th Dec. Received email on 16th advising the order had been dispatched.

Couple hours later received email stating ‚Äúwe‚Äôve received your returned items‚Äù. Followed up again with the team and was told various different stories ‚Äúitems were out of stock‚Äù, ‚Äúorder couldnt be found in the warehouse‚Äù etc etc funnily enough a simple click back onto the website showed the items were in stock however funnily enough they had reverted back to their original prices (surprise surprise). Asked on multiple occasions for the matter to be escalated - however it seems apparently Asos do not have a dedicated complaints / escalations team as the Customer Care team handle such matters - this is questionable.Conclusion: The Customer Care team require training on what it actually means to ‚Äúcare‚Äù for customers. Also honesty is always the best policy."
"mber 21, 2018",1,I am very unhappy with all the lies‚Ä¶ Christmas Gifts Not coming,"I am very unhappy with the level of service that I have received from ASOS and DPD, so I will review for both, I share this with you as I have just been sent an email from ASOS with lies. I will inform you of what I have so far experienced.I ordered Christmas gifts for my daughter from ASOS and designated my click and collect location. I am a Police Office working for the MET so I am limited on time due to dealing with criminals so click and collect is the obvious choice. Clearly not the case.After dealing with my arrest and case papers I Headed over to My click and collect location, as I received a message saying it had been signed for. However it was not there and was never sent there.After spending an age on the phone trying to get through to customer service I found out that the package is in BARKING ( WHY?) so I said I would collect it. I was then told that I could not as my name is not on the packages, DPD saying ASOS messed up. (was that also a lie? Was it even there?). Even though the  lady I spoke too was looking at my details on a computer screen knowing what my name is along with the reference number that is on the screen in front of her I would not be able to collect it.  Time out.........Logic, initiative, common sense, think outside the box........ Put my name on the box..... Screen in front says my name. I ordered it. It is for the said name on the screen. I am that person, get a pen and put my name on the package........... The Ref number is on the screen  and is linked to my name. Ok Logic is gone from this world. Too much time on phones, who knows turning into mindless robots.Long story short Dpd blame ASOS, ASOS blame DPD. I don't like playing the blame game, why don't they just talk to each other. As I was dealing with a Policing matter so I asked the lady from DPD nicely and calmly for her to email me with a solution as all I want to do is pick up my xmas gift for my daughter. She said she would email me at the email address that she had... and guess what?  yes under my name,I thanked her for her help, did she email me back that day? No. They are still blaming each other and not one has come up with a solution. I do not recommend ASOS or DPD."

Support suggested I consult sizing chart as if it was my mistake and it was them mixing up UK and US sizes...ridiculous! Webpage, support - no help. Pointlessly waited for some dpt's response for 3 days re mistake... Eventually they've sent me a replacement order without my consent. And withheld money for the replacement item they've sent even when I've returned the pair I've initially received! All in all 2 months before I get my money back for a wrong sized pair!!! First and surely last time purchasing from them."
"mber 21, 2018",1,Hi am from mauritius,Hi am from mauritius. I had purchased several times on ASOS. But this will be the last time. I purchased one month ago and one of my order came with the wrong shoes size where on the box the size was correct. On a different order I brought a watches and when I received my parcel in mauritius it was empty. Only the ASOS box and the return policy paper was inside. Am very disappointed when u call or send mail they told u that they will look into and will refund but the refund never came. The watches I brought is amounting to 95gbp. Bad customer service
"mber 21, 2018",5,Not really understanding the negativity,"I normally don't review websites I buy products from but looking at the volume of negativity that is completely opposite to my personal experience I feel like I should, not to say I think anybody is making up their experience, I am sure a lot of these negative reviews do have some credence but I have never experienced anything like that from ASOS. For example, I purchased a bag Wednesday evening using standard delivery (19th December) it has just arrived 5 minutes ago (21st December) so it would appear the delivery is very hit or miss as I am seeing volumes of people saying their order hasn't been dispatched 10 days after purchase.Overall in the 3 to 4 times I have used ASOS they have yet to disappoint me as they offer some of the best (if not the best) prices in the market, only thing I would say I do find mildly concerning is that the delivery (at least for standard) is by MyHermes and while they have done superbly the last 4 times, to say I have had a bumpy ride with them in the past would be an understatement so please do be cautious."
"mber 21, 2018",1,Worst experience ever!!!,"Worst experience ever!!!! Ordered shoes in size 39, they send me the shoes in size 40 and don't agree to replace!! Every time saying different reasons for over two weeks. In the end, I suggested that I keep the bigger size but need compensation for the insoles.

"mber 21, 2018",2,Poor customer service,"I have ordered from Asos for years and never had a problem, but my most recent experiences with the company have been so bad that I had to write this review. I am a firm believer that - when something goes wrong you find out how good a company truly is.When my parcel didn't arrive I contacted Asos and was told my parcel had never left the warehouse. They said that they would replace my order or if the items were out of stock, provide a refund. A few days later a received an email stating that the items were out of stock so I would get a refund in 5-7 days. The next morning both items were in stock, however, they were no longer half price as they were when I ordered them some days before, they were now full price. Once again I called customer service, the advisor was rude and did not offer a solution, but instead said 'there is nothing we can do, I'm sorry"". When I asked to speak to a manager, I was told I would have to send an email in, I was adamant that I wanted to speak to someone and in the end, was offered a 24-48 hour call back. I have not received a callback and don't think I will. I will order from elsewhere in future."

"mber 20, 2018",1,Owed ¬£850!! Appalling customer service,"So stressed with ASOS! I've had years of positive shopping experiences with them but lately, for some reason, they have been a nightmare! No returns notes included in the parcels, incorrect refund amounts and what's worse is I am currently owed a total of ¬£850 in refunds (from 3 orders) which should have been issued at the start of November! This is obviously the worst time of year that they could possibly mess me about and I am so stressed from emailing and receiving copied and pasted responses! I was made to provide them with statements evidenting 20 days after the date that each refund was processed so had to wait almost a month to get my monthly statement as Halifax wouldn't provide a statement mid term. I've provided this and now all I keep getting is a request for my November statement (sent 3 times already!) and screen shots to show that they have processed the refund. Seriously?! Give me strength!!!"

IT TOOK 3 WEEKS FOR ME TO GET A RESOLUTION, INITIALLY THEY WERE STATING THEY HAD DELIVERED IT. I SEARCHED ONLINE AND COULD SEE THIS WAS A COMMON THING, SOMEONE IS PICKING THE EXPENSIVE ITEMS AND NICKING EM!!!!

I emailed them this morning and they are now saying I won‚Äôt get my package until the 27th (after Christmas) it should not take 17 days to get a package... I would have never bought from this website if I knew this is how it would be. Don‚Äôt shop here if you want your items by a certain time!!!"
"mber 20, 2018",1,Bought 10th Dec - in stock - Might deliver sometime in January...,"Bought a Christmas gift on Dec 10th for my Dad. Chased it a week later and tracking said that Hermes were still waiting for it. In my experience working with parcel networks this item is lost so I called and asked them to send a replacement. They told me they can't and won't do anything until 7 working days. This apparently works out that they won't take an action until the 24th Dec. As they're busy, they said it would also take 5-8 days to reprocess/deliver the reorder (a Christmas gift). Requested to cancel the order, as a Christmas gift on 2nd Jan is about as useful as a prophylactic sheath on a maternity ward. Conveniently they also can't cancel an order until 7 working days afterwards. Am now looking forwards to either cancelling the order or returning the item. Shocking festive experience.EDIT: Called on Christmas Eve as directed, told that they couldn't do anything until the end of the day at 10pm - advised to call bak on Boxing day.Called on Boxing day, jumper was delivered on 27th Dec. Gave to my Dad as a 2nd present, he likes the jumper.Slightly improved date, but review stays at 1* because I was messed around so much by customer services and the experience was poor, albeit nice clothing eventually received."
"mber 20, 2018",1,The worst company in the UK,"The worst company I have ever dealt with. They took my money, didn‚Äôt deliver my order. Cancelled my order without informing me. Then kept the money. I had to go through my bank and raise a claim with Visa to get it back, and ASOS disputed it. They stole ¬£200. I got it back, but it took 4 weeks.Their customer service reps are absolutely useless and do not give a damn. They have no power to do anything. I do not have time to write everything that happened to me, but it ended in my requesting that all of my data be deleted under the GDPR act. This company is rotten and should not be allowed to treat its customers thus way."
"mber 20, 2018",1,Unwilling to help despite several order issues,"I have spoken with two customer reps regarding an order in the past two days but they have been unable to resolve my issues.I originally ordered an item during the sale where it was ¬£72.00 not ¬£90.I ordered a size 14, but a size 16 arrived so I exchanged it for a 14. This was still far too big, so I sent back the 14 and ordered a 12. I am keeping the 12 as it was the only one that fit of the coats, and I did not want to go through the hassle of sending it back again so close to Christmas, despite the fact that it arrived missing a button and someone had sewn the collar to the coat so it was not in appropriate condition for sale at full price. I forgot to add my student discount to this order and was told that:- I could not have my discount added retrospectively- I could not receive a refund of the sale price difference (¬£18.00) despite originally ordering the item when it was on sale, because instead of ticking ""exchange"" on the form for the return of the size 14 coat, I simply sent it back as a return and ordered a 12 separately.I think that it would be reasonable on this occasion to refund the difference as I requested, since I effectively did exchange the coat, not refund it, and honour my student discount since there have been several issues with this purchase.I would like to be able to say that I received great service from Asos as this has always been the case in the past, but on this occasion I feel let down.Since the customer service reps on the online chat have been unable to help, I have sent a formal complaint.I would appreciate it if I could receive my discounts to resolve the issue once and for all."

"mber 19, 2018",2,Disappointed,"I‚Äôve been using ASOS for years now and did not have any issues until recently. I ordered two jackets and boots and decided i didn‚Äôt like any of them and returned them. I sent the jacket out first via royal mail, and the boots and second jacket via Hermes a couple days later. My royal mail package had arrived at their depot a while ago but there was no confirmation of a refund, and by this time I had already recieved my Hermes refund. I decided to contact customer services via twitter (Do not contact them on ANY online platform as they will reply with the same automated message that they are ‚Äòlooking into it‚Äô) they were no help at all, I did the same with the live chat and spoke to around 4 different people and no one could tell me whats going on. I then found a number for asos and called them up and they told me theyd refer my issue to the specialist team and I would just have to send a picture of the proof of my royal mail receipt. Thankfully I still kept it! I was sceptical though, but I have just recieved an email from their team to confirm my refund of the jacket. It was a tiresome and long experience and I‚Äôm disappointed in them but glad I‚Äôve got my ¬£160 back. Next time I‚Äôll definitely pay with paypal!"

ASOS should be responsible enough to account for their own mistake and learn to improve what they had not done right to be make themselves an even better company? BUT NO. I ordered my VANS SLIDE from this website, it states that I CAN RECEIVE IT ON 13NOVEMBER. NO DID NOT. then I contact the customer service to asked about my item status. They replied me that they will be making a replacement which will come on 21NOVEMBER, so I waited. GUESS WHAT ; back to checking the letterbox like a moron AGAIN for NOTHING. so I couldn‚Äôt tolerate anymore and requested to CANCEL MY ORDER AND REFUND MY FREAKING MONEY. they didn‚Äôt want to and referred me to their ‚Äú SPECIALIST TEAM‚Äù to clear their üí© up. And so their specialist team agreed to refund. The worse thing is, I ordered this vans slide as a gift for my Boyfriend to surprise him yet thisss  happens. Honestly ASOS can u buck up and use ur time to correct all these delivery process and make sure to have a credible delivery company and keep to your promise by providing updates constantly instead of spending ur time to serve the customers for their problem ??? asos I don‚Äôt get u"

"mber 19, 2018",1,READ THIS BEFORE YOU ORDER WITH THIS COMPANY,"I have NEVER in my entire life written an online review but my experience with this company made me do it.  This company is terrible. I ordered two items Thanksgiving weekend. They were scheduled to arrive on December 3rd but didn't. When I contacted them they said they'd arrive on the 5th. Some problem with a delayed flight they said. It didn't arrive on the 5th. Now they said the 13th. Guess what? Didn't arrive. Now it was going to be the 15th. Nope! It finally came late afternoon on December 17th. On December 18th they sent me an email that they had mailed a replacement order as I had requested. 1. I never ordered a replacement order2. Couldn't they tell from tracking that it had now arrived?So, I wrapped the gifts and gave them out and very kindly I emailed them to let them know the original package had arrived. They responded that my new package would arrive December 21st and I was to return the original package.1. Raise your hand if you believe them that the package will arrive on December 212.  I don't have the originals in my possession. Do I ask for them back?I must package it up, go to a library to print out the label, and package it back up. WAIT!! When does your stupidity become my problem??"

I have never had a negative experience and have used ASOS since 2002. I feel that as long as you read their descriptions of clothing (material, sizing, etc) you will get what you have paid for. I also like the ¬£9.99 a year next day delivery option. Still the first online store I visit."
"mber 19, 2018",2,Customer Service? What customer service?,"I am an avid Asos shopper and spend way too much money on their website. Usually the service is pretty good and the delivery is when it says it is and i often do not have many issues. I have had the odd miss hap but now it has happened one too many times for me to just let it go. Usually when you have an issue it is the worst customer service i ever experience and my issue 100% never gets resolved, its either stick with what you got or send it back for a refund. I recently bought a present on there and received a completely different design to the one shown on the website. I raised this issue to be sent the same incorrect shoe again... (this is not the first time this problem has happened either). I actually really wanted the shoe that i bought and paid for but no one could give me an explanation as to why they are sending a completely different design (common sense would say that they have used the wrong imagery but no the same image is still sat there 2 weeks after i raised this issue). Also the customer service team is pointless as they aren't even the ones to even sort out the issue, its a 'Specialist team. All customer services do is give you a time frame to wait. The first time i contacted ASOS it was 3 days, and then the second it was 5 days and then the third time, another 8 DAYS TO WAIT FOR A RESPONSE. Absolute joke. I didn't even get a token of good will to keep my loyal custom after they made the mistake TWICE. Whether this is a blessing in disguise as i will not be purchasing from them any time soon!"

They try to make me feel like im stupid and I order wrong size but once I sent screen shots of my order they felt salty and close chat and left me hanging. I been Facebook chatting with them and so far I spoken to Lee, Dean, Torchi, Will, Salmon and Natasha.

"mber 18, 2018",2,These guys are rubbish,"These guys are rubbish! Like, yeah, they have loads of stuff in stock and you can buy pretty much anything from them. However, actually receiving your items once purchased is waaaay too difficult. They use terrible couriers and almost never deliver things on time. And even if you pay for next day delivery, they'll use DHL who will try and deliver something at around 7pm, which is rubbish for a next day delivery if you're having it delivered to an office of place of work. Oh, and you might get the wrong order and have to go through the painstaking process of returning an item. Yay! Good luck with that.

Then contacted ASOS to ask for a refund on delivery as 6.95 for something that didn't happen is appaulling.  No response apart from an automated email again. Got online again only to be told it needs to go to specialist team for review, well it's clearly obvious you didn't deliver so what's the deal! Told it will take 5 days and I will be contacted, 7 days later still no response. Then emailed again to be told it will take another 8 days, really.

I asked to speak to a manager about the delayed parcel and the chat lady just simply closed the chat without giving useful help. That was the worst and most rude service i have ever received. Don't buy from them if you are looking for Christmas present."

I sent another email today and received an email from hahahahaha (very weird return email address) advising that they are busy and that my delivery is on the way (email was very poor English so I hope I read this correctly).

Completely patronising and indifferent.They do not care that it will be delivered to the wrong address. Won't cancel order even though it was placed less then 2 hours ago. Asked me to place a new order with them and if I didn't have the funds that I could pay it off. Completely unbelievable, I have never had such a poor response from any online purchase. Will never buy from them again."

"mber 15, 2018",1,I used to love Asos... NO MORE - TRAGIC customer service,"I used to love Asos... not any more... this is the second time in less than two months that I had problems with my delivery. I order a number of Xmas gifts on 10 December, estimated delivery was for the 14th. I could see from the tracking number on the 14 that it would not arrive however, when you contact Asos, instead of checking with the courier they ask you to wait until the end of the day. So I contacted them again (on facebook) at the end of the day. The new estimation was the 20th, their courier's estimation was the 19th...their customer service estimation via email is the 25th and their exact words were: ""It states the parcel is in transit with the destination country so If they have said that it will arrive on the 19th then please go with this estimate"" which means that they have absolutely no idea what is going on!!!! And they always say ""I understand these were Christmas gifts"". I guess WERE is the key word here since they cannot be Christmas Gifts if they don't arrive before Xmas. Also, are they joking recommending there will be a delivery on Xmas day? This was their latest response:""I've checked this for you, and due to a delay with our carrier, please allow until the end of the day on the 25th of December 2018 at latest for your order to be delivered.""WHAT A JOKE! Last time I had to escalate this issue with an external party and this is when they remembered to solve my issue. ASOS what a shame you used to be a great shopping experience..."

"mber 14, 2018",1,If I could give them 0 Stars I would,"If I could give them 0 Stars I would. Customer Service is awful. They do not care about their customers. I ordered 2 things about a week ago even though I‚Äôm paying for Premier Delivery. I‚Äôve never had any problems with them before but I will never order from them again. They don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs going on, There is obviously no communication within this company, I had one guy online lie to me saying it had been dispatched when it hadn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve told them I don‚Äôt want my order anymore. They just give generic Answers. I would highly avoid. All signs of a bad Company, That doesn‚Äôt care about its Customers"

They the offered to send a new one and it would be there with in 5 days. 2 weeks later and it‚Äôs still not here so my daughter had to go with out one . I then email again to ask where it was and they forget to send me one and the product was out of stock.

"mber 14, 2018",1,If i  could give them no stars I would,If i  could give them no stars I would. Ive been a frequent customer on Asos and never knew they did not have a customer service line to call. For such a large company youd think theyd have a number for you to speak to someone. ANYWAYS... my package was mailed out on December 4th (I paid for two day shipping) I check and my package was supposed to be delivered on December 11th. Now I go to try and track it and there is absolutely no information available. I have contacted them on both Facebook and Email and each time someone new comes back with the same message that was sent by the previous person. Ive given my email address and account information and have sent screenshots on my account information and they continue to tell me I am not the account holder......I will be getting the police involved in their little scam.

Our order was due yesterday and all they can tell me to to contact them post Christmas if it hasn't arrived by end of 24 Dec!  No confidence it will arrive!
"mber 14, 2018",1,Awful,"Awful, awful, awful customer service. Ordered an item this month and have premier delivery. However it did not arrive next day, or the day after or the day after that and so on. So I contacted customer services to see where the parcel was as there was no info forthcoming from the delivery company. I was cut off first time I tried to find out what was happening. I tried again and was given the same rhetoric over and over, wait another 5 days and see what happens. That‚Äôs it. No apology, I can‚Äôt cancel, I can‚Äôt get my money back, they won‚Äôt contact the delivery company to see where my parcel is or why the item I have paid for has not gotten to me. Actually, I found them quite impolite and impossible. I asked to speak to a manager and was blocked. The message I‚Äôm getting is that they don‚Äôt give a damn whether they provide a decent service, whether I get my items, or whether they have taken my money without supplying the goods. This has put me right off of ever using them again. Shocking and very disappointing really for such a big company."
"mber 14, 2018",1,Sort yourselves out ASOS,The previous reviewer (Liz) summed it up. I could simply cut and paste her complaint as mine her rhetoric more or less mirrors mine. I sincerely hope that our honest reviews steer potential customers away from ASOS and exposes how shabbily they treat their customers. I have never encountered a company with such a pathetic ambivalence towards it's customers. Trustpilot tells the world that 58% of 5622 people who have sent a review in are unhappy with your service. That means you have lost more than 3000 customers because of your failed processes and arrogance. Sort yourselves out.
"mber 14, 2018",1,worst customers service and return,"I ordered a pair of pants and the first time I had them on the sewing went up on the left thigh, so I contacted the customer service and the live chat and I said up to 4 times that I just wanted my money back and then they said I would have to wait up to five days to get a answer back, so today I received a mail where there stood that I would receive and replacement, but that was not what I asked for. I contacted the live chat again and requested that this was cancelled and I got my refund as I requested several times. I also sent screenshots of the mail and I couldn't get my money back, because the trousers where processed already - so now I have to wait 1 week to receive the trousers, then I have to wait 1 week again to return the pants and then I have to wait 1 week again before I finally receive my money. So I have to wait 3 weeks now to get my money back, because of a fail from ASOS side and they didn't even do anything to help me."
"mber 14, 2018",1,Appalling Customer service,I ordered an item from asos on the 1st of December and I have premier delivery which means I have paid for a years worth of next day delivery. The next day the item didnt arrive. I waited two futher days nothing came. I then spoke to asos on their chatline where I was told i had to wait a further 5 days. I spoke to them again on that day and was yet again told to wait a few more days. By now the item i ordered which was for some interviews isnt really needed. I have just spoke to them again and they said they will now pass it onto a specialist team but id have to wait a further 48hours to know anything. I was fed up of waiting around and chasing them about the order so I asked to have a full refund and said to forget sending it now. I was them told id be updated abot a possible refund after the specialist team had looked into it. So no refund no nearer to finding out where it was than a week ago. I asked to make a formal complaint and was refused. I have been a customer with asos for many years and use them fairly regulary but clearly they do not value their customers I am extremely annoyed by the customer service I have recieved I understand its a busy time of year and would have been fine if they had emailed me to say theres been a delay or it wasnt possible to deliver next day at the moment instead they made me chase it up repeatedly and brushed off any complaint i tried to make

"mber 14, 2018",1,Have any of you been cheated by this‚Ä¶,"Have any of you been cheated by this website? I have been cheated, fooled. I made my order by the end of November and received my Dispatch confirmation email on December 1st. One week after, while checking the tracking I realized that it was not moving at all, and still showing ''processing''. I started to contact customer service using messenger and spoke with 3 different agents. All of them were talking about some duties payments that were pending to pay so that my order could be released from customs. Apparently, you will be able to create your order on ASOS and paid the amount that you agreed and on top of that, after your order is confirmed and when you cannot cancel anymore, they will send you a second email informing you about some customs duties to pay. In my case, I never received the supposed email and that's why the order show still processing. I wonder what happens if Clients don't pay these HIDDEN DUTIES. Will ASOS receive back the package and keep the Clients money? - I totally believe this is the case, as they already said that the order cannot be canceled.To all my friends, please avoid using ASOS so that you don't be fooled or cheated. They will make you pay a specific amount, later on, ask you for more money to release the package and if by any chance you never receive that notification, that means that you will never receive nor your package nor your money back."
"mber 14, 2018",1,Criminal enterprise.,"Horrible. Package came 10 days late. Event is long over with. During the delay ASOS refused a refund or any compensation for an almost two week delay past the delivery date THEY represented. Rude and nasty customer service reps. Say things like ‚Äúit‚Äôs not our fault‚Äù asked for manager and was told that managers don‚Äôt speak to customers. What? Pushed the issue, they said one would call me in 24-48 hours. Absolutely did not receive a call. This place is a total scam. Steer clear. Don‚Äôt do it to yourself."
"mber 13, 2018",2,Ordered 20+ times,"Ordered 20+ times, never had an issue.... BUT their express shipping service is beyond terrible. I remember a year or so ago ordinary shipments (non-express) would sometimes come in 5 days from the UK > Australia which was amazing. However, the 3 times I've used the express service (and foregone other discounts to use the AUEXPRESS code) it has taken over a week to come. When I ordered this time it said 'Delivery by Friday'... well it's Friday and it hasn't even landed in Australia yet. Super annoying and a waste of money I could have saved."

"mber 13, 2018",1,Horrible customer service - will never be ordering with them again,"Ordered a jacket on Nov 26. ASOS informed me it would be late so they refunded my shipping fee. Was supposed to be deliver Dec 6 - it is now December 13 & still have not receive the jacket. When I reach out via email with support they just keep pushing the receiving date back. First it was if you don't receive by Dec 12 please reach to us. Now since I have not received it, I'm being told there is an issue with the delivery service and if I don't receive it by December 17th to email them again. Will NEVER be ordering with this company again."

"mber 13, 2018",1,Disgusting customer service... really disappointed,"I have been ordering off ASOS for years and have never had a problem prior to now. I have waited two weeks for my order, have contacted them several times through their live chat - only to be told that my issue will be forwarded to a 'specialist team'. I have just received a refund  which I didn't ask for - I wanted the goods I ordered - without any explanation as to why my parcel hasn't arrive and without the choice of a refund. I am disgusted by this service. The goods I ordered were presents. The least I could receive is an explanation and an apology."
"mber 13, 2018",5,Never had any issues with my orders‚Ä¶,Never had any issues with my orders everything was brilliant. It‚Äôs the Christmas season and businesses like Asos have a huge influx of orders. Suffice to say my order went missing when Hermes was processing it. Asos were fantastic they dealt with the problem swift and within days has issued me with a replacement order which was delivered next day. I am extremely happy with how my issue was dealt. Will continue to shop with Asos highly recommend.
"mber 13, 2018",1,So disappointed!,"I've been a loyal customer of Asos for years. They've probably made a fortune off me but this time I've been so disappointed in their customer service. Ordered a package on 25th November - it is now 13th December and it's still not here. While the issue lies with the courier, Collect+ (and I have contacted them separately), Asos have done very little to reassure me. Their customer service reps on social media provide generic responses and say they have contacted Collect+ and haven't received a response.  I have contacted them myself and have received numerous responses leading me to believe they haven't made much of an effort at their end. My order contained outfits for Christmas parties and also gifts which have now sold out online. I am so disappointed and won't be using Asos again.Also, their loyalty programme was fab but has since been scrapped which is disappointing. There is no incentive for being a loyal customer."
"mber 13, 2018",1,Worst experience ever!!!,Worst experience ever!!!! Ordered an item in November to be able to take pictures and have yet to receive the item. There is only chat or email if you want to reach customer service and I chatted in two times and got told two different dates about when I will receive the item. BEWARE!!!
"mber 13, 2018",1,I would have given them negative stars,"I would have given them a negative 5 star if I had the choice. I created this account simply because I felt I need to write down my extremely frustrating experience with ASOS so less people will have to go through this. They are so outdated and slow in terms of processing any return. Don't ever expect they update you on time when you ship your return stuff back. The worst of the worst, ASOS absolutely doesn't give a sh** about their customer even though plus the quality of the stuff they sale is extremely bad and looks nothing like the picture (At least try impress your customer at one thing). Usually companies have a number to call or an effective online chat system. But guess what ASOS has? No direct number and an online chat system where on one talks to you. I'm shocked that their customer representatives would just completely ignore me on online chat and kept me waiting for 30min. After I gone really upset about their attitude, they sent me an email telling me it was a ""technical issue"". (Oh really? you couldn't send me this email right away). Not only they don't care, but also they LIE and makes up false excuse to make you go away! The customer service at ASOS is joke, compared to any online fashion website you could name. I will NEVER EVER shop at this website again. No business will succeed this way. We will see."
"mber 12, 2018",1,ASOS sent me a box which had been tampered with and the item stolen then refused to compensate me.,"I ordered a watch for my son's christmas present via ASOS last week on line.  I thought i had  ordered clothes from them previously without incident but have now realised I was a first time customer. The parcel was delivered by Royal mail. The external packaging was intact although ridiculously large for the size of the item which was a wrist watch. I was surprised to find the dress box for the watch out of its plastic packaging and flopping about in the large box. When I opened this I foung a geniune Armani booklet and watch mount but no watch. ASOS do no provide a direct telephone customer support service. I have emailed them with no response. I have facebook messaged them with a response that they have acknowledged contact and will be in touch but no time scale. I have retained all packaging and my fear is they will counter that we are laying a false claim of theft in transit. The bottom line is that I will have go to a shop and buy my son his gift ahead of the big day and be out of pocket twice.Today I received the following response from ASOSello,After an assessment of your account, we've made the decision to not issue a replacement of your item:- Armani Exchange AX2099 Chronograph Gold Stainless Steel Strap WatchIt‚Äôs very rare for items to go missing and ASOS have therefore made the decision to not accept any further orders from you.  In order to take this further, we recommend contacting your payment provider to dispute any lost funds. Your payment provider may be in touch with ASOS and we'll be able to provide information regarding your account to support their investigations. Once they're happy this is a genuine claim, they may refund your account.  In the event further orders are placed, they'll be cancelled. As we‚Äôre unable to help you further with this, any emails received about this matter will be automatically closed down with no response Stephen.Best Wishes,Customer Verification TeamASOS Customer Care.So not only am I now out of pocket, I have had my character assassinated insinuating that I am a fraudster. This is a complete stonewall. It stands to reason there is a weight difference in a box dispatched with a watch in it and a box arriving at its destination without it ."

Ordered late Sunday evening, a few items, Wednesday today and my delivery was already with me safely at my work place as promised! This was free delivery and in December!

"mber 12, 2018",2,Don't value their customers,"While they have 24 hour chat, it doesn't seem to be something they should pay for given the customer experience team is clearly just there to tell you tough cookies on any of your problems. Their solution is to have you reach back out at specified times just to get the same answer... there is nothing we can do we are sorry. It is the most frustrating merry-go-round you will ever get on. The tracking doesn't update and when you do get your package (1-2 weeks late) half of it is good quality and half of it looks like a child picked the material. I can deal with the hit or miss clothes, but the customer service making the already frustrated customer do all the work, and constantly saying reach back in a day or two, only to yet again tell me there is really nothing they can do and they are sorry if I am upset, seems unacceptable to me. Answering the question with a straightforward answer, and not a false promise that someone will fix it in the future would be more satisfying. Just know what you are getting into, and don't expect your items to be there for any specific occasion."
"mber 12, 2018",1,Don‚Äôt order anything from asos unless you want to donate to them without receiving goods,"I recommend against doing business with asos. On the surface, the asos web site seems comparable to Urban Outfitters or Zara, but the similarities end there when you click to submit your order. At that point, your order falls into the black hole of their order fulfillment and customer care (more like customer chaos). None of the dates will match reality. Your order is ‚Äúdespatched‚Äù, which means, thrown in a pile to wait until you complain. The date promised for ‚Äúdelivery‚Äù is the date they start manufacturing the items in your order. The ‚Äútracking‚Äù will indicate ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù for many days while the items are made. At no point will the tracking actually get updated or show where exactly your package is located. During this process, you contact their customer chaos group, thinking something must be wrong. Scarily, you discover that this is business as usual and the kind of unprofessional chaos that constitutes their company. Each person will lie to you about where the package is and when it is coming. You will hear many different dates from many different people.If you compare this buffoonery and chaos to dealing with Urban Outfitters, where you can actually talk to real customer care people by phone without waiting on hold, people who can nicely tell you exactly where your order is and the exact day you will receive it, it‚Äôs very sad. Compare it to Amazon, and it‚Äôs a joke. I‚Äôve waited 2.5 weeks for ‚Äúin stock‚Äù items that Amazon would have delivered in 48 hours. Still have no idea if I will ever receive my order.If you look on LinkedIn, there are 100+ people listed as the CEO of asos in a range of countries around the world...Australia, Turkey, even someone in West Virginia. If you look on the asos jobs website, it says 30% of their workforce is in the customer chaos group. How come none of them seem to know when a package is scheduled for delivery? How many thousands of people does it take to screw in a light bulb? I‚Äôve conversed with a dozen different people in customer chaos about my package. They all give a different date for delivery. Many of the dates have long past. Some offered me a discount on my next order...why would I throw more money into the black hole when I never received my first order?"
"mber 11, 2018",3,Not great service overall as my order‚Ä¶,Not great service overall as my order was extremely late and even though it arrived in the end it wasn‚Äôt the right size
"mber 11, 2018",2,Overall experience has been below‚Ä¶,"Overall experience has been below average... They do not offer any type of price guarantee... I bought some products off their site and the next day everything was discounted. I reached out to customer service to see if anyone can help me out and they told me the only way to take advantage of the sale price is to return the other items and place a new order. To me this sounds like a waste of money, time and resources for both parties when we can achieve the same results if ASOS did like a two-day price guarantee. This is something I hope ASOS looks into and considers doing or else they'll lose a returning customer."
"mber 11, 2018",1,Abismal customer service and no responsibility for delivery problems,"My order was due to arrive yesterday. I was busy changing my baby when the doorbell rang and hoped they would leave a card or put it in my safe place. Not so. No card was left, but Hermes sent an email saying delivery was successfully delivered to me (my name) with a signature included (not mine). I‚Äôve checked safe spots and nothing. Tried contacting ASOS but their chat wasn‚Äôt working well and I was left waiting then disconnected. Their email form also wouldn‚Äôt send. I finally reached someone on chat after 3 long attempts to be told I would hear from them in 5 days but if not to contact again. What? I was counting on my order for an event this week and feel jilted. Nothing was done to reassure or correct the situation, which includes fraudulent practices (forging my signature). Furthermore I have not been given any contact information to complain to Hermes, their courier, directly. Abismal service!"
"mber 11, 2018",1,Worst customer service i have ever‚Ä¶,"Worst customer service i have ever experienced. My return didn't move for weeks and they kept wanting me to wait ten days to START a case for my lost return. And then they kept changing the date that was the 10th day. Oh, and I had to contact them over FIFTEEN times through every channel (facebook, facebook chat, live chat, and email) to finally get any response. I will NEVER EVER shop here again. When pretty much every other e-commerce site will bend over backward to accommodate you, and ASOS can't even do the bare minimum, there is no reason to shop at this trash bin. One person at ASOS ""Hi Rae, I'm really sorry you feel this way and will be happy to resolve this for you. We have a process in place and we must allow till after the end of the day on 10 December 2018 before I can look into this further.

THIS IS ABSOLUTELY, WITHOUT A DOUBT, THE MOST INCREDIBLY HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED!!!  BEWARE!!! Do not buy anything from this rip-off company!!!  I ordered 8 items from ASOS for my daughter for Christmas gifts.  I placed my order on October 29, 2018, and I specifically asked about their extended return policy for Christmas gifts.  They told me there would definitely be an extended return policy, but that it had not been posted on their website yet.  So, of course, I thought there would be no problem if we needed to return something that didn't fit.  HOWEVER, as it turns out, in order to return something under their Christmas return policy, your order had to be placed on or after November 1, 2018.  I placed my order three days before that date.  But I had no way of knowing that I was placing my order too early!  They should have told me that, especially since I told them the situation and asked about it.  They will not make any exceptions at all!  So, I can tell that at least one item is going to be too big, but I'm stuck with it!  Of course, they said I could send it back and then the warehouse would decide if I would get a refund.  Now why would I do that?  I am not sending anything back unless I'm guaranteed a refund!  That's just crazy!  And my customer service rep, Tania, was like talking to a robot!  We did this over chat.  She just kept saying the same thing over and over again and was not helpful at all!  Basically, all she kept saying was that there was nothing she could do because that's their policy.  She did not answer any questions that I asked either!  Just horrible!  I told her if she did not resolve this issue to my satisfaction that I would NEVER buy anything from ASOS EVER AGAIN and that I would post terrible, negative reviews about ASOS.  She did not seem to care at all.  I also asked to speak to a manager or someone above her.  She said everyone is trained the same way and will tell me the same exact thing.  I told her that a good, decent company that wants to keep its customers would make an exception under the circumstances.  No response.  So then I looked at the reviews, and it was no surprise that ASOS has horrible reviews!  Wish I had looked at them before!  Clearly, ASOS does not care at all about their customers!I'm just furious!!!!!!  STAY FAR AWAY FROM ASOS!!!!!"

"mber 10, 2018",1,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER,"What a totally garbage company.  I placed an order on the 22nd of November, which was dispatched shortly after.  On the day it's supposed to be delivered I get a notification that there's a 72 hour delay.  I contact CS and they can't even be bothered to look into my order.  They tell me there's nothing they can look into for 72 hours and to contact them when the time frame is up.  I wait the three days and again, no package.  I contact CS and again they tell me there's another 72 hour delay, and they cannot tell me anything more about my order until those 72 hours are up.  I wait and no package arrives.  I contact CS a third time and, shocker, there's another 72 hour delay.  That brings us to today and I still have no package.  CS refuses to speak to me beyond the ""contact us in 72 hours"" nonsense, and also refuses to cancel my package.  What a truly horrible experience talking to these people.  CS acts like the customer is the one inconveniencing the company and that we have no right to be frustrated about a missing order that has been paid for.  I would stay as far away from this company as possible.  They are frauds.  Do not expect help.  Do not expect to be compensated for any mishaps on their end.  Do expect to be treated like absolute dirt."
"mber 10, 2018",2,Horrible customer service,"I usually never write reviews about anything but I just felt that I had to notify others about this issue. As a lot of people are shopping with asos more and more now. I ordered two items recently and they were meant to be a Christmas gift for someone. Once I received my order I saw that one of the items was not the item I originally ordered. It was completely different to what I had ordered, only similarities being the size and colour. I rang up the customer service and they assured me that they would arrange for me to receive the correct item. I also made sure to contact them by email so that they have proof in writing. In the email I clearly stated the item that was send to me and I clarified that this is not what I originally ordered. Two days passed and I received an email stating that my order is on its way, however once again it was the wrong item. At this point I was very frustrated and tired of calling their customer service. After speaking to them on the phone they realised the mistake and told me that the correct item will be send. I have my doubts... I do not understand how they can mess up my order to this extend when I made it very clear which item was send correctly and which one was not. Now it's been a week and I still have not received my item. At this time of the year making such mistakes is very frustrating for us customers because everyone knows the stress of getting presents sorted. This is very degrading for such an extremely well known company."

Closing down the chats. They still have my 1000 euros, but order is cancelled, and they will keep the money for 2 weeks before giving it back, meaning I have to buy new xmas gifts AFTER XMAS.DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM ASOS."

Delivery was attempted on the 5th, which is a complete lie since my address was a business address there were people here. CS solution was to ""reorder the items if you want"". That's it completely their fault but not even offered next day delivery for their mistake. Last time I will be shopping with these clowns."

They offered no alternatives, refused to accept it was their problem and just kept repeating themselves. The advisor, Erica, was really unhelpful and refused to let me make a formal complaint about either the order or her.

After 10pm I contacted them again and was informed that it would be delivered the next day and that the attempted delivery could have meant that the Van was broken rather then it being attempted at my address so I requested a refund for the delivery and was rejected! The guy says ‚Äòregardless of wheather you care what the email said the delivery was attempted‚Äô howeve 10 minutes before this he had informed me that the email could have just meant that the van had broken!!

Not to mention coustmer service has no number because they are very aware how many people have this frequent issue and hate there services and how they operate with communicating with coustmers.

Asos is a terrible company and I wouldn't reccomend."
"mber 09, 2018",3,It's a great hub for different brands...BUT,"It's a great hub for different brands, but it is what it is, cheap fashion, fast, and cheap, like really cheap. And this affects what you get, it's kinda like playing Russian roulette, sometimes it's good and most of the times not so much... Lately it's getting worse (and we are talking about the cheaper brands, like the own ASOS brand), there's always something that's off, you find your dream garment ¬¥, but it's cut weird, or the fabric is awful, or the pattern..or... ASOS just can't seem to get it right. Many of these clothes is very similar to to cheap ones at wish, and I often wonder ''who wears this??'', and ''who CAN wear this?'' it's often very poorly sewn, and not washable, like I said, there's just always something that's off, it's the common saying of ''You get what you pay for''. All this said, it's great hub for different brands, and kudos the stylist on ASOS, they always make the clothes on the models look like a million dollars!"
"mber 09, 2018",1,Absolutely atrocious customer care from‚Ä¶,"Absolutely atrocious customer care from ASOS this morning. Had an issue with my website shopping bag malfunctioning and disappearing. The RESERVED item in my bag then showed out of stock after my bag emptied by itself, meaning it was either still reserved by the (now non-existent) malfunctioned bag or the reservation system was not working. Thinking I could find out if the item had actually sold or was just erroneously showing as still reserved and save myself waiting the 50 minutes to test if the item would unreserve/make sure it wasn't lost forever, I got in touch with two of their reps. I was misunderstood, ignored, and met with absolute incompetence over and over again. I suggested that the item was showing as out of stock because it was still linked to the malfunctioning bag, and may reappear when the 60 minute reservation window ended. I asked the ASOS reps to see if they could check this, but they were not able as they do not have access to sales or reservation information - how can a site provide competent service without this info? I then asked simply if it was possible for an item showing out of stock to do so because it's still reserved by me as my bag was still stored on the system somewhere, the customer reps failed to understand this theory, didn't have an answer for something surely so simple about the website's workings, refused to contact anyone else in their department for information or escalate to a manager, and fed me copy and paste responses/just plain fallacious information about the issue. The first rep ended the conversation abruptly before a solution was found. She also stated emphatically that there was no issue on their end and later suggested clearing my cookies despite the product showing as out of stock for her too, showing that she does not understand what cookies do. Both reps stated repeatedly 'as the item is out of stock there is nothing we can do', despite the fact that I had reserved it in my own bag! At no point did I feel heard or respected as a longstanding ASOS customer, I felt like I was dealing with uninformed, overwhelmed employees with absolutely zero ability to comprehend or assist in my issue. I was told I had lost the item due to an error and there's nothing else that could be done. I ended up waiting the 50 minutes, and it turned out that I was right to begin with: the item was held in reservation by my original bag and had become available again! How could ASOS not tell me this incredibly simple information? Had I listened to the customer service reps, I would've not bothered to wait and lost the item forever. How can you trust a website and shop with peace of mind if the reservation system doesn't work properly, and how can the employees not know the way this website feature works?During this whole process, I complained about not being understood, and the ASOS reps continued to not be able to grasp the issue or escalate to anyone with sufficient understanding, it felt like they weren't properly reading my query or giving me any attentive care. I also asked for the complaints contact and was ignored twice.I could purchase the item from ASOS, but I will be purchasing direct from the retailer instead. The bad service has dissuaded me from using ASOS in the future. Do not buy here if you want a company that respects and values you. They do not invest in customer service sufficiently, evidently, and if you have any issues you will not be treated well."

Now first of all let me elaborate how extremely frustrating it is, that unless I call in to explain my situation I am most likely not to see this product like ever in my life, as of no one being able to explain the reason my parcel is still not with me! Now after being explained from your side the challenges you have - despite the fact that I have received another parcel yesterday assigned to the same exact address that I have provided to you - I have come up with an alternative solution which was to provide another address very close to the original one. Now your kind but less intelligent colleague has advised that this is not possible since the postcode has to match the existing address. Regardless of me trying to explain over and over again this to your kind yet again not so intelligent colleague that the address is assigned to the following postcode, he‚Äôs told me that he can not provide an alternative address to your courier, YET on their website they strictly point out that only the retailer can change the original destination of this. Now here I am again with no parcel - the suit I have ordered for my Christmas party which happened last night - with no money and with a lot of my precious time wasted. On top of that all you did was, not overcoming the challenge but given me the same solution which most likely is going to fail again based on the conversation with your colleague, as of your system not being able to allocate the postcode provided from your side! Here I am again waiting another day for you to come up with a better plan which we could‚Äôve been solved immediately but your reaction time and responsiveness makes me want to cry! Yours Sincerely Attila"

And ASOS are just like sorry pal nothing we can do about it.They chose to deliver through this carrier even though it causes us the consumers nothing but stress and wasted time even when we spend our money with them. This to me shows they have nothing but contempt for their own customers. I will not use them again in future and I recommend you don't either.
"mber 07, 2018",1,Bad service. Equally appalling customer service. DONT USE ASOS,"I am absolutely appalled with ASOS and their awful service. I had ordered $400 worth of winter clothes for my trip to Europe (I live in Asia) on November 22nd (before Black Friday) to avoid delays. My shipment is meant for express shipping and should have arrived within 2 days. The last time I checked, it‚Äôs STILL in international transit in LHR. I asked ASOS to check, and they gave me a very generic apology email and said that they would look into it. I can absolutely 100% believe that they have not done a thing to look into where my package is. I purposely ordered my stuff before Black Friday because a) I wanted to avoid Black Friday delivery delays and b) I wanted there to be ample time for me to return my items if they didn‚Äôt fit. At the moment I‚Äôm doubtful whether my package will even arrive on time for my trip. I have asked ASOS to compensate me for the inconvenience that they have caused, but they said that they can‚Äôt. Looking at the numerous horrible reviews and how often they probably get similar complaints, I can now understand why."
"mber 07, 2018",4,Good service with all my items‚Ä¶,Good service with all my items delivered to me just that it was delayed for a few days not a hassle at all even though I heard about the negative feedbacks on Asos I think it is a hit or miss but definitely good on my side
"mber 07, 2018",1,HORRIBLE THEIVES,"HORRIBLE THEIVESAbsolutely the worst company, I returned a jacket to them with THE RETURN LABEL THEY INCLUDED and another item. The other item was returned and processed the second one (which I paid $175 for) never showed up. The first time I contacted them they said give it a few more days so I did. I went back again after it had been over 2 weeks and they said a ""specialist"" would get back to me in 24 hours. After 3 days I contacted them again and finally got someone. They told me they could only help me if I had the proof or returns.....I used THEIR RETURN LABEL. No where on the returns sheet does it say ""Keep This We Dont Track It"". How do THEY not track their own returns. Haven't gotten resolution yet but as far as I can tell ASOS has just robbed me of $175 and I will be filing as such anywhere I can."
"mber 07, 2018",1,The worse service ever!,"Since they use My hermes as delivery company, they became the worse retailer ever. My hermes never comes to deliver my orders from Asos, sending email with sorry we missed you. No card left, not even a knock at the door. Simply rubbish. Please avoid as much as you can!"
"mber 07, 2018",3,the seem never to deliver on time,"I ordered men boots from them. Received the message from Hermes, courier they use, to expect the delivery on Monday 3/12, then received another message on Monday evening saying  my parcel has been delivered and signed for by... me. Obviously haven‚Äôt received any delivery and the signature in tracking information wasn‚Äôt mine. Wasted my time next day contacting ASOS and Hermes trying to find out where the parcel was. Eventually received the delivery two day later (why lie in the first place!). Partner had the same issue. Ordered bow tie to be delivered on certain date in time for Christmas party. Received message from them on the day saying they won‚Äôt deliver. Very poor service!"
"mber 07, 2018",1,Thiefs,"Ordered a present over two weeks ago - it still hasn't arrived. Checked DHL tracking (for some reason I kept getting directed to the German site), when i finally was able to view the tracking in English I was told that the order had been returned to the warehouse as it could not be delivered.Contacted customer service via the chat application and was told that DHL were not able to deliver the package (although there is a 24 hour doorman in my building) and that I need to wait 15 working days for the package to return to the warehouse and then a further 10 days to wait for a refund.Completely unacceptable!!!!! The package was a Christmas present - I now don't have the product or the money I paid for it!!!!!"

I've ordered about 30 times and I think I've received the wrong size like twice.The only thing I wish they would do is add the return slip in the package, it's annoying to have to find a printer."
"mber 07, 2018",5,brilliant to deal with,"ordering from them past 2 years, this year signed up for premium delivery best decision, package next day if i order before 8pm and no minimum spend, any issue always quickly resolved and returns processed within a week"
"mber 07, 2018",1,I will never order anything from asos,I will never order anything from asos again. I placed the order on 20th November. The package was supposed to be 23th November. It did not arrive. From 23th November I contact customer service. They told me to wait until 4th December. On 4th December the package did not arrive. Re-contacting customer service I find out that the package returned to them damaged on 23th November. It's a joke. they took money from my account (533 ¬£ !!!) and I can not get back my money. I'm dissappointed. I do not recommend
"mber 07, 2018",1,"They ""PLAYING""  with you.",I will never ever shop here.  Buy the time you receive your order you will forgot that u ordered something. They are not reliable. and your order will not arrive on time (Very Late) . This retailer will shut down soon hopefully.There are other websites you should go and check. don't look at their prices.
"mber 07, 2018",1,Will never shop there again,"Will never shop there again. Be careful that they intentionally made the return extremely difficult for you.I made two orders, one to Austria, was returned automatically without me even receiving it. and they cannot provide a sound reason.The other to Singapore, I received, tried on, and needed to return. the procedure is the most complicated I've seen: you need to enter BY TYPING ""product description"", ""code"", ""price"", ""quantity"", etc. Really, grocery shopping here is easier to report a problem of your items. And the delivery company never came to pick it up, I contacted all personnel I could, both from the delivery company and ASOS, yet they were simply ignoring me or copying and pasting rules, and not helping at all."
"mber 06, 2018",1,Undelivered good false promise,Bought a good on 26 Nov and estimated delivery time on 3 December. It hasn‚Äôt delivered now. Contacted their customer services and promised to get back to me within 24 hours. No one contacted me. They got the money and didn‚Äôt deliver the good. Avoid this company.
"mber 06, 2018",1,Retail cowboys,I ordered a present for my daughter. I was not at home when my delivery took place but received a card through my letterbox to say parcel under van. What van ????I  uploaded a picture of  this for ASOS and dpd but was told that I could not have  refund or replacement. I'm ¬£30 out of pocket with nobody taking responsibility for  this and thinks it's ok to leave a parcel under a van its beyond belief. ASOS are so rude its unbelievable never again will I order with this company. Contacted credit card company and will be informing trading standards about these cowboys.

"mber 06, 2018",1,Absolutely awful customer service,"I have been a customer of ASOS for years and have never had an issue regarding items or receiving orders like many people have. However I have asos vouchers to use but the website won't let me use them for some reason. Been on live chats and contacting via email for months but when I email they just say they will get back to me in 48hours and that never happens. On live chats I have found that they abruptly stop the chat halfway through. I really don't know how they get away with running a company like this, it makes me so angry and I think trading standards should get involved"
"mber 06, 2018",1,Poor Quality,"Ordered a coat from ASOS and the quality was terrible, on the pictures looked nice and warm, but was so thin, stitchings are falling apart. Managed to resell it on Vinted for ¬£20... Even 10$ coats from Aliexpress got better quality than a ¬£50 ""on sale"" coat from ASOS."
"mber 06, 2018",5,Helpful and speedy,"There was an error with my order. I had an item missing so contacted ASOS straight away. They really helped me out, said to wait 24 hours while they investigated. They took a day extra to respond but it was post black Friday event so I am still delighted with the speed it was handled."
"mber 06, 2018",1,Awful customer service,"Awful customer service, ASOS. I have returned four items from the order I have placed, however, only got a confirmation that one of the items was returned (rather than four!). Online customer service is useless, and told me to get in touch with you via the social media. Please advise."
"mber 06, 2018",4,Great company,"Great company, I always buy their multipack clothes. They‚Äôre such good value for money, even though the quality isn‚Äôt as good."
"mber 06, 2018",1,Terrible customer service.,"Terrible customer service.I ordered an item and received the incorrect item. I sent it back and ordered it again. Second delivery I received the wrong item again. I raised this with ASOS customer complaints. They were extremely unhelpful. I pointed out that I had 2 wasted journeys to collect the wrong items. Their response was, you could wait at home to have items collected. This was their magical solution. Who has time to wait at home! Very badly trained staff, clearly the staff on the warehouse are not trained to read orders correctly. I will not be returning to ASOS."
"mber 06, 2018",1,steer clear,"I agree with some reviews here which say that merchandise hardly looks like how they are portrayed in asos website. Delivery is just as bad as well. The most appalling thing though is their absolute disregard for customer service. I received a note with my package with scribbling that said, 'f*** you, b****'. I contacted them with photos and they haven't even reached out to me after a week. All I wanted was an apology and reason to why this happened but it clearly is too much to ask for."
"mber 06, 2018",1,Honestly the worst customer service i‚Ä¶,"Honestly the worst customer service i have experienced in my life; timeline:28 Nov - order $500 worth of goods, delivery ETA Tuesday 4 December3 Dec - email to say items all delivered (early yay), get home to find only 1/5th of times delivered, $400 worth missing. 4 Dec - message customer service, who say will be referred on to specialist team, and need 24h5 Dec - no correspondence received, message customer service again. say need 48 hours - this customer service rep was EXTREMELY rude and cut me off. 6 Dec - no correspondence received , has now been 48 hours, message chat again, say need 48 hours and still no updates. ALL faith in ASOS lost, and now i still have no items, missing $400 of my money, and no idea what is going on. Stay clear."
"mber 06, 2018",1,Absolutely awful,"I‚Äôve been shopping with ASOS for years now and I‚Äôve decided to give up on them. Customer service is awful, I pay for next day delivery but items are never delivered on time and no notification is sent to say they‚Äôll be late.  Within two weeks of each other;I ordered a jumper which had makeup stains all over it and I‚Äôve never recieved an apology and was advised that it would be ‚Äúrelisted‚Äù on the website. - don‚Äôt order ‚ÄúMicha lounge relaxed jumper‚Äù üòÇI ordered boots with jaggy bits that cut my ankles and had to fight for a refund or an apology.

"mber 06, 2018",3,Everything I order on here never looks‚Ä¶,"Everything I order on here never looks like it does in the photos when it arrives. This is no exaggeration, I have bought 17 items off ASOS in the past year, some for me, and some as gifts.In total how many have I kept.... 1!!The quality is terrible, the fit of the clothes do not look like they do in the photos / descriptions.To order items on here for nights out, do not rely on this as your only option would be my advice."
"mber 06, 2018",1,Terrible customer service,"Terrible customer service. All the express deliveries are late. I ordered from them three times, and it never comes on time. This time I ordered 2 parcels on the same day, somehow one managed to reach the delivery courier, the other could not even clear customs. I was told there was a delay with the carrier and I had to wait a whole week after my estimated delivery date - never even told me what sort of delay it was and subtly but repeatedly hinted me to close the chat when I probed about it. How ridiculous, making a big purchase to get express 2-day delivery and being told you need to wait 10 days for it. Even slower than standard delivery? God knows how long I have to wait if I had picked standard delivery. Probably the last time I'll ever order from them."
"mber 05, 2018",1,"Ordered on 25th November,stated latest‚Ä¶","Ordered on 25th November,stated latest delivery is 4th December. 3rd december hadnt even been dispatched but was told to wait until the 4th,i did and it didnt come. Was then told to wait until the 6th by extremely unhelpful customer service who just kept sending me a tracking link. Contacted hermes,they said they lost it after it was dispatched from asos warehouse. I told asos this and have been told i have to wait until the 12th December before they can do anything. I know the parcel wont come but they said they cant contact hermes until the parcel is 7 days late. Then they start the process which takes 7 days,then i have to wait for a refund. Absolute joke. No apologies no offer of refund no offer of discount on my next order. Absolutely nothing and so unhelpful. Why use a delivery company who you‚Äôre not able to contact?"
"mber 05, 2018",4,Quick delivery service as well,"Quick delivery service as well, even though I chose the standard delivery service. All clothes are beautiful and all my discounts are working perfectly well."

They have refunded the amount for the other two items and when i asked them why they haven't informed me before making any action they told me that they sent me an email (they lie as i checked junk folder and there was nothing there...). I have asked them when the other two items will be despatched and they told me that they sent my money back so i will not get the other two items of my order because there are not in stock and they do not know when they will be in stock.Such an unprofessional behavior, i lost the Black Friday period as i would have ordered from other online shop!Stay away from this site!"
"mber 05, 2018",1,ASOS is the absolute pits.,"For a company of this scale and with this image, it‚Äôs absolutely shocking how poor their customer service is. The customer service responses don‚Äôt deal with everything you‚Äôve raised, are usually standard and not personalised and they just seem incapable of actually resolving anything. It is he most frustrating customer experience I‚Äôve had to the point where I‚Äôm considering not using ASOS anymore. It‚Äôs my main source of online shopping at the moment so it‚Äôs a big deal to stop using them. But that‚Äôs how bad things have got now. If you don‚Äôt have any issues then ordering and delivery is great but as soon as something goes wrong there‚Äôs no hope. Absolutely atrocious, unacceptable, terrible awful customer service. I even tweeted out of pure desperation but that was completely ignored. I think we need another ASOS style online shop but with good customer service to rival ASOS..."
"mber 05, 2018",1,Been a customer with ASOS for years‚Ä¶,"Been a customer with ASOS for years now. Between the family we have spent thousands. Premier next day delivery renewed every year and we're the highest level on the reward system they use. DPD always get parcels out next day delivery with an excellent communication tracking system, but all of a sudden Hermes are being used more and more, DHL also. They both seem to be bad, Hermes is ridiculous and they need to get rid. I expect DPD is too expensive now. They've got rid of the A-List reward system thing and deliveries arent coming at all. Must have a ""do not deliver"" mark on our address. The last three orders we've made have not arrived. Two with Hermes and one with DHL. Not impressed. ASOS you've lost a family of loyal customers I used to trust the next day delivery now we all joke ""if Hermes comes up on the tracking you're screwed""!!!"

I was informed my parcel was delivered to the Collect + store on the 13/11. On the 14/11 I went to collect the order and was informed by the store that ASOS had requested a return of the parcel and it was collected that afternoon to be returned? I never requested a return and so contacted ASOS who had no idea why. I requested the resend me out the items next day as I needed them ASAP and they ""helpfully"" informed me the only way to sort this would be to order the items (and pay for them of course) again. The order was over ¬£120 which makes it an atrocious procedure. I was informed I would receive a full refund once my ""return"" was processed. Fast forward 3 weeks after my holiday and I notice I still havent received any refund or update from ASOS. When I click to view my order status it simply shows as ""shipped"" so I get in touch with ASOS who advise they still dont know where my parcel is? I checked the delivery tracking info and it says it was returned to ASOS on 19/11 (6 days after it already wasnt at the collection location) and there is no update since. This means that its been 22 days since I placed the order and I still dont have any order or my money back.Pathetic and their overall reviews here prove it."

I am not letting you keep my money any longer i need this outfit for a party and i need it before weekend!! Dispatch my order right now or refund me right now.

"mber 04, 2018",1,The worst customer service I have ever experienced,"Awful customer service. Ordered multiple pairs of jeans in different sizes to try on during Black Friday event. They were left by DPD in a communal hallway without my authorisation or signature. DPD sent the driver back to tell me where he left them, which was pointless. Then the driver came again the next day to try and get me to sign a piece of paper to say I received the delivery. I refused as I hadn‚Äôt. He told if I don‚Äôt he will get charged for the missing parcel, so obviously expected me to fork out over ¬£300 for his error. I‚Äôve contacted ASOS they have confirmed the driver did not follow procedure (he forged a signature, didn‚Äôt take a picture of where he so say left the parcel). But will not refund or replace the items, which is so shocking. They are an awful company and as someone else said verging on a scam website. I‚Äôve been told I have to contact my bank to try and get money back. Absolutely devastating to be down over ¬£300 before Christmas. Please do not use this company, the worst customer service I have ever experienced."
"mber 04, 2018",1,Honestly the worse customer service out there,"Honestly the worse customer service and about all you can expect from an online retailer. I would not mind half as much but the issue is I ordered an item for next day delivery waited at the required time window and was informed a delivery was attempted whilst I was in my flat and of course I apparently did no answer the door. NO ONE KNOCKED AND IF THEY DID THEY WOULD HAVE LEFT A DELIVERY SLIP WHICH OF COURSE THERE WAS NO SIGN OF. Same thing happens following day, I take 3 hours our of my valuable day to be in the house and same thing happens again then to find out they do the same the following day and then my item get's sent back to ASOS. Unless you like wasting your time waiting for packages that don't arrive and like being accused of not being in to answer the door when you were oh and appreciate very low standard customer service AVOID ASOS AT ALL COSTS."

Great, when the office is shut! None the less I make the exception and go to the office for the delivery. It doesn't turn up (DHL are the courier). I ring DHL who say the driver could not access the building (odd since the door was open and the intercom accessible). Despite being told it'd be delivered later that day, it still never arrived. I contacted ASOS via messenger *after they'd ignored earlier emails for 24hours. ASOS claim they have no ability to influence the delivery companies who they have allowed (allegedly) to decide to return the parcel to them. What's more annoying is the DHL driver turning up in my office on Monday 3rd claiming to be there to collect a parcel. Now I'm thinking the parcel has been stolen or gone missing and ASOS say they will process a refund when they get the parcel back. This is unacceptable, ASOS are responsible for delivering goods (by law)  and by a specified date. Yet they shirk this and blame others, and have no interest in resolving issues, sending the same lame responses to every query raised. I am starting to feel like they're a struggling company, I won't be ordering anymore."
"mber 04, 2018",1,Very poor customer service,"Very poor customer service. Ordered only once and will never do that again. There was no tracking info for my item and now DPD are sending it back and asking me to reorder and get a refund later, although nobody from ASOS or DPD bothered to contact me. On top of all, they are refusing to give me my 20% discount with the initial order, despite the fact that the failed delivery was not my fault. Also they haven't provided me with any information  when I will be refunded. This website is a total scam"
"mber 04, 2018",1,Extremely poor customer service!,"Ridiculously poor customer service!I wasted a day waiting for Hermes to collect an Asos return. Nobody showed up. I just contacted Asos customer service (Hermes does not have a number or email to contact them!) via chat, asking them to contact Hermes as I could not stay home another full day waiting for them, and I needed them to collect the parcel tonight or tomorrow before 11am at the latest. After waiting 10+ minutes for a rep to appear on the chat, I explained the issue, and he apologized for me not having received my order. I was complaining about a return!!!! He apologized again but proved his further inutility by saying that Asos offers other 5 ways of returning an item and I could try other ways. Are you kidding me? I explained twice my request and he didn't get it! How is that supposed to help me? This person shouldn't even have a job! As useless as someone can be!"

"mber 04, 2018",1,One star is FAR too good.,"One star is FAR too good.Placed an order for ¬£110 on a Thursday 29th November 2018, evening @ 11pm thinking I'd selected next day delivery, which I quickly realised the next morning I hadn't. So I got through to chat and asked if I could upgrade delivery. They said I couldn't and that I'd need to wait for delivery the following Friday (8th December 2018).At this point I decided I'd cancel my order as I needed the items that weekend, and unfortunately it was pointless me waiting for another 8 days for items I'd no longer want/need.I went and purchased some of the items elsewhere and got next day delivery no issue, great I thought. I'll just cancel my order now with ASOS as it's not needed. So less than 12 hours after placing my order, I get told no ""you cannot cancel, you have 1 hour to cancel after placing it"". So ASOS are telling me I can't cancel an order I no longer want, and will have to wait for items to be dispatched out to me (in 8 days time), then once they've been delivered get them returned myself back to ASOS, then wait for them to receive them back, then wait up to another 5 days for a refund... What kind of company CAN'T CANCEL AN ORDER 8 days before delivering it?I complained that it didn't make sense for them to spend money sending something to me that I don't want, and then me have to send it back, so they said they'd escalate and call me back that day - which to be fair they did. On the call the staff member advised me that they would be able to cancel, but only once I get my dispatch notification and tracking information. Very polite, no issues I though.So I wait ALL weekend, then on Monday (3rd December 2018) contact them now I have the tracking number. I then get told I have to wait until it's active as the tracking number doesn't work just yet. Okay, fair enough I though. So I wait another 24 hours. Once tracking is now working I speak to them again ONLY TO BE TOLD THEY CANNOT CANCEL MY ORDER AGAIN!!!WHAT ON EARTH!I am now told I again have to wait for the items to arrive, then send them back myself. An order I DO NOT WANT.I've ordered many times with ASOS before and never had any real issues, but I will not be shopping with them again, and suggest others AVOID AVOID AVOID.By law, any customer purchasing online in the UK has LEGALLY got 14 days from delivery being made to them to cancel an order. And being told I cannot cancel until I have had the goods sent is just ridiculous. It literally makes no sense.Apologies for the rant, but I feel I should get my experience across - it's just anti-consumer and such a massive mess on. I guarantee it is like this in order to stress/confuse people into submission and into doing what ASOS want. They are not helpful at all!Await your response ASOS, but judging by your other reviews, I don't hold out any hope of getting a resolution and am resigned to not seeing my ¬£110.99 until about 5 weeks time :(Gary"

To make things worse, they don't have a customer service phone number... Like are you kidding. Its the 21st century ASOS if you want to have better public relations improve your customer relations and don't lie about your shipping dates. Its quite literally false advertising as I got a confirmation email saying my package was expected for the next week right after I ordered even though I paid for the two day shipping.

However, they were not able to explain to me how the credit card charge was posted and cleared if it was ""denied."" Based on my experience, I am NOT waiting for this ""refund"", as they claim no order even exists! I have initiated a dispute with my credit card. Meanwhile, the item is now out of stock, and I was unable to order it since they no longer had my daughter's size.  Oddly, I was texting my daughter about this whole thing while it was going on, and she went online (she is in another state) and ASOS showed availability in the boot in her size. What!?!  And no, it wasn't her cart that had taken what I wanted.  My end showed no availability before, during and after hers did. So I had her order it, but I don't trust that she will get them until I actually see them!  I will never order from them again.  UPDATE: I am upgrading my review to 3 stars (from 1 originally) because a very pleasant higher level customer service person called me today and she was finally able to tell me what had happened with my order. It turns out that my order did ship, and that the two agents with whom I'd previously chatted online had given me incorrect information. I am supposed to receive the boots in about a week, and I have since canceled my dispute with my credit card.  Because ASOS finally got it straightened out and gave me a discount code for my next purchase as a way of acknowledgment and apology, I give them an upgrade for getting to the bottom of it. Of course now I will have to return one pair but at least return shipping is free."

I had a missing item and decided it was too much of a hassle to get a replacement for one item and just wanted a refund. The person couldn't even give me a straight answer or go into depth on how they were going to proceed with my issue. Sad really since asos it pretty great place to shop at. Never experienced this before, so maybe it wasn't my lucky day. But I'm being harsh with the two stars, so asos can realise they need to filter out the unhelpful customer service provided at times."

I purchased an outfit for a special upcoming event that I needed it for with plenty of time to spare. While this was the main reason for ordering from them, I also purchased some other things I liked. I paid to have my order shipped to my house by November 26th and on my order information, this was written by THEM very clearly. After my order didn't arrive on the 26th, I gave it a couple of days in hopes that maybe it was just delayed due to the holidays. Finally after 2 weeks of no tracking updates, I called the tracking company to see where my package was. They informed me that ASOS never sent them the package. After multiple attempts to contact ASOS with no luck, I was finally sent an email that ""there were complications with my order"" and that I would be reimbursed. Well now I have no outfit for my event, I still haven't been reimbursed, and the last person who I talked to via online chat (Rhia) rudely sent me a link to reorder all of my items (which I haven't been reimbursed for nor received) and then she left the chat without any further assistance. Finally I decided to bite the bullet and just place a completely new order of all the items I never received but paid for, and they were out of stock in my size in 4 of the items. Needless to say, I will not be ordering from ASOS ever again and would not recommend anyone chance going through this process with a company of such awful customer service."
"November 29, 2018",1,Absolute joke customer service,"Absolute joke customer service. Hermes are appalling and ASOS won't even attempt to help you get your parcel, instead they say they can't contact the courier, that hermes will only attempt 3 times (complete lies) and when hermes turn around and flat out lie that they delivered the parcel, ASOS don't even care. As someone who has been using ASOS for years (since the as seen on screen launch days) they've finally lost my sales."
"November 29, 2018",2,The service I have recently received‚Ä¶,"The service I have recently received from ASOS has been awful. I usually don't have a problem with them until recently. Since they are only located in the UK and I am in the US, I have had to use their online chat service to talk to their customer reps and man was I given the run around.  My package was very late and still hasn't arrived and I was given mixed dates and lied to about getting a refund on the original date.Recently after contacting them after the fourth time, I eventually got a email saying I should receive a refund within 5-10 days. Since I have been lied to previously, I am not sure. Hopefully this ordeal can hurry up and be over with."

The estimate delivery date flew by and still no purse. I decide to message the company asking where my package was and they sent it TO THE WRONG F*CKIN ADDRESS. Then they attempted to blame it on me saying that I made the mistake, but why would I confuse myself and put an address I‚Äôve never been to instead of the address I have lived at for almost 4 years? Anyways. They never admitted to their mistake nor even attempted to fix the problem. And for about a month and a half I‚Äôve been getting the run around for a refund. They told me to wait a month to see if it just magically shows up at my address and then another month to ensure that I haven‚Äôt gotten it. I still haven‚Äôt gotten my refund. This website must be run by an amateur(s) who clearly don‚Äôt know how online shopping works. In a nutshell, this company is trash that will send your package to the wrong address, blame it on you and refuse to give you back your hard earned money! STAY AWAY!"

I have sent a withdrawal form to their cancellation dept and received yet another standard reply.Please, if you are in similar situation write to Watchdog or retailadr.

"November 29, 2018",1,Hugely Downhill,Asos has gone to the dogs. I don't know who they have hired in their 'customer service' department but it is a complete disgrace. Asos are fond of tricking you with 'express delivery' which will never come on time. Do not rely on them for an important occasion. They also may send you the wrong item if the item you are looking for is going out of stock quickly just so they can make a sale. Waste of time returning some hideous pyjama set when you ordered a summer dress. Disgustingly careless organisation.

Order sent back by DPD with message saying can't delivery to any address other than billing address. ASOS live chat fobs me off with 'please wait 7 days for the order to be returned so we can process and refund then you can place a new order'. After much back and forth I get an email saying the delivery never left ASOS and they are sending a new order (minus 2 items that are now out of stock) which will be delivered to the same collection point the next day. Well, today is the next day and what do you know... I get the same 'order sent back by DPD' email so again I get on ASOS live chat to be given the same cookie cutter response of wait 7 days blah blah blah. So, to summarise, like most peoples experience, if you order their stuff and it arrives then you probably think they're great. However, if you order their stuff and it doesn't arrive... well, the reviews speak for themselves. I imagine after several further chat and email conversations I'll eventually get a refund for the order, by which time the remaining items will likely be out of stock too. If only Wiggle branched out into fashion..."

In my case, I have contacted them 5 times already since I placed my order with the fast delivery service on 11th Nov, because I dont get any update on the tracking number that they provided, and today 28th Nov they are just telling me that my parcel is already with the courier and I should wait at least until the 3rd Dec for them to be able to do something about it in case I havent received my parcel by that time. Not to mention that every time I speak to someone different from the CS Team, she/he tells me a differrent story... any way, when I complained and said that I wasnt happy about the situation, the customer service rep just said that I had to wait a bit more and closed the chat inmediately... It is so frustrating to realise that they dont care at all and just want to take it easy. I used to shop online from them but I would double think it if I had to do it again. It sucks!"

Because in the terms, it says that if the items you kept are below the minimum value applying this code, they will be reverted to full price. So the refund = value of the items returned - discount = 17-16.8=0.2These terms and conditions are not reasonable and never happened on other online platforms.

I contacted customer service asking for a refund, but they would not give me one. Instead, they said they shipped the item out to me already, so in order to get a refund I would have to return the item myself. By this time, it's already too cold to wear the item I ordered, which was ordered when it was 30 degrees warmer. I have to make the extra effort to ship them back an item that they had forgotten to send me in the first place, and they didn't even say sorry or offer ANYTHING."

They even decided to split one of my larger orders into two parcels which then incurred two import charges, even though they assured me that one order regardless of how many parcels will incur only one import charge. I contacted ASOS re this and was told to chase customs even though this happened because they decided to put it into two parcels. Regardless, they were the ones that submitted the documentation to customs so in my opinion they should be the ones calling customs and going through that headache. Another annoyance is that the payment of these fees delayed the shipment. Luckily, I was in country and received the email but this may not be the case for others.The fact that there are additional hidden fees is not acceptable for such a large company. I frequently shop online with majority of purchases being sent from overseas and have not experienced this before."

They sent the order back out which was kind of them, however, before they did this I reordered the items myself. So when I received the missing order, I returned everything as I already had it. They didn't refund me the full amount and claim that I didn't return one item which I already had, therefore did not need TWO! To top it all off they will no do anything about it.

My next day delivery parcel was late which I would not have complained about as long as they reimbursed me for delivery costs however Asos were unable to tell me when my parcel would be delivered and told me I would just have to wait and see. As I was going away I cancelled the order and was reassured it would be cancelled. ¬£500 + was withdrawn from my account and the parcel is missing.

And for some reason they seem to look so good on the model but the ammount of times ive received my asos order and not been satisfied is starting to highly annoy me. For instance I ordered a UK size 12 suead slippers lined with fleece. Now the suede was like cardboard.... their was no give in the material. Then I ordered some shoes same issue they were solid I asked for a wide size 12 I could only just get my foot inThe material was cheap and very dissasitisfying indeed. Their clothes look great on the models but look very diffrent indeed when I put them on. I think they should focus on quality instead of their profit margins so much or their going to end up losing so many loyal customers and I shall be one.

I did so through the ‚ÄúTo You‚Äù in my local supermarket. Process was slower than using post office but then I hadn‚Äôt heard anything a week later. Contacted them and the customer service rep was very rude. I told her the tracking status said it was with them but she insisted I had to wait 7 working days. I asked to speak to a manager and repeatedly asked for my complaint to be escalted but was ignored. Waited until the 7th working day and was then told I had to wait until the end of the day and if I hadn‚Äôt received an email get back in touch. Very generic responses and not helpful at all. Contacted on the 8th working day and was told it‚Äôs now been passed to a ‚Äúspecialist team‚Äù and it would take a further 3 working days! Again I tried to complain and apparently ASOS do not have a complaints policy or procedure. Ridiculous. It will now be Monday before I get a decision on a refund- 14 days after posting the item which was evidently lost by the 3rd day after posting. What I don‚Äôt underestand is if I could prove I posted the faulty item why couldn‚Äôt they just refund me straight away? So frustrating.
"November 22, 2018",1,Appalling customer service via the‚Ä¶,Appalling customer service via the phone. They put all blame on Hermes and have no way to contact Hermes. I asked for my account to be deleted and the adviser said sorry to hear this... WTH!!!
"November 22, 2018",1,Atrocious first time experience,"My first time ordering from ASOS was completely and utterly disappointing. Made an order on 10nov, shipped on 11nov with a promised est. delivery on 19novGreat since I needed my stuff before 23nov!19nov passed, I didn‚Äôt receive a single sh√Øt. I contacted asos only to be told that there was a delay in their carrier and I‚Äôll definitely receive my long awaited items before 22novI held on to that promise but was met with ‚Äúin transit‚Äù from 13nov till now (23nov) 22nov passed, a friend who made her order a day after me had already received her purchases, her parcel status updated perfectly normal ‚Äì step by stepI of course went on to contact asos yet again to question on the frozen status of my parcel on the very same day, was again told to give it some time and wait till the end of the day to contact them Thing is, my local courier stops delivering after 6pm! I have repeatedly mentioned this to their team but was always placated with the same generic response. When 22nd nov torturously ended, I went to chat with asos team againIt was only then that they admitted they had lost my parcel All these could have been shortened to a mere adimittance and an email from asos‚Äô teamI now have to wait for a ‚Äúspecialist‚Äù to email me within 3days It‚Äôs unfortunately a huge sale season right nowIf asos decides to send me another parcel, won‚Äôt I still have to expect long delays and very possible loss of parcels? I can only hope they‚Äôll be generous and professional enough to provide express delivery to make up for their empty promises Let‚Äôs see if they can live up to their promises"

"November 22, 2018",1,Don't pay for next day delivery,"Paid extra for next day delivery. Received the order four days later. ASOS won't compensate the charge, saying it's 'out of their hands' when orders are delivered. That's fine if next day delivery is free, but when you pay extra for a service you don't receive, that's theft. When you cannot provide the service you're advertising to customers at extra charge, that's fraud. ASOS have, by far, the worst customer service ever. Even beyond companies that I've taken to court in the past. Unsurprisingly, over the past year the value of the company has plummeted and I hope it continues to do so."

Secondly, the clothes from the asos brand are of horrifying quality. I bought a dress and two buttons fell off whilst i was trying it on. The quality of the material is cheap and impractical.You will probably have to buy a size up if for some reason you do decide to order from the asos collection. I‚Äôm very dissatisfied and will not be ordering from their brand again"

'Now, I have ordered from another site who used the courier Hermes and I have just received that order fine asked the driver and he said no more delivers or drivers are due to this building today meaning......my package isnt coming today even though I ordered 2 days ago with next day delivery, please can someone accept this is lost and send me out a new parcel.' thats what is add to the live chat person and she ended the chat. the parcel isnt coming and I want a refund and no one will action this."
"November 21, 2018",1,Asos don‚Äôt give a damn the second they‚Äôve been paid,Any company that takes your money then denies all responsibility after with regard to deliveries is not a company people should deal withThey employ couriers then refuse to contact them if there are any problems I will not be buying from a company that treats people like this ever againShame on you
"November 21, 2018",2,Deliberate sabotage,"Deliberate sabotage. I have purchased from ASOS multiple times and the most recent order was quite a large order of five items totaling $420. After discount I paid slightly above $290, which allowed me to enjoy express shipping. The order was placed on the 12th of November 2018. A few days later, I received notification from the shipping company that stated that my items could be taxed. According to my country‚Äôs tax policy, I can import tax-free, up to $400. Beyond that, I will be taxed 7% goods and services tax. ASOS had sabotaged me by declaring the five items a whopping $471.01! That‚Äôs malicious and unethical. I didn‚Äôt buy that much nor paid remotely close to this figure. Jeez. But this was quickly resolved by me when I forwarded them the correct invoice. But guess what. Today, 21st of November, my item is still sailing the slow boat to me. The tracking just reflected that it‚Äôs been shipped. That‚Äôs two slap of my face. Over declaration and slow shipment. You guys and gals decide if this is worth the aggravation."
"November 20, 2018",1,GNEWT delivery,"ASOS recently started using a new delivery company called Gnewt. This company‚Äôs services are abismal. They allegedly attempt to deliver the parcel on 3 occasions however, they did not once leave an attempted delivery slip and I can see online that they did these 3 ‚Äúattempts‚Äù were all around the same time on 3 consecutive workdays. Taking into account that most people work 9 to 5 I think it would have been only natural for gnewt to have let me rearrange the delivery after one failed delivery attempt rather than continue to try delivering my parcel at the same time the next 2 days. They also never contacted me to say that a delivery was attempted and it had failed, it was up to me to keep checking their tracking services to find this out. They also did not attempt to leave my package with my next door neighbour on any of the 3 occasions and he was home for all 3 deliveries as he is a pensioner. They also never informed me that my parcel was being returned to ASOS, on their online tracking it does say ""RTS"" which I know realise it means Return to Seller however there is no explanation of what this acronym means on their website. This is by far my worst experience with a delivery service, they do not make their costumers' life easy and seem unable to accommodate for anything.Althought ASOS costumer service was responsive, they did not take the issue seriously and simply said I can reorder if I want.Online shopping should be a fun and exciting experience, Gnewt is managing to turn this into a stressful and ""hope for the best"" experience."
"November 20, 2018",1,Customer service terrible,"Customer service terrible. Keeps having all kind of excuses for late or even not shipped delivery. They cant even give me a trackingnumber. They end chats in customer ""care"" when it gets to difficult to find more excuses. Im fortunate and happy, that i could stop the payment through my credit card company after reading all bad reviews in here. Seems Asos have become scammers. Pitty, I used to like them.Not spending another cent on this bull...t company any more."
"November 20, 2018",1,Literally the worst customer service‚Ä¶,"Literally the worst customer service I've ever come across. Two delayed parcels, still not received or refunded. Useless CS team on Facebook and Twitter keep telling me to wait different dates. When the date comes they are telling me to wait until another date. It's been two weeks since my parcels should have arrived and the useless advisers are sending automated standard responses. I've messaged them so much now that they're ignoring me. Don't know where to go from here.Yes you can get nice clothes but there is no point ordering from them because as soon as there's a problem it turns into a nightmare. I will avoid at all costs. I actually hate ASOS."
"November 20, 2018",1,This company is a JOKE,"This company is a JOKE. My order was supposed to arrive on 18/11/18 and prior to that I had used to online tracking service which they provide to ""enable customers to know the whereabouts of their items"". Placed the order on 10/11/18 and they stopped updating the status on 16/11/18. (So since then till now, 20/11/18, the status has been stuck at ""in-transit"".) On 18/11/18, I decided to go on their live chat and ask for assistance in checking the whereabouts of my order and all they could tell me was to ""Wait till the end of the day, if you haven't received it by then, we will look into it for you"". Mind you, I tried asking multiple times and all 4 CSO gave me the same reply. Fine, I waited it out and surprise surprise my order wasn't delivered on the promised date. So I tried getting assistance from the live chat again, one CSO completely ignored me, the next told me that there was nothing she could do to check the whereabouts of my order other than the same online tracking page customers go to as it isn't updated by asos but by the courier itself. She then proceeded to tell me to give it till 27/11/18.  So here's my question, why did I have to wait it out when all you're gonna tell me is what I see on the online tracking page?? ASOS PLEASE. But that's not the worse part, the worse part is when I was explaining my side of the story to this CSO called Devinia (i think that's how it's spelt), telling her my frustrations and how the live chat hasn't been helpful thus far, she said ""Please refrain from using abusive language"". Oh my god. Jesus. Lord help me. Never in any one of the chats had I used abusive language so you can imagine how taken aback I was. It's one thing to not be able to solve a customer's problem, but a whole other to just blatantly accuse them of something they did not do? Asos, please get it together."
"November 19, 2018",5,Fast and easy returns,"Have ordered a few times and delivery has arrived before the expected date which was a nice surprise. Found it easy to return the items that didn't quite fit, which is super useful when ordering online as you never know how the clothes look on you until you actually try them on. Took the parcel to the Post Office and pretty much the next day got an email from ASOS saying my refund was being processed and got my money back shortly after that. Will be ordering again given the ease and convenience, knowing I can return items that are the wrong size"

They are not shipping from their US warehouse to US customers and 2. That the ONLY category incurring customs charges (sunglasses) are being sent from UK, not the US with their free 2-day shipping.  I didn't even know things could get from UK to California in 2 days.  Now I'm paying $195 for $94 sunglasses that I could have purchases from a reputable company in US. Huge regrets after my first time shopping with these slobs."

After investing yodel lost my parcel and tried lying saying it's in a shed but I don't own a shed.I'm very unhappy I've lost my money and I really don't want to use them again.

"November 18, 2018",1,Poor delivery and customer service,"I have shopped on Asos for years and very rarely have I had any issues regarding delivery..until recently. I placed an order on 30th October and as a premier customer I receive next day delivery all year round. However it is now the 18th November and I still haven‚Äôt received my parcel. I checked the tracking on Hermes and it said I had to take action and contact Asos, which I did. I emailed Asos and within 24 hours they responded saying that I had to contact Hermes as Asos ‚Äòweren‚Äôt able to contact them directly‚Äô. Even though the delivery of the parcel is the responsibility of Asos, I contacted Hermes but could only reach an automated system which told me that Asos cancelled the courier services on the 7th November. I then emailed Asos customer care again on the 14th November explaining this and as of the 17th I had no reply. I tried to contact Asos on Facebook messenger which says I should have a response within a few hours. Just under 24 hours later they responded asking for my registered email address so they could look into this further and after sending my email address no one has got back to me again. The order was for over ¬£130 and I am appalled at the customer service, or lack of.I will be taking this to small claims court if it is not resolved within the next week."

Still haven't received my package, this is bad business."

"November 16, 2018",2,ASOS keeping my money even though I don‚Äôt have the product,"I have shopped with ASOS for years now but whenever there is a problem they make it stressful to resolve the issue. I recently purchased a pair of shoes which they delivered in a bashed up bag with no box or return label. The shoes were tiny for a size 4 so I sent them back after going through the hassle of getting a new label from the Royal Mail. Due to my printer being broke this became difficult as I had to go to a particular post office to get a returns label (something ASOS should have provided) this has then resulted in the item getting lost in the returns process and asos happily keeping my money! I tried messaging the customer service team to resolve the issue, which they were very unhelpful!"
"November 15, 2018",1,I was a loyal customer but will now go elsewhere,I have brought a lot from ASOS in the past but I am really going off them because of their poor customer service. I have premier next day delivery. I order a gift and it doesn‚Äôt arrive on time but they tell me they can‚Äôt do anything about it. They are very unhelpful and will never go out of their way to make a customer happy. I can honestly say that I will now stop buying from them and will go elsewhere.

My most recent order was cancelled without them telling me, I even received an email the day after it was apparently cancelled telling me it had been dispatched. Unacceptable to start with.After emailing them 4 days after my parcel was due they told me it had been canceled because it was out of stock...all 4 items that I ordered apparently. After checking the website only 1 of the 4 things is actually out of stock. So basically they just couldn't be bothered to send the 3 items and refund one of them.In the email process I told them I wanted some sort of compensation for messing me around for a week and adding to the stress of Christmas shopping as I now have to do it again. They gave me a 10% discount code as I had originally used one on my order...It was a student discount code that I use on every order to really it was a useless discount code.Then to annoy me even more, I went to order the 3 items that were still in stock again and the ¬£13 credit I used to buy it has not been refunded to my account despite telling me that it has been. I cannot believe the bad customer service and website errors from such a big company. If I reorder the items from them I won't be using them again after that. Ridiculous."

WHAT?So, in the meantime I contact the parcel delivery company, ascertain my parcel has been deemed lost (after hours waiting in a queue, being told to wait 48 hours etc..) I then let ASOS know that Hermes have officially deemed it lost and told me to let the parcel sender know...SO I now send an email saying, if its been confirmed lost can you do something? Emailed back saying, yes please provide proof. Send screenshot. Email back says, thanks for this but actually you are going to have to wait a week either way. (Each email is sent to a new person, so they are all saying different things). OKKKKK I wait until the week has passed - GREAT NOW CAN YOU LOOK INTO IT? Yes, thanks for your email - has been passed on to a specialist team, please wait 48 HOURS. Hear back from them - sorry, can't send new stuff for half your items as we are NOW OUT OF STOCK. YAYOK, I want to speak to someone and complain - 'we aren't a call centre so you can't - hope this experience doesn't turn you away from shopping with us in the future'. WHAT A TOTAL JOKE. BOYCOTT."
"November 14, 2018",5,Good Customer Service,I've used ASOS since the beginning and never experienced any problems. For the 1st time last month Hermes lost my parcel and it was a nightmare and I was a little concerned as after many emails I was told I would need to contact ASOS to get my refund or parcel resent and after reading some of the reviews have to say wasn't sure if this would get sorted. Spoke to a lovely lady called Beth on live chat and she was very helpful and said I should hear back in 48 hours well I heard back later that day and all sorted. They've sent another parcel out and delivery will be today so very happy!

Online customer service agents that 1, Can't spell correctly. 2, Hang up on you when they think there right and have resolved the situation without asking the customer. Why they changed somthing that wasn't broken I don't know. I pay a ¬£9.99 fee a year,  which entitles me to free 24 delivery and returns.

"November 13, 2018",2,Goodbye Asos,"Used to be quite pleased with my orders and kept buying clothing for the whole family every couple of months, since selection is generally quite wide and good. I was first very pleased when they started co-operating with Klarna. Slowly noticed that name label quality went downhill and communication/marketing to customers was very unpleasant, not at all personalized and didn't feel valued as a customer. Now very silently and surprisingly they added a return fee of 10‚Ç¨ from Finland and that seemed unfair only because it was poorly communicated to customers. If I place 5-8 orders per year and spend quite a lot of my shopping budget to the company, surely they could at least inform customers about this kind of changes.Congrats Zalando!

ASOS CS could not establish why and when my package will be delivered. They don't cancel the orders either so now I need to wait for parcel to return to them.

So I chose Aramex Home Collection, just schedule a pickup and pass it along to the deliveryman. Simple? No.Deliveryman did not turn up at all while I was home the whole day. Contacted Asos on the next working day and the customer service officer told me they had no contact with ARAMEX. and I had to contact them myself. Why then did they ask to contact ASOS when you need help? They are not helpful at all. Rescheduled another pick up today but NO SIGN OF DELIVERY MAN AT ALL. Such nonsense. Quote from email: ""Amending your collection:If you need to change your collection date, or if you have missed the driver then please contact ASOS"", ""If you need any assistance please contact ASOS""Aramex has really bad ratings and is unreliable. Makes it really difficult to return items now. Definitely won't be shopping here as there are better websites that have faster delivery time and easier return methods.Update: Delivery man from Aramex did not turn up for rescheduled pick up"

"November 12, 2018",2,Recent experiences poor ‚Äì probably won't do business again,"Although I have shopped with ASOS for a couple of years now, I'm not very happy with my recent experiences. Ordered two dresses 3 weeks ahead of an event ‚Äì one was lost and delivered nearly a month later, the other was never really in stock. Another dress was recently missing a belt. Now I find out they've quietly dropped free returns to Finland and I'm left in the stink with a slightly ill-fitting dress made by their own label out of the cheapest fabric I've seen in a while. Customer service has been anemic nearly every time. Probably won't do business again ‚Äì simply won't pay ‚Ç¨10 to return a ‚Ç¨50 dress."

This item was apparently sent to the wrong address, but my address was clearly stated. Now the customer service assistant said he cant do anything, I have to order my item again and my refund will take 7 days even though i explained that i needed the items for an event. It is awful and they dont care at all."
"November 12, 2018",1,Shipping dates keep changing,"Like others, I'm having the same shipping issues. Trying to chat with humans who have been trained by bots. Credit card charged 11/1/18. Rep said order would be received by end of day on 11/9/18. It's now 11/12/18. Chat Bot says now to wait until end of day 11/13/18.  The shipping info seems bogus, there are NO tracking numbers. Says order arrived in US on 11/3/2018. That was 9 days ago. Chat bots keep telling me to check back. I don't have the time. Will dispute charge & never order from ASOS again. I suspect the order was never shipped. UPDATE: I filed a dispute with Paypal and my $$$ was refunded that day. It's 11/14/18 and STILL NO ORDER. I think this company is a scam. They charge your card & don't ship the order or ship the wrong items. They assume you won't have the time to make a fuss, especially with such poor customer service."

The gift was meant to be a birthfay gift but right now the plan is ruin. After waiting for 2 weeks, they send an email saying that the item is ""out of stock"" and will refund me . When i go back to ASOS website, the exact damn item is ""low in stock"" and i could still add it to my bag. I believe ASOS messed my order up and decided to give me a LOUSY excuse that the item is out of stock. On top of that, after wasting so much time waiting for my item that hasnt even been shipped out, I also incurred exchange rate loss as the amount that will be refunded is lower than what i have paid for. IF YOU DO NOT MIND WASTING YOUR OWN TIME AND POSSIBLY YOUR MONEY, THEN SHOP WITH ASOS :))))"

Too big and too small. I went about all of the return instructions carefully. Paid the money to send them back, also paid all the duty when the package had arrived. The whole incident costing just shy of 300 dollars. They received my package and claimed a refund would be issued in 10-21 business days. I HAVE NOT RECIEVED ANY MONEY IN MONTHS. Contacting the company was an absolute nightmare, and they asked to see my bank statement ? Showing I did not receive the money ? So for 21 days they want to see my transactions? I think this is a fraudulent company. They are absolutely awful to work with. NEVER EVER EVER ORDER FROM THEM. They deserve less than one star and should be shut down for this type of misconduct"

I used to praise them and I wonder if they have changed staff/customer service provider recently as I have had endless problems! Over the past few months (I use them a lot as I hate physically shopping and paid for ASOS premier a while back, but going to delete their app now) I have experienced lost parcels, dispatched emails when items not actually dispatched, refunds for new orders with no explanation, wrong sizes, refunded incorrect amounts, refunded for some items but others lost by asos - every time their online chat insinuates its my fault!!! The twitter team seem to be a little better but still no one seems to ever understand why these issues are annoying and no one seems to care - there is no sense of urgency and they are happy to hold onto your money while constantly telling you to ‚Äòwait another 48 hours‚Äô! Sooooo bad ASOS what has happened!?!?"
"November 11, 2018",1,Horrific customer service experience,"Horrific customer service experience! Avoid at all costs!! They advertise what appears to be a seamless experience as far as their return and refund policy which couldn't be further than the truth! I had faced an issue with their system which for some reason was not properly sharing information or requests with their chosen delivery courier and each time I spoke to a customer agent, they seemed to understand less about their own operations and return process than I did and I'm the customer! At one point, the agent I was chatting with began insinuating that it was my problem even through the error was in their own system and its integration with their delivery partner. In addition, the fact that they do not have a call center clearly shows that they have no interest in investing in customer satisfaction. Needless to say, the entire experience is one that makes it not worth shopping on this website. There are far better and much more developed companies out there that you can directly shop online from without having to feel like you're responsible for their own mistakes!"
"November 10, 2018",1,WORST SHOPPING EXPERIENCE,"What's the use of paying for express delivery when they can't even send on time.

ASOS is refusing to release the tracking number that they generated for the invoice, and refusing to cooperate with me on this matter.  Although they are not legally obligated to work with me, as someone who has spent 100s of dollars buying clothes from them, I am appalled that they are refusing to even look into this matter, let alone refund me my money."

Meanwhile Hermes are also completely ignoring me though they‚Äôre notoriously absolute w*nkers so I dunno why I‚Äôm shocked. I even sent my tracking info over to ASOS to show that for 9 days it hasn‚Äôt been updated. They don‚Äôt know where my parcel is, they won‚Äôt answer my questions, they wouldn‚Äôt let me have the parcel delivered to a different address and they are claiming they can‚Äôt contact Hermes, been absolutely disgraceful customer service for this entire experience and I‚Äôm not going to bother ordering from them again as they‚Äôve been SO unwilling to help me at all"

"November 09, 2018",4,"""Customer care"" misnomer UPDATE","Ordered advent calendar as xmas present.  It arrived, and some days later I opened the packaging in order to wrap it up.  The box inside the bag was damaged, so I pulled out the cardboard drawer underneath which holds the items hidden by perforated dates and discovered that number 11 was open and the item was nowhere to be seen.  You can't exactly look for it, as all the 'walls' are of cardboard and you would damage it further.  Immediately went on online chat (forever) and uploaded pictures (couldn't find telephone number at first) and they ended up saying customer care will get back to me.  6 days later, I emailed what's happening and the response was specialist team are getting back to me...how hard is this problem to solve? - although in reality I guess I could have damaged it myself if I were that sort of person, which they are obviously assuming I am - then I decided to search for their customer services number, which after about 30 minutes this morning at 9.15ish I have hung up without answer.  So where do I go from here when they've sold out and I can't prove it was damaged in transit???FAIR PLAY, they eventually got in touch and apologised for above. Then sent me out a new one no questions asked well in time."

So, not much in shops!Order was delivered on time, but the quality of the garments was atrocious, zips getting stuck and didn‚Äôt look like they‚Äôd last wrong, thin material and poor drape.  I‚Äôd rather pay more and get better quality garments.Will never be ordering from them again. Disappointed if this is why the high street is dying."

Apparently they couldn't find the address, yet also didn't call once to even ask directions if they were lost, and having waited in 3 evenings in a row because I repeatedly got texts saying they were coming that evening. Even more appalled that ASOS say they cannot do anything about this, cannot get them to send it to a nearby click and collect store nor to use the written instructions I provided. So instead, I am meant to re-order everything, hope it is all in stock, and pay for a further order, when ASOS won't even refund me for almost 3 weeks! Its a shoddy service. Can't trust them or their couriers. I have tried to go through their customer service team but just get told the same thing repeatedly. Nothing they can do?! I will be telling everyone I know not to bother taking the risk on ASOS for Christmas, birthday presents or any orders they might actually need because they'll simply be out of pocket and nothing will arrive, or if it does, not even on time. Reading all other recent emails, it sounds like you're doing this to a lot of customers lately. I wonder whether ASOS are about to go into administration hence the refusal to repay out of pocket customers. Don't use them"

"November 08, 2018",1,"Would not really recommend, far better services available on line that are far more reliable","I ordered some boots from ASOS as recommended by a friend for being a good company to order from. So i ordered a pair of chunky heeled boots and the package came on time within a few days which I was pleased with. However, when the parcel arrived they had sent out a huge faux fur coat instead. The item code and description was on the delivery slip for the shoes and even the sticker on the plastic bag for the coat was for the shoes, so i cant imagine how this mix up happened. I then went on to live chat with the customer service and told them i wanted a refund and did not want the shoes sent out anymore. They then said it would take 'up to three days' for them to send an email to me explaining how to go about returning it. I then received the email and it did explain that I should send the item back and should they not be able to refund the product they would 'let me know', this issue has yet to be resolved and i hope that they will sort this issue out promptly once the coat arrives to them. However, I very unhappy with the seemingly lazy and 'not really bothered' way they dealt with this issue. I expected more from this company and after trying them out for the first time I can honestly just say  I am left feeling quite annoyed."
"November 08, 2018",1,They ripped me off for $300 and my clothes,"I ordered over $300 worth of merchandise though ASOS, the parcel came in time however when I got it all the sizes were wrong. Not only that but the material of the clothing felt flimsy and fake. So I decided to return my parcel. I sent my parcel back over a month ago. Paid 112 dollars worth in shipping fees ""which they said they do not pay for when it clearly states on their website they do"" and they have still not received it. I'm upset over the fact that this company has basically taken their merchandise back and also 400 dollars from me. I have not been refunded and have contacted support teams which either do not respond for days on end or completely dismiss my situation. I would recommend never buying anything from this company  as it is easily the worst online shopping experience I've ever had. Absolute scam artists"
"November 08, 2018",2,What has happened to ASOS?!,"What has happened to ASOS?! I remembered a time when they used to be good.  For my recent purchases-  they sent me the wrong sizes.  Instead of sorting it out, I get a message saying ‚Äòwe‚Äôll be in touch in the next 3 days with an update for you‚Äô.  Really surprised by the poor service.  I used to be a regular customer because of its efficiency and reliability, but the service has definitely declined.  Unlikely to purchase anything from them again."

I spent over ¬£125 on clothes for my husbands birthday, but sent 3 unsuitable items back which still made my total spend well over ¬£80 but they took off the ¬£20 discount completely.  I emailed to say I wasn't happy and I expected them to drop the discount from ¬£20 to ¬£10 as I had still spent well over ¬£80.  They didn't care, just spouted about terms and conditions.  Left me feeling rubbish. I feel tricked and made to feel stupid for falling for their promotion.  They could have offered to refund the ¬£10 back but no they would rather have an unhappy customer so they've lost a customer and I'll be letting my family and friends know. I expect this happens to a lot of people. I can't bear companies who just don't care about their customers and use discounts only to clap their hands with glee when they can completely revoke them. Moral of the story I should have purchased a crystal ball and then I would have only spent ¬£80 but still got a discount. Its only ¬£10 but I feel cheated out of it and I told them this and they still don't care!"

I am clearly not talking about that order. The order numbers are totally different. I think they are trying to get out of paying me in which case I bloody want my item back but where is it? They can‚Äôt even tell me that. So they have potentially lost my item and won‚Äôt be giving me my money? Apparently there is no complaints department which is unheard of and I have to wait 3 days for a specialist team to get back to me. Ridiculous. Will not be shopping here again.

The loss of A-list is a major disappointment too, it was definitely something that had me coming back month after month. At this moment in time, they don‚Äôt really offer anything more than your average online retailer, if anything, it‚Äôs much less.

However in the last few months I‚Äôve had parcels not turn up, turn up in the middle of the night or just to be chucked over my back gate during various hours of the night/morning. After this I‚Äôve grown fed up and have complained to Asos after a parcel I had ordered didn‚Äôt turn up. I had no notification of delays and asos‚Äôs Customer care was bloody shocking. They essentially said ‚Äònot our problem‚Äô I received automated responses, different details on when to actually expect my parcel and no form of an apology."
"November 05, 2018",1,Horrible!!!,"Horrible!!!! For the 2nd time they lost my order and their attitude is far far away from being good support to customers. They repeat the same answer again and again, regardless of any arguments you bring. I think the good reviews are in case you don‚Äôt get in touch with any support function - if the order leaves on time and everything is in good condition. Otherwise, good luck speaking with anyone from there.Via 10 emails they gave me the same answer over and over again. Besides, they don‚Äôt even know how transportation work, who does deliveries until midnight?? (They couldn‚Äôt look into my order until midnight, as they are under the impression transport will happen after 8pm... )Hopefully I will get a resolution to my Last Order. The last one! Never again!"
"November 05, 2018",5,Yes please.,I have been a customer for several years now.Excellent service and fast.Products EXACTLY like the pics or the videos.My top online destination for shopping.Pure love.
"November 05, 2018",1,this company cannot be trusted,"this company cannot be trusted. I placed an order for next day delivery and it was a day late (with no warning)... It turns out my order was incomplete.. with THREE items out of the SIX I ordered not in my package.. ASOS are now reviewing my case and I‚Äôve had no updates. Not to mention Lewis who works in the call centre in Glasgow who lied to me over the phone. Jasmin and Nimo on online chat were nice but basically just told me to phone DPD (wasting more of my own time) and to suck it up and wait.. I honestly don‚Äôt know what has happened to ASOS recently, their customer service used to be spot on now they‚Äôre treating me like a criminal."

"November 04, 2018",1,Products stolen from order and no help,"I ordered a lot of make up through you (roughly ¬£100 worth) and it never arrived in my parcel. I provided photos showing that the parcel had been opened and then resealed by DPD but you still haven‚Äôt helped refund me or resend me the items. Originally you said you would come back to me after 5 working days, I then followed up and on the 5th working day and you said to leave it to the next day. I‚Äôve now followed up every single day since then and you keep repasting the same message stating you‚Äôll let me know when there‚Äôs an update. It‚Äôs now been nearly 2 weeks since I notified you of this and it‚Äôs really frustrating that you‚Äôre not sticking to your own deadlines or trying to help me in anyway at all. Typically I would expect with good customer service that you would refund or replace the items and then you can follow up with your partner DPD rather than waiting for a response from them before helping your customer. I regularly buy from ASOS and have been a customer for a number of years and I feel your level of service has significantly decreased over the last couple of years. I now find it very unreliable and also unhelpful when there‚Äôs a problem and would now find myself questioning whether I would recommend using your company due to the lack of care if anything goes wrong. I hope that I will receive some kind of suitable resolution to my recent order but to anyone reading this please think twice about whether you want to order from ASOS as this is not the only time this has happened."
"November 04, 2018",4,I am new to ASOS and read reviews here‚Ä¶,"I am new to ASOS and read reviews here before buying. I found the website easy to navigate maybe helped by knowing exactly what I wanted. As I had a discount code I was expecting an issue ( these codes either work or not and, if the latter, it is usually presumed that the customer is at fault. Rarely will the retailer admit to/accept the fault being theirs. But that‚Äôs another issue). WOW! The discount code was accepted and the ease of placing the order & paying raised a smile on my face. I got updates and the goods were received CAREFULLY & WELL PACKAGED and in pristine condition. The order price was competitive so that influenced my purchase. I like a good deal! My reason for 4 stars being that delivery was slower than competitors standard /free delivery, and the amount of card & paper in the parcel was unnecessary and expensively produced. Would be better to save money using a ‚Äòprint if needed‚Äô returns system and use savings to improve other areas or offer more customer discounts or plant a tree ( if you don‚Äôt do that already). Just a suggestion from an average customer ü§î I will buy again."
"November 04, 2018",5,Customer since the beginning of as seen‚Ä¶,"Customer since the beginning of as seen on screen I am satisfied with my purchases, customer service, returns and so on.But I'm aware that , although the offer is vast, the quality of ASOS made products leaves a lot to be desired. Of course you get what you paid for, cheap ! Also I find that Asos has lost its lustre by providing merchandise not so exciting as before, stuff that one can just find anywhere on line. I suggest that asos should hire streets ahead buyers, because going through the massive stuff on site, it's difficult to find something that stands out and worth buying, just me of course.  I lately got a pair of of Allsaints cigarette jeans, a winner. Thanx."
"November 04, 2018",5,ASOS is everything,ASOS is everything! I order from them at least 1x a month. I‚Äôve never had an issue and I love that they deliver so quickly and take returns. Thank you!
"November 03, 2018",1,Terrible,"Terrible, terrible customer service.  No number to call, just a ""chat"" that is spotty and completely unhelpful.  ""We'll get back to you with information on that inquiry in 72 hours.""  No!  Give me a phone number so I can TALK to someone!"
"November 03, 2018",1,Customer Service?,"Customer Service? What's that? I really don't know how ASOS choose to hire their staff. I've to explain a refund issue over and over again because the refund was made incorrectly in the first place by ASOS. It took over 45 minutes and in the end, Alina - ASOS Customer Service representative abruptly and rudely ended the chat because she couldn't help instead of referring the issue to a manager or someone that could have competently dealt with it. All that needed to be done is recognise that the wrong item was refunded against the wrong order number. How do you expect customers to come back when you hire customer service agents that don't understand their role to the general public? One of them is solving the issue and ensuring the customer is satisfied. POOR SERVICE ALL AROUND. Will not shop here again."

"November 02, 2018",1,"Shopped with Asos for years, expected more. Terrible.","I've been shopping with Asos for some years now, never had any issues before as I got what I ordered, got refunded for what I returned, etc. All was well. Recently however I had to deal with Asos customer service which is by far the worst I've ever dealt with online in the past 12+ years. If you have any other than general question, you're out of luck. You won't get any help from anyone, not via chat, emails, anything, you'll only get their general policies repeated until you give up. It's my most tiresome and insane experience with a shop, ever. Online or off. Long story:1. I order 2 items.2. The items arrive, I ask a question about the design via Asos Chat and I'm told I'd be getting contacted via email within the next 48 hours.3. I send back the 2 items.4. I get no answer to my question but instead, I get a shipping confirmation email. I log on to Asos and notice I've been shipped another one for no reason. I didn't order it, I didn't ask for it, someone just didn't read my question and sent me a new item. Even though in my original question about the design, I specified that I do not want this item.5. I contact Asos via chat about the order I didn't make, I'm told I won't be charged for this as I didn't place this order and will be refunded for the return shipping too (10.80‚Ç¨ from my country).6. I send back the unordered item. I ask Asos via chat if I could maybe get a replacement. I'm told Asos doesn't do replacements internationally, even though one had already been made without my consent that I had mentioned in this same chat.7. I get a refund for 1 item of the original order even though I returned 2. I contact Asos as I suspect my money's being held until the replacement is with Asos, too, and I'm told I should wait for 24 hours. I wait 24 hours, contact Asos, I'm told to wait another 24 hours. Turns out Asos is holding on to my money until the replacement is returned as expected, making me pay for the replacement after the fact.8. I contact Asos a via chat, always get different answers with employees now starting to get rude towards me and/or not reading or understanding my issue, eventually cutting me off.9. Asos' carrier is taking more time than before, not updating the unordered return package info at all .Other returns have been with Asos within a week with daily email updates and I've gotten my refund within a week from that. Now the package has been with Asos carrier for almost 3 weeks with a single update. Local post office records show it left the country 2 weeks ago.10. I contacted Asos carrier, reBOUND returns and was told the parcel is delayed due to adverse weather and assuring me the package is with the carrier. Been over a week since I contacted reBOUND returns, still no updates.In short, Asos made a mistake by not reading my original question. Instead they ignored it, started this mess by sending me something I didn't want that now their carrier apparently lost or something and Asos will just hold on to my money? Asos made a mistake and I pay for it.If it's a simple cheap order, feel free to place it. If you think there'll be any issues, you won't get any help. No one at Asos will hear you or treat you like a valued customer."
"November 02, 2018",2,Where is Good Old Asos?,"I was using their services for 7+ years, but recently the company has turned into complete crap. I see a lot of issues with their delivery... same happened to me multiple times. Whenever you are using any promo codes or vouchers, please, guys, everyone, read T&Cs very carefully. Their customer service staff are only polite when you have general enquiry, if you need more serious in depth answers they just do not respond to your questions on the chat.*Generally, look at how many items are out of stock?! Ridiculous.*Hardly anything new and interesting was added to the site lately.*They have faulty products with 10% discount. Come on, ASOS, if one customer sends the item back because there is a faulty, I do not think it is such a great idea to keep on displaying this item for the same price (for the next 3+ months...) and wait until some other guy buys it. *Look how outdated some of the things are! They keep on selling last and before last season items full price. Honestly, the only thing that is alright about them is Klarna. But do you need it when your items get lost or you cannot get a full refund? They even ended ASOS A-LIST! What are the incentives for shopping with them?"
"November 02, 2018",4,The yearly 9.99 next day delivery is so‚Ä¶,The yearly 9.99 next day delivery is so worth it. Easy returns policy too. Shame that they got rid of the asos A-List though!!!
"November 02, 2018",5,I don't understand how asos can get a‚Ä¶,"I don't understand how asos can get a bad review... I love asos! I've been ordering anything from clothes, to shoes, home decor and jewllery. The descriptions are thorough, you can see the product on the model in a video, you can zoom in the pics. Delivery doesn't take longer than a week and even if there's ever something wrong with your order - which happened to me twice in the past 7 years - they are extremely helpful. They do both refunds and replacements. Personally, I couldn't be happier with this retailer!"
"November 02, 2018",1,ASOS delivery system and customer service is TERRIBLE,"I am from Singapore and I have an asos package that should arrive on 26th October. I contacted them only on 2nd November when it still hasn't arrived - I WAITED AN ENTIRE WEEK ALREADY. Firstly, I waited for an hour and I still could not get on the live chats. I gave up and waited few hours later before trying again. Secondly, the customer service is slow and unhelpful. They do not provide me with any information that I actually need, all they do is tell me to wait till 5th November ""before they can help me further"". I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY CANT THEY HELP ME NOW? I ALREADY WAITED AN ENTIRE WEEK. Thirdly, ASOS stop working with my local postage service and this is the biggest problem --> there is NO tracking number provided and ASOS customer service do not know what the new courier is. I asked 2 of them MULTIPLE times and they just can't answer it. They just keep asking me to check with my local postage service when they do not even work w ASOS anymore. This isn't the first time I have problems ordering from asos. They have good quality and nice items. But order at your own risk, your parcel may not arrive at the date ASOS promised and they will do nothing about it but tell you to wait and just leaving the chat (if u can even get on one)."
"November 01, 2018",1,worst customer service I've ever experienced,"the second issue i had occurred when i placed an order that was lost by the carrier. the tracking notified me that the package was set to be delivered to me 2 days before my delivery date that ASOS advised. however, the carrier lost the package. when i contacted ASOS they told me that i still had to wait until it was THEIR delivery date before they would do anything about the issue. the customer service rep who was chatting with was completely rude and told me that i still needed to wait, even after i told her that the package was lost by the carrier so the point of having to wait seemed worthless. you would think that when a customers' package is lost they would just reship the item and cancel the lost the one but no. they are very dismissive and very unhelpful."
"November 01, 2018",1,AWFUL SERVICE,"If I could have given no stars I would. Never used them before this order and will never use again. Ordered two items on Monday and was advised delivery would be on the Thursday or before. This is when it started to go downhill. In the Wednesday I am told one item they cannot fulfil and have refunded my monies which could take two weeks!!!Thursday comes and the other item doesn‚Äôt turn up and Asos customer service don‚Äôt care, simply blame it on the delivery company Hermes. Will not be using this company ever again."
"November 01, 2018",5,Recommend Asos for everyone and everything :),"We buy from Asos few times a year, till now everything was perfect, they have very good stuff,  also some stuff that you cant buy in normal stores-limited edition clothes and shoes. One time i needed to return one jacket, and they have very easy returning link on their app, shipping back was free, and they returned money in time. So i recommend Asos for everyone and everything :)"
"November 01, 2018",5,Amazing :),"In my opinion, asos is the best online store ever. I'll admit that it can be quite expensive but the return policy is amazing. While returning an item you simply fill in the sheet of paper which comes with every delivery and can easily close the package again because of a glued stripe on the bag it comes in. Asos pays for the packaging that way and also for the delivery."
"November 01, 2018",1,Takes entirely too long to ship,Takes entirely too long to ship. They say 2-4 days but it's been over 10 days now. Needed my order for an event and was unable to have it for the evening.Edit: finally received my item after waiting a month AND they sent me 6 sizes too large. How does that even happen?
"November 01, 2018",1,Another ASOS failure,"If you value your health and sanity, you will avoid these bent crooks at all cost. ASOS and DPD are impossible to deal with. ASOS customer service is particularly crap, as you can read in many other reviews below."
"November 01, 2018",1,"I use to REALLY enjoy shopping here, things have defiantly changed.","I use to REALLY enjoy shopping here, this past order has been by far the absolute worse experince I have EVER experienced while shopping. I order one coat a single item around the very beginning of the month, it was expected to arrive around the 28th which was fine. I bought the item because I was going out of town and had no coat and was leaving the 1st of the following month. Well the expected date arives and behold no package. I contacted customer support and this is when it took a turn for the worst. They argued over and over for almost 20 minutes until finally saying we needed a extra day for shipping it will be there the 30th. Two days pass and still no package so I contact them again. And the proceed to continue to tell me oh the date of arival was changed now to the 31st. At this point I was frustrated and anxious since I was going to a new city with out a coat because I was relying on them. And asked the customer care lady ‚Äúit will ABSOLUTELY be here tomorrow right? No matter what you are tracking it and it will be here‚Äù and she told me yes. So the 31st comes usps has been to my house already and no package.  I contact ASOS again and they tell me the same thing ‚Äúwait till the end of the day it will be there by today‚Äù I explained usps has already been to my house and they proceeded to tell me to wait it will be there today and ended the chat on me before finishing the conversation. Here comes the big issue. Of course it didn‚Äôt arrive it‚Äôs now the 1st of next month I went out and bought something new in place of the jacket I planned to have. That morning I recived a email stating that my package JUST SHIPPED ALMOST 3 WEEKS LATER. I tried contacting customer support again. Not just about the package being gone, but now for the terrible customer support. He argued back and fourth for awhile he told me ‚Äúit‚Äôs now expected Nov. 06 wait until the end of the day, if it‚Äôs not there by Nov. 09 then we can look into it‚Äù although he acknowledged that it‚Äôs incredibly late. And offered me 4.99 back on the product and said look at our website for promo discounts in exchange for the bad customer support. I asked to speak to a supervisor or anyone able to help me since clearly this situation was above his capability but he refused and just like the last lady I spoke to closed the chat before meeting a resolution. Long story short WORST place to buy anything"
"November 01, 2018",1,Liars,"Liars - the company use underhanded tactics to get your money then don't deliver.Before i put my order in my delivery date was""tomorrow"" and once they had taken my money they changed it to a day later.No apology, no option to cancel and no option to refund. I have a funeral in a couple of hours and have nothing to wear due to this bunch of monkeys.Company like ASOS s*** on consumers like you and me daily, and see them as powerless in comparison to themselves. They should not be allowed to operate with todays standards. They shouldn't even be allowed to operate a market stall."

During the day i received an email informing me that the item had been delivered back to ASOS and would take 7 days to be delivered to me (I had already paid ¬£10 for next day delivery)Customer service was useless and kept quoting ASOS policy.  I asked for a refund and was told that it would take 7 days.ASOS should value their customers, their customer service service is terrible, you can only communicate via email. Do not shop here unless you value frustration and bad service"

"October 31, 2018",1,This is a rubbish company,"This is a rubbish company. Although not a customer, I received a parcel from them with wrong addressee but correct house and street. DPD asked ASOS if they would authorise collection and return but they refused and requested that I contact ASOS direct. I did so and was told to open the package, use the return label, and return it to them, presumably via Royal Mail. I refused to be responsible for opening someone else‚Äôs package and suggested that they contacted their client who might live nearby and might be prepared to uplift. This was rejected as they could not access their account under data protection rules! They even refused to take my phone number. I still have the package which is now heading for the rubbish bin.  I certainly will not become a customer of ASOS."
"October 31, 2018",1,I really would not recommend to order from ASOS.COM,"I really would not recommend to order from Asos.com. Their customer service is the worst of any I have encountered. I have ordered a big order and after few days I received an e-mail that my order is delivered. BUT it was it TOTALLY DIFFERENT CITY. After double checking address which i wrote down in order, confirmation letters from ASOS and contacting delivery company I realized that it was ASOS mistake. After that I contacted ASOS with all evidence, that it was their mistake.  We had a long conversation, but after all evidence and my honest request for help they did not admitted, that it was even a mistake! They offered me to go pick a package by myself from totally different town (which would cost me my time and money to get there). Or just wait, at least 10 days, for the package to be sent back to them and get my money back after at least another 14 days and if I still will want the goods to order it again (if it still will be available). So if you value your time, money and nerves don't order from ASOS.com"
"October 31, 2018",1,"Hello,","Hello,I would not recommend to order from this E-shop now days... Their customer service seems to be trolling and messing around with its customers.

But I have noticed, that the package is in totally different city [120km away]. I have contacted ASOS if they could fix this and WOW did not expect that coming.They have said that they can not do anything and they are sure it is not their fault, then they directed me to the delivery company. I have contacted them - they actually have sent me all the documentation that they have received from ASOS, with exact proof of ASOS sending the order to wrong post adress. [instead of 9000 post code --> 8900]. I have attached all this information and re-send to ASOS. Nor they have offered any viable solution, nor they have admitted their mistake and offered to wait for 10 days, for the package to be sent back to them. And then the refund process would be done within 10 days, by me paying the ""delivery cost""... And I just wanted to receive the goods by spotting their obvious mistake. [since I do not like conflicts I used my own money to get to the town to pick up the package...] Moral --> if you do not have a car, think twice before ordering from these rednecks. Good luck!"
"October 31, 2018",1,ASOS & DPD terrible customer service,I bought premium delivery from ASOS and purchased a two pairs of chinos. DPD (ASOS courier) then delivered my parcel to my billing address instead of my delivery address. DPD refuses to amend the addresss and advisers they could deliver to a shop. ASOS said I could purchase another set and be refunded for the first set once they had recieved them back from DPD.ASOS refuses to send a new set out at their expense awaiting the pair to be returned by their incompetent courier. In my advice do not use either of these companies as their customer service is non-exaistant. A simple fix would have been to:A) send the item to the correct address to start B) send it to the correct address when I had told me they had sent to the wrong one.C) send me a new set at your expense (not mine) and receive back your parcel from your incompetent courier.

Nobody concacted me. I wrote to asos again  to find out I need to wait another 48h. Then another 48h. Then another 48h. Also one advisor just turned of chat when I still had questions!

Got told to take my faulty, ripped dress (which I had bought for a wedding) to a clothing repair shop at my own expense! On another occasion when my item didn‚Äôt arrive (I had paid extra for next day delivery as I needed it) I was told to keep waiting and come back another day. Not good enough. Shocking service."

Upon checking the tracking next day there was a problem saying Hermes had a few problems and put the order back 48 hours. On checking again it then said that it couldnt deliver to that address. I have every order delivered to that address with no problems for years. Asos customer service was terrible. I emailed them 5 times and all they came back with is "" click here for tracking"" and ""click here for Hermes chat"". Chat wait was from 40 mins to a few hours. Asos could not give me a reason why the parcel was delayed. They then told me I would have to wait another 7 days for the parcel.  A day later Hermes replied to an email i sent them telling me they were sending the parcel back to Asos. I then emailed Asos who then said they were going to refund me. I stated i didnt want a refund I wanted my order. So now the item is out of stock in my size. An absolutely terrible shopping experience and poor customer service. No effort was made to find put why they couldn't deliver, they just fob you off. I pay for a service that they cant fulfil."

Informed I needed to wait an additional 4 days for it to be delivered, which it wasn‚Äôt. Requested a refund which was provided, but no explanation was given at all. Then to my horror the exact same thing happened again exactly a week later. Contacted ASOS after 10pm and was told to send another email if parcel is not delivered by 12am!!!! On the first occasion I was informed these things happen occasionally, but two times in the space of a week.  My biggest issue is the scripted responses from Customer Service, with no explanation as to why this has happened or what they plan to do.  Neither do ther offer any form of goodwill gesture for the inconvenience caused to their customers.I have never had issues with ASOS previously, but it seems the company is no longer reliable so I will not be shopping on the site anymore."
"October 29, 2018",1,Returned an item and no refund/exchange,"Ordered 4 items from them a few weeks ago and they sent me the wrong size for some trousers. I sent them back for an exchange the next day and forgot I even sent them until about 6 days later as I had not even received an email to say they had received them. I spoke to someone on chat and they said they had received it but advised me to wait another day as it was 7 working days processing time for a refund/exchange. I waited another 4 working days and still had not heard anything. I messaged them again yesterday and they said this has been escalated to another team and would once again take another 24hrs. I‚Äôm under the impression they had lost the trousers I had returned or someone in their warehouse messed up. At this point I was fuming and I wasn‚Äôt given any explanation, just told to wait, wait, wait. Once again I messaged them noon 24hrs later and explained the situation a third time. The girl I was speaking to said no one got back to me as there had been ‚Äútech issues‚Äù but she still could not tell me where/what had happened to my return. Once again told to wait longer and she can‚Äôt do anything. I waited a few more hours and still nothing. Then I chatted with the worst customer service employee I‚Äôve ever had to deal with, George. He didn‚Äôt care and once again I had to explain myself. He said I had to wait until the end of the day. As it was Sunday, I asked when as I didn‚Äôt know they worked 24hrs. I got a condescending reply that the end of the day means midnight as if I was a fool. I told him if I didn‚Äôt get an email by then I would charge it back on my card as this was getting ridiculous now. As I was chatting with him I send the chat log to my email to keep a record of it and closed the chat. A few minutes later I recieved an email with the chat log and after I closed the chat he replied with ‚Äú ok, no problem. If that‚Äôs all then close the chat‚Äù. There was no apology no nothing. Just a juvenile response from a sad childish person. Midnight came and no email. Before I callled my card company I gave them one more chance. I explained the situation again and was told by the girl that I would be getting an exchange and not a refund and that the order will be with me tomrrow, 30mins later I receive an email saying my order will be with me in 2 days, there‚Äôs no tracking information or anything and I won‚Äôt even be at home to receive it as I‚Äôll be at work on that day. I‚Äôve received no email before then and now I‚Äôll be unable to receive the trousers that I‚Äôve paid for almost 3 weeks ago now as I‚Äôll be at work and all this because of their mistake/lack of communication. After spending ¬£600 this month on ASOS I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be spending my money there again."

They're already 2 days late - you'd think they would want to do something about that but apparently they don't care. Meanwhile, over ¬£400 of my belongings are sat somewhere in Wembley according to my tracking information with no explanation! So either ASOS think it's ok for couriers to steal people's orders, or they think it's ok for couriers to do whatever they like with your stuff for 4-5 days before they actually give you your order! Either one...ridiculous!"

I made an order of 9 items last week and out of 9 items today I received 6 so 3 of the items were missing.I contacted customer service and as usual found a rude person where I was offered no apology and was told that I have to wait another 24 hours for them to get in touch with me about my missing items, items which I have already paid for!!When I told the person (someone with the name of Redmond) on the chat service that this was unacceptable he simply dismissed my comment and told me if that was all I was free to close the chat.  How condescending to say the least.  When I opened one of the dresses that I had ordered, not only is it different to the picture I saw online but it was packed with the zipper fully open on the back of the dress and sent to me in a state which seemed that someone had just tried it on and stuffed it back in the plastic bag it came in.  They never even bothered to repack it neatly before sending it to another buyer which to me now looks very obvious that it has already been worn.What a horrible service.  Never again Asos, never again!!"

Bought a dress for a wedding, when it arrived they had sent the wrong item, Unfortunately these things do happened and so I wasnt too worried. Customer service was really helpful, spoke with a lady called Magdalena who was apologetic and got this sorted right away. They sent my replacement on next day delivery, I have just opened this and again the incorrect dress leaving me with 1 day to (of which I am working) to find a dress. I contacted again and spoke with Keenan who didnt even say sorry. I am not someone who complains at all, in fact this is the first complaint I have ever made online. I understand they need to go through processes and this cant be helped, but maybe take note that a simple sorry can go along way."

"October 25, 2018",1,No Delivery Attempt & Terrible CS,"Having placed an order and paid for express delivery, I took the day off work so that I could be in to received the item (someone else is also off today so there are two of us in the house). I heard the DPD van pull up and looked out the window to confirm it was DPD, I saw the driver get out the van and so I went downstairs to be near the front door, however in the 15 seconds it took me to get downstairs, the driver was back in his van and driving off. At no point did he try ring the doorbell or knock on the door.I have since been in touch with ASOS on messenger and live chat, both of which displayed terrible examples of customer service. The agent on live chat actually ended the chat when I asked to what their escalation process was as this was an urgent order needed for tomorrow. I have now had to pay an extra ¬£10 through DPD to get my order before I go to work tomorrow.Overall a terrible experience from the driver to the customer service team.

"October 23, 2018",1,Terrible customer service and overall‚Ä¶,"Terrible customer service and overall just disappointed in ASOS leadership. As several others have stated, their customer service team does not care at all about your experience, they are short and indifferent. I had an order that was supposed to come on or before the 22nd, when I reached out the next day to inquire about the missing order they told me it may arrive on or before the 31st, I explained how frustrating this is as that is 10+ days delayed and they said, ""out of our control"", when I asked if I could speak to their manager, a woman named Ama said, ""we are all one big team, there is not manager"" (this was definitely a copy and paste job) and then she terminated the chat without asking me if there was anything else she could do, I reopened my chat with someone named Matt to let him know that, first off - I know this isn't directly their fault, that I respect them and would like to be treated with respect in return, I told him I was upset that Ama hung up on me and I asked him if his organization believes this is an OK way to treat their customers, he gave me an indirect response saying Ama was right that there's nothing they can do and that if she feels there's nothing more to add she can terminate the chat...I told him I hope he's proud of that decision. It is honestly sad because I advise organizations for a living and I know the people in customer support are probably treated terribly and hate their jobs. As rude as they were, I don't blame them I blame the executives who don't make them a priority or instill respect as one of their core values. Very disappointed in ASOS."

Wrong, they then went onto say it would not be honoured to me, and quite frankly after the really rude customer service I received I said ok, you have now lost a loyal customer"

"October 23, 2018",1,The worst experience I have ever had,"The worst experience I have ever had, shopping online!I'm a Danish citizen, currently located in Russian for study.I bought some brown boat shoes, and receiving them was not a problem, infact I had no problems getting them. But the shoes were too small, and I have to send them back. Usually there are free returns from Russian using Boxberry, but Boxberry is a Russian company, and to return a package, I have to upload my passport on their website for confirmation purposes. But the problem is that, they only accept passports from slavic countries! Leaving me in the worst nightmare ever.I have been contacting alot of people on ASOS' chat, seeking help. Firstly I spoke with a person named Connor, telling me to try call Boxberry, and he sent the case to their Russian department, so I received a mail later. Really no help!Then I tried to get help from two Russian friends (both native!) I went to the physical boxberry post-office, and have been calling them by phone. I even tried filling out the boxberry website form, using my friends' passports. Still no luck!When I contact ASOS again, I get to speak with a person named Rhys, which were really Rude, and I told how fustrating this situation was.And I was once again refered to the Russian team, but I told Rhys, that I had already been in contact with them, and it didn't help, and I further asked if there was something else that could be done.Rhys replied, no... and if I didn't have anything else to say, I should just close the window!I still haven't sent the package, and the 28 days (the frame for sending back the package) are almost up. It feels like a business strategy from ASOS' side. It looks good on the website with all this ""FREE RETURNS"" and what ever, but when you need it, it's not gonna be easy.Just to warn people, never buy clothes from ASOS, if you are located in Russia, and don't have russian citizenship. Because ASOS won't help you!"

I Complained to the customer service and they told me they couldn‚Äôt do anything about it. Instead, I‚Äôd have to send it back and get a refund. However, I was not to be refunded for the next day delivery which was rather annoying considering it was because of the fault that it had to be sent back at all. Although this experience was very bad I have had countless other experiences that have been the complete opposite.

They refunded me for the 3 and sent out a replacement for the 4th. The exact same thing happened with delivery again and I still hadn't received any items. I contacted ASOS again, and a 3rd attempt was made. Luckily I received this one. The first two deliverys were made by HERMES and the 3rd by DPD. I know the blame is on the delivery driver, however these are the people that ASOS choose to represent them and it all falls back on them. Ultimately i've been left with only 1 of 4 items I originally ordered. This was my first time buying from ASOS and it's left me weary from buying from them again. Diasspointed to say the least."

It's basically taking longer with Premier Delivery now than what Standard Delivery took 1 year ago.My last order I made 8 days ago with Premier Delivery has still not arrived. It has been stuck at the same step since Monday.Not going to order anything from Asos untill they sort their mess out.
"October 18, 2018",5,Very happy with the service,Very happy with the service. It was my first order from Asos. Replay touch super high rise skinny pink jeans which I have ordered looks the same as on the pictures or video on the asos website. Jeans are very comfortable and beautiful pale pink colour.I might admit that fit assistance on this website is very helpfulDelivery was even quicker than expected.Def 5 stars and I will buy from Asos again. Well done
"October 18, 2018",1,The WORST customer service!!,The WORST customer service I've ever experienced. Never shopping at ASOS again.
"October 18, 2018",5,My personal review,"My personal review - Asos 5 stars.Maybe you think this is not right as their reputation is overall under 3 stars, but in my opinnion their products are legit, their deliver is super-fast and comunication online is nice and quick. I made order from Croatia from UK version of Asos and got my items delivered under 3 days with free postage. I ordered Lacoste product that was 20% cheaper then in Croatia and item was 100% original."
"October 17, 2018",1,Awful experience,"ASOS used to be good. I'm not sure what happened, but the company has definitely gone downhill! I was meant to receive my parcel two weeks ago, which the courier had lost. Now, I am waiting for ASOS to reply back to me about my refund, which will probably take another two weeks. Their customer service is slow and responses are robotic."
"October 17, 2018",1,Delivery always late and inefficient Customer Care,"I have a Premium account, but my deliveries are always late (take 3 or 4 days, instead of 1), arrive at the wrong place or get even lost. I contacted the Customer Care several times, each time a disaster because no one is willing to help and solve the problem. Please find a better shipment service and improve the quality of your Customer Service!"
"October 16, 2018",1,I ordered a bag,"I ordered a bag, I got shoes. I now have to wait 72 hours just so a ‚Äúspecialist‚Äù can tell me how to make a return. Complete joke. I pay a premium for next day delivery. They have my money, I have no bag. The customer service chat function is shockingly bad at providing good service."
"October 16, 2018",1,Fraudulent activity!,"Just had a similar situation to others on this site.My husband ordered a parcel for next day delivery but it never arrived. Spoke to ASOS customer service who advised it should be with you soon as there was an issue with the courier (not an acceptable excuse as had paid for next day delivery) but by this point my husbands birthday had come and gone so he just thought he would wait. Finally today he got a message to say the parcel had arrived, he went to his local collect plus only to find the package had been opened and all the clothes stolen but only a shoebox had been left inside and resealed. My husband had paid with a credit card so he cancelled the payment straight away and told ASOS. As others have said the ‚Äúmanager‚Äù is never available to talk???. Definitely some fraudulent activity going on here and we will be taking it further!"
"October 16, 2018",1,Worst store I‚Äôve ever seen,Worst store I‚Äôve ever seen. They still owe me $127 from a refund. They basically are thieves. DO NOT ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE.
"October 16, 2018",1,Absolutely WORST customer service,"Absolutely appalling customer service, they don't care about you at all, the customer service cannot provide any help with all your enquiries, all you get is model answers like sorry but this can't be done, that can't be done, it is out of their reach etc... AVOID AT ALL COSTS please, fuming after having 2 chats with them and they reply so so slow as if they don't value you as a customer, shop at other places please,  I bet Zalando has better service and offers than ASOS. Already closed my account and won't be looking at it anymore."

"October 16, 2018",1,"Absolutely terrible service, ASOS refuse to help.","Absolutely terrible service. ASOS are fine except when something goes wrong. When something goes wrong, they do everything they can to wriggle out of resolving the issue and refuse to help you. I have an item due to be delivered before 11th October. To this date, it has still not arrived. It was sent via Hermes. ASOS told me to contact them regarding the missing item. When I did, they tell me they won't help me and to email them back on the 22nd October. I have asked them multiple times to contact their carrier (hermes) in order to trace the item, as the tracking has not updated since October 11th. They told me they cannot get in touch with their courier. I have asked to make a formal complaint, they refused to provide me the information to do so. I asked to escalate my complaint, I was told it would be investigated by a 'specialist care team' and I would be contacted. The 'specialist care team' doesn't exist, and all i got back was an email that was copy and paste the exact same words. This company are a disgrace, and I will be taking this complaint as far as I can take it. At this point they have my money and have not supplied the item, and this is theft."
"October 16, 2018",5,Great service,"I have ordered twice from ASOS and I only have excellent experiences and words to share about. Excellent service,it came before estimated time. I recommend everyone this site. Thank you again :)"
"October 15, 2018",5,Never had any problems,I literally always buy my clothes from ASOS and I've never had problems they always arrived within a week and sizes are always correct
"October 15, 2018",1,Thanks for THE amazing service ASOS. LOL,"I ordered my items a week (working days) before that I need them, and I did get them on time, but of course them sent me the wrong item. I had a talk with one online customer service for the issue and I expect an express delivery since I actually need them by day after tomorrow. And she told me that she cannot give me the express delivery and she will pass on the issue to the specialist team that takes up to 72 hours to respond (and she knows I need all the items by day after tomorrow). Thank you for the great service and making customers to facing such an inconvenient and awkward situation BECAUSE YOU CANT EVEN OFFER AN EXPRESS DELIVERY!!!"

"October 13, 2018",1,If I could have given it a zero I‚Ä¶,"If I could have given it a zero I would. Dreadful customer service. Every order I have had problems with. They have sent me incorrect items with the right code on the packaging. I am still waiting for a refund on these itemsI have spent literally hours on their chat lines and they could not care less about customer service. I have yet to receive any help from them and they will not talk to you directly and just end ‚Äúon line‚Äù chat . They refuse to telephone you or refer you to somebody who may help. Deliveries always delayed, items then wrong and they take no responsibility for their agent couriers. Nor will they share details of their courier service with you. I will NEVER purchase from them again and urge the brands they sell to consider the negative impact that ASOS is creating for their brands."
"October 13, 2018",1,Stole my money,"October 13th Had the nerve to say they couldn't find my order when I sent the lady the order number through the online customer service chat bs!!!! Didn't send a pair of my shoes... Told me she handed it over to the specialist who will email me in 48 hours... I'm not dumb, I know it'll never happen... I'm so upset I want to cry. SCAMMERS. Do yourself a favor & shop else where.UPDATE: October 16thI filed a claim with the Better Business Bureau & the same day the BBB sent my complaint to ASOS, I received an email saying that they sent me a ""replacement"" item. Boom, just like that. It was sent through overnight express shipping & everything. My advice, go above their heads & file a claim... That was totally what helped me 100% because it was just too ironic after being given the run around like every one else... But not too many people take the time to file a claim, if you want your items or money, that's the way to go in my opinion. Not gonna say the issue was resolved until I actually get the item & everything is all good, until then, the claim will still be out against them publicly."

"October 13, 2018",1,Absolutely atrocious!,"Absolutely atrocious!! I ordered a jumper and jeans 2 weeks ago, received an email last Saturday stating that my items had been despatched and I‚Äôd have my item by Tuesday. When nothing arrived, I contacted ASOS to be told that my items were out of stock?!?! Funny how I was able to order both and strange that both are now out of stock. When I asked for further answers as to why, I was told there was an issue with my order leaving the warehouse and I would receive my refund in 10-15 working days!!?!? Great so I go away Monday and don‚Äôt have money or clothes to go away with. I asked for my complaint to be escalated and was told no. Absolutely shocking!! How are you allowed to treat your customers this way! Totally unacceptable! You‚Äôve had my money for 4 weeks and I‚Äôve had nothing but grief...oh and forgot to add I had to chase my order, we‚Äôre ASOS at any point going to notify me. Sort it out ASOS"

I am not happy about this not only has it ruined my brothers birthday gift I know have to wait 7 days or more to get my money back for something I have not had / got . I will be taking this further"
"October 12, 2018",1,Non existent customer care,Non existent customer care I am so disappointed that I handed over money to this company. I so wished that I had ordered what I needed from Debenhams who had the exact same things. I chose Asos and what a regret. When you are told it is going to be delivered by a certain date you trust in that. I needed these items for the day after delivery. One item was a swimming costume and I wanted to start swimming asap as currently pregnant. When I tell them that I either want the order for the following day or will be forced to return everything as soon as I receive it as I will have to buy the items AGAIN elsewhere!!! But they did not care. The order was due to be delivered 12/10 and they told me they could not do anything until 23rd October. I will not tolerate the fact that this company will not go above and beyond for their customers. They will not rectify mistakes. And they could not care less If you return your items. I will certainly never be ordering from them again.

I ordered an item and for the second day running the courier company Hermes said they tried to deliver and I was not in - the delivery is to my office which is open all day, so they are blatantly lying!  I now have no top to wear to the American football match I am going to this weekend and I have to go through the process of getting my money back.  I am guessing they will throw the item through the open office door next week when I no longer need it.  Problem with these online things are you cannot contact anyone or they will not get back to you... Have never had any problems in the past with getting items delivered"

"October 12, 2018",3,"Great clothes, if you get them.","I went scouring the internet for good plus size clothes that also wouldn't break the bank and came across ASOS. They had a very good assortment so I went ahead and bought five items. I soon get a notification that my order has shipped, but after that, radio silence for about five days and the tracking was showing nothing. Then, the day after the items were supposed to arrive, I receive an e-mail from paypal that I had gotten a partial refund and was confused, because ASOS had said nothing about some of my items being out of stock or anything. So I went to their customer service and chatted with a very helpful employee who quickly told me they had sent my items to the wrong person, and two of the items I had ordered had gone out of stock in the meantime, which sucked. I would have liked the option of choosing another size before they just straight up removed the items, but oh well.The items I received were fine, but naturally the stuff I was most excited about was missing.I don't know if I will order here again, but the customer service was great."

Forget about size 2 shoes. Trousers are even harder to find because of my hip to waist ratio.I can't recommend ASOS enough. I can order a bunch of clothes to try on that I can pay for in about a months time and if I don't like them I can return them quite easily and they take off the difference from the amount I have to pay. At the end of the day it's almost no different from trying on clothes in a store. First time I ever used them I returned the clothes outside of the 28 days window and they still refunded me. I didn't even have to ask, they just emailed me to acknowledge I've sent them late but they were happy to refund me.I know many people don't feel compelled to leave a review unless they've had a bad experience with a company, which is why I think positive feedback is also important."
"October 10, 2018",5,I usually have positive experiences‚Ä¶,"I usually have positive experiences with Asos - when there‚Äôs a problem, they help and mostly it‚Äôs really out of their hands, but they always solve the problems! This time really went out beyond my expectations. I ordered some sweaters and the day after I recieved them, I tried them on. Unfortunetely one of them, my favorite, had a little tear in the sleeve. If I can fix it, I usually just ask for some money back instead of returning it and the clothing going to waste, so I asked them if this would be possible. No, absolutely not. I was told they were very sorry and not to worry, they had already arranged for a new sweater to be sent to me and not to return the faulty one (they even asked if possible, if I would please dispose of it in the most environment friendly manner I could). I just have to step back and applaud Asos for their extreme serviceminded people and how they handled this. They were all very kind and professionel. Asos truly is my favorite place to shop! Now more than ever."

I called costumer service right away, they told me he could come back to the right door at the end of his shift so I had to stay in waiting that night, which I did. (But what about my job or classes? Hence why I booked that hour slot.)However, he did not show. He came the next day with the wrong order. I had ordered shoes and he gave me a jacket. Now I have no chance of getting the shoes in time for the wedding so I had to myself go to the post office to send back the jacket and ask for my money back. Taking two days of my time which I could have spent finding other shoes."

That too I live in Dubai and the item estimated delivery date was on or before the 11th. I received it 2 days earlier. The tracking mechanism was spot on and no issues there. Moreover, the product was perfect as ordered + the prices on Asos are a steal. Especially if you compare it with the prices in Dubai here. Almost 50% less. Would highly recommend shopping from Asos. Lets see, I will place a second order and hopefully no mess ups."
"October 09, 2018",5,I would recommend Asos any day,"Interestingly - in the mirror of other comments - I had no significant issue with Asos during my 4-5 orders.

After 3 solid years, and likely thousands of dollars later, I tried to return an order worth around $100. A month later, I still had no return notice or refund. I reached out to their customer service chat. They were so rude and dismissive and told me there was nothing they could do since I used a UPS drop box location, therefore I didn't have a tracking number. Please note that this is what i had ALWAYS done. After taking a few other customer service routes, and receiving the same response, I had to give up and was out $100. UPS also cannot help me since ASOS won't tell me the tracking number that is on the pre-printed label from ASOS. I obviously don't have it since it is on the package. Just a truly appalling experience after so many positive transactions. However, I cannot continue to give me business to them after this."

"October 07, 2018",1,ASOS is a scam,"Because ASOS is such a big company and has so many influencers promoting them, it‚Äôs easy to trust the site. But essentially they‚Äôre a scam. The item quality is rarely what‚Äôs advertised. So trust me, at least some of the items you‚Äôll want to return. ASOS always advertises their easy return system, but it‚Äôs never easy. They don‚Äôt keep you updated on the return process so even when it‚Äôs returned and processed on their part, you won‚Äôt get any notifications or actual refund. And when you reach out to the company, it‚Äôs likely they‚Äôll only give you a portion of the refund or none at all. I highly recommend everyone steer clear of this company. All you‚Äôll hear is good from influencers because they‚Äôre being sponsored. Listen to the real reviews."
"October 07, 2018",1,Bad customer service,I paid extra to have my parcel delivered on a day and time to suit me because of work only to receive an email after the time they were supposed to deliver stating that I had rearranged delivery! I contacted customer services who said that the parcel company had tried to deliver to the wrong address and now delivery couldn't be made so had to be rearranged for another day.Total waste of money paying for timed and dated delivery. Customer services were useless no help at all. At first they implied I was lying about being in!!!! Dreadful company.

First the delivery was delayed and when i reached out they advised me the package was delayed with the carrier and would be delivered on 10/5 by 8pm- unacceptable since I had to get the pants taken in. Luckily they did come 2 days after the original track date and we were able to wear them without tailoring. HOWEVER on the way to take pictures for homecoming I noticed the back of the pants were completely frayed. They just continued to get worse as the night went on. I‚Äôm so disappointed in the quality of these pants for the price I paid. My intention was to send my son to his first homecoming experience feeling and looking classy and instead he was made to feel insecure and cheap. I will never shop here again. I hope come Monday morning when I call they at least offer to refund my money.

"October 06, 2018",5,Asos is always my go to shop,Asos is always my go to shop and I purchase from them on at least a monthly basis! I pay a one off charge for unlimited next day delivery (which I have done for 3 years) and have never once had an issue or delay with my items! On the rare occasion that I have had to return an item the process is always free and refunds are as fast as can be expected. I would recommended to anybody üòå
"October 06, 2018",1,Terrible service from ASOS and Hermes,"I selected next day delivery because I knew I would be in. It was delayed from 1-3pm to 5-7pm and then Hermes stated on there tracker that an attempt was made to deliver it which was not correct at all as there was no attempt in delivering my parcel. ASOS‚Äô customer service team basically said I was lying and that I was not in all day and that they ‚Äúhave to go off the tracking‚Äù. Actually I was in all day and had to change my plans when it was first delayed.  I work in retail so I know that the customer is not always right but I‚Äôm this case I was.There next response was that there was ‚Äúdelay with our carrier, please allow until the end of the day on 11th October for your order‚Äù which is 6 days after expected delivery day !! For a company this size to offer no solution is absolutely shocking and to make out if I was lying is not a company I want to buy from."
"October 06, 2018",4,Not bad,"I bought  from ASOS 2 times, the first time all ok, the second time I got the parcel in a few days but I got problems to send back the goods. I solved my problem after 25 days. I suggest the store."
"October 06, 2018",5,I love Asos,Omg. Why so many negative comments? I order 3-4 times per year from them for almost 3 years now and never had an issue! Only once that i had to question something they answered within a day. Shipping is always on time and some days is faster without choosing express delivery. Quality of clothes vary but the product details and the catwalk videos helps you to understand the quality better. 2-3 times that i had to send something back they refund me immediately they received it. The best is that returns are free. Thank you Asos for the great customer service!
"October 05, 2018",5,Despite the comments,"Despite the comments, I actually like ASOS. I have shopped from them several times. They always have a variety of options to choose from. I always received orders on time. No problems with returns if needed. I guess they need to improve their customer service."
"October 04, 2018",1,Disgusting Customer Service!!,"Disgusting Customer Service!!I have never experiences anything like it! When speaking to them you get the feeling they do not even intend to help you and you get passed on from one useless person to another. After having so many issues of this year with them there is no way I will ever shop at Asos again!- Paid for premium delivery: They took my money, but it has never been activated! Customer Service tells me everyday for the last month they will look into it but NOTHING has happened- my student discount doesn't work anymore for some reason: they tell me to wait until my card expired and I apply for a new one... MY CARD EXPIRES IN 2 YEARS! The customer service at Asos literally ruins the whole shopping experience and therefore I would not recommend anyone to shop there"
"October 04, 2018",1,Consistently terrible,"Asos are not just terrible for customer service on random incidents, they have been consistently appalling over years. And it seems to be getting worse. They deserve to go bust."
"October 04, 2018",1,Messed up my order and denied to do anything about it.,I ordered six items and then I get an email saying that 2 of those 6 items were out of stock but they already sent out the other four. I contacted a chat customer service where the employee told me that one of those items actually is in stock but he can't do anything about it because they already sent the other stuff and that I just had to make another order if I wanted it ?? So because of the company's mistake the customer has to order again and pay for another shipment and custom fee? There was nothing he would do to reimburse me in any way. Not even offer a free shipment or discount/giftcard knowing that the customer is loosing money either way because of a mistake that they made.
"October 04, 2018",1,"ASOS, Aka a bunch of a**holes.","Never received my package. Reached out to them via email, and then I never got a response until I used the instant chat option. 'Martin' claimed that an email had been sent telling me that they had to send a new package and many of the items I ordered were out of stock and they were going to refund me...lets see if that package ever comes and better yet, if I even receive my refund, since they can't even seem to deliver an email.I've never had such bad service from them, as I've been a loyal customer for a few years now."
"October 03, 2018",1,suggested using pay later/credit to correct their mistake,Sent me complete different substitute items in the wrong size twice when my order was out of stock to enable them to still take my money. They then denied it happened and claimed it was just a mistake...which conveniently happened twice? Customer care useless and just sent out generic ‚Äòplease return this item and we can refund it‚Äô responses. Didn‚Äôt actually address the fact I have to be incovienced and out of pocket for at least 10 days because they clearly have a policy of substituting out of stock would items. When I pointed out that I would be ¬£95 out of pocket for at least ten days they suggested using their credit/pay later option to order something else from them!

It was creased so much and the horrible fact that a Starbucks receipt from Preston fisher gate! I live two hours away!!!!! It was in the coat pocket when I put it on, made me feel so disgusted, this put me in full inspection mode and as I had another person with me they confirmed it didn‚Äôt have that factory or neutral scent that clothings come in. I contacted customer service and all they could say is send it back and you‚Äôll receive a refund. I previously had a faulty item sent to me last year which they resolved but I ended up with a hole in my boots months later. Never the less I gave ASOS another chance but now they‚Äôre telling me they‚Äôre sorry and they inspect every product before sending it out but on this occasion they let it slip. Like okay, but why am I not getting a proper explanation or other ways to resolve this instead of me sending it back and being out of pocket or without a coat to wear for autumn? I honestly feel that they are trying to get me to send it back so they can put it back on stock( someone will definitely buy it ASAP) so they can send a worn coat to them. I asked for a discount and all they said was they couldn‚Äôt do it as I‚Äôve already purchased it. It‚Äôs really shocking to me to receive this king of behaviour from a big company! I actually asked them if I could speak to the manager and they said they wasn‚Äôt able to get a hold. Avoid and go to a company that actually feels liable if something occurs ! Missguided is the best so I will be sticking to that"
"October 03, 2018",1,Next day delivery,"Paid for next day delivery for the year... had numerous orders and never once received next day delivery... tried requesting a refund, all I got was excuses and the customer service staff just blamed it all on the couriers. Bad bad bad customer service."
"October 03, 2018",1,Save your money its not worth shopping here!,"I ordered multiple items from this site and most were cheap. I sent back a pair of shoes and this jewelry box that almost broke as soon as I opened it. I sent back my package and never got a refund. When I went to find out the status of my return no one could help. I gave them my name, address, email, and even the card that was charged but nothing they say they can't find my order.  So not only am I out $30 but one of the baskets I decided to ""tryout"" and keep broke within a month. Do not shop here!"

"October 03, 2018",1,Rude staff and terrible processes,"I placed an order on their click and collect next day delivery midday on the 1st of October, I shelled out ¬£6 for this service and now, the 3rd of October they tell me I have to wait till the 8th to receive my clothes! Not only that but I can't be refunded my delivery fee, they won't cancel the order, they refuse to contact Doddle about getting it returned back to them so I can be refunded. So I'm out of pocket for clothes I no longer need and they expect me to wait a week for a delivery that may not even happen, and then RETURN to get my money back. Absolutely shocking service, the advisor Sophie was patronising and no help at all, didn't even offer any form of goodwill as I honestly would wait and do that if they just showed some understanding. But no, all I got was canned responses and no accountability.They're good for cheap end of line items but if anything goes wrong you're up **** creek."
"October 03, 2018",1,I have been a customer of ASOS for‚Ä¶,"I have been a customer of ASOS for years. They used to be great, but something appears to have happened in the last 6 months. I had one delivery never turn up on the requested date and ASOS tried to blame me, stating I missed the deliver (I did not) - when it did eventually turned up, the carrier told me they never even attempted a delivery on the original date. I informed ASOS of this and they denied all knowledge - even with the back up of the carrier. I am now having another issue with a next day delivery that is over a week late; I keep being fobbed off. Apparently, there is a delay on the delivery, however I was never informed (surely, a basic element of customer service) and when I enquired as to why I was treated rudely. The customer service and delivery has become appalling which is so disappointing."

"October 02, 2018",1,The worst customer experience ever,"The worst customer experience I've ever had. They put me through a nightmare of trying to arrange collections through their partner company, Hermes. This took repeated tries, many conversations with both companies and a huge amount of my time wasted. When I gave up and returned the items using another means, they failed to send me an email confirming the refund for some of the items returned. I was forced to spend time reviewing the entire order, comparing it to the refund emails to check what wasn't refunded. I was about to contact them to find out why ¬£170 of products weren't refunded but luckily spotted the total in my bank statement matched. I'll never shop with ASOS again."

This company will rob you blind don't bother.Never use this site if you would like a nice experience.

This is probably on of the best retailers out there except for Amazon.I've made dozens of orders, going years back, and they never ever failed me. Everything is delivered on time, and even if there's a delay, it's a matter of days. Most cases- package reaches me within a few days. The quality is amazing - except for the 'asos' bran itself which is not that good, but hey, it's super cheap, so it's worth it.Talked to costumer service once, and they were very informative and nice, so no bad review there."

"October 01, 2018",1,"Terrible, unsympathetic, robotic customer service","Terrible, robotic customer service and refusal to refund for any reason. I was on a chat with someone thinking I was making progress, only for them to take FIVE MINUTES to type the SAME COMPUTER GENERATED RESPONSE I was getting over email from every single employee there. It's like they don't even read your responses - they just see the word ""refund"" and ""no proof of posting"" and then copy + paste their generic, unhelpful responses back to you.They just started requiring ""proof of posting"" - I have never, ever been asked for this before, until the last 2 months. Now, they REFUSE, NO MATTER WHAT to give a refund or store credit for any orders not received. In fact, store credit is not even an option. Apparently YOU are responsible for what the USPS does with your package until ASOS receives it. They WILL NOT give you the benefit of the doubt, EVER. You are just a number to them. You can email and chat with all the people wherever they are at, and they will all give you the same. exact. answer. They will not respond with emotion, or sympathy, or anything, EVER. I would say I am never going to order from them again, but that's a lie. They have cute clothes at prices I can afford as a lower income person in an expensive cost of living area. So, what my plan is going forward is to ALWAYS OBTAIN PROOF OF MAILING THE ITEM BACK. I will even pay for it if I have to. I don't care, as long as I can prove to these thieves that I returned my items. I am not a thief, I've never stolen from ASOS and pretended to return something when I didn't. Even though they prefer to consider all customers as thieves, I am still going to order from them. And how will I protect myself? I am going to do exactly what they asked, prove to them I returned my items, and FORCE them to refund me next time this happens. If they play games like this again when I DO have proof, then I may consider finding other places to shop.Buyer beware. Be sure to follow the instructions of obtaining proof you made a return!"

Went to get them our neighbour seems to have never received them, after went through the help chat services and raised a request for enquiry. I waited for an answer but nothing for a week. I had to call asos customer service and then they mention, it has been dropped in no 20 not 17? Checked with the neighbour again and they confirmed the same ‚Äònever got it‚Äô.At this point, I did not knew what to do and advised Asos to have it collected from the same place wherever the driver has left it. Hence, I thought everything would be resolved by now, but this morning recieved an email from ASOS, ‚ÄúMy name is Isobel, I'm one of the supervisors here working alongside Paul.  He's not in over the weekends, so this has been passed to myself.  Thanks for getting in touch, I hope you're well!I've just been in touch with DPD and they have advised me that they have a signature match for someone with that name at number 20 from a couple of previous deliveries.  As such, they have deemed this correctly delivered and we'll no longer be able to take this any further.  From this point on, this would be a civil matter between yourselves and your neighbours.  I appreciate this isn't the answer you were looking for, and for that I do apologise.If there's anything else I can do for you, let me know and I'd love to help.Best Wishes,IsobelASOS Customer Care‚ÄùI do not understand if the neighbours are claiming they have not recieved it then, how can ASOS ask their customer to enquire something without evidence. The signature they are claiming has not been shared with me yet. I just want my refund back as I never recieved the order I have placed them, is that too much too ask? If the driver delivers in the wrong place and cannot locate them, is that the customer problem. I feel like a Ping Pong ball chasing with neighbour 17, 20, DPD anf Asos with no results.

"September 29, 2018",1,AVOID,"Order was dispatched 25th September and was to be delivered on or before 27th September but no order received. Contacted on twitter for my younger brother as this is the first thing he has ever ordered and didn‚Äôt know what to do, was told due to GDPR he had to contact them. He contacted them on Facebook as on their website but had no reply. Today, he contacted through live chat and was told the same GDPR line that the account holder had to contact? He was logged into his ASOS account so how was he not the account holder? Then asked for his address and said he needs to wait until 9th October for his order and if not received by then, then we can contact again?? How is he expected to wait two weeks for a delivery that was meant to be delivered two days after dispatch? He asked for a refund as he hasn‚Äôt received the order and isn‚Äôt waiting two weeks but he was refused and told he has to wait until 9th October to go any further. If the order isn‚Äôt delivered on the 9th October either then will he have to wait another two weeks? Found the ‚Äúhelp‚Äù appalling, they clearly do not  want to help their customers and just want their money. I would avoid ordering from this company as they try to avoid even speaking with you and in the middle of a conversation the chat was ended by the operator!! No further forward and the money still taken but no order to show for it."
"September 29, 2018",5,Good personal experience,"I have placed about 10 orders on ASOS. Everything has been well so far. Got plenty of clothes from them and some new favourite personal brands. Delivery is fast, at 7 days. Customer service is very good, never had any issues with them, have had them do anything possible within their powers.Photos can be missleading especially when coming to lighting, products may seem couple colours more vibrant or colorful, than they actually are. Returns proccess is simple and all returns have been accepted, but it is a lenghty proccess, I myself take two weeks into account. When ordering next day delivery, take into account that it takes them about a day to dispatch an order.The products I have kept satisfy me and I still use them on a daily basis.Can't complain."
"September 29, 2018",5,I Had a Perfect Experience With Them!,"I Had a Perfect Experience With Them!This whole review might sound like it was typed by someone who works at ASOS, but I promise I don't. This review is written for the people like me who had bought from them and then went and read all the nasty reviews. I was scared I had wasted my money, and that the sweater I had ordered wouldn't arrive by the time I needed it. Thanks to all these negative reviews, I had been wrecked with fear. However, here's how things went down with me.I had ordered a sweater for a costume, and thought that it was perfect when looking at the pictures. I had researched some reviewers and heard great things about them. So, I went ahead and bought it. Then, afterwards, out of curiosity, I searched up some more reviews. As I have stated before, none of these reviews were accurate for my experience. What ended up happening was that the sweater had arrived a day earlier, which was perfect to show my friends and family that day. Not only that, but the color was even better than what some of the videos on the website had shown. The fabric was knitted and soft, and didn't feel itchy at all. It kept me warm over another t-shirt, but I did wear it without. It was worth my money, and shocked me with how great it was from all the fear I had.If anyone is scared from reading these reviews, or even are thinking about not buying from them, do not listen unless the circumstances of some negative reviews match your's exactly. I would definitely recommend this store and their products, and they shipped from the UK to me in the US and arrived a day EARLY! Perfect experience, good day everyone!"

Speaking to customer service on live chat about delayed shipment for more than a week although was promised express shipping, the chat was ended abruptly by customer service with some rude responses to my questions. Not sure how they manage to employ such people with such attitude. Really brings down the reputation of the company."
"September 28, 2018",1,Gross,Gross! They sent me a dress that was obviously worn. It must have dipped in perfume. The armpit area was white (on a black dress) - obviously deodorant residue. No inspection for return item what so ever. Will not purchase from them again.
"September 28, 2018",1,Worse customer service ever.,Ordered my items last month and still haven‚Äôt received my items till now. Halfway through i was given a replacement order and i haven‚Äôt received my items yet. Whats worse that they told gotta wait for another week. Customer service was useless
"September 27, 2018",1,The promotions are garbage when it‚Ä¶,"The promotions are garbage when it comes to returns. If you qualify for $100 off, but then make returns bringing you down to qualifying for $50-75 off, they will not honor a portion of the original discount and instead will take back the entire $100 off! As opposed to giving you the $50-75 off you qualified for. It‚Äôs a scam for sure as they expect you to read their lenghthy terms to know this. In addition, they do not print the cost of the item on the sales slip that comes with your order so you have to check the website and get out your calculator to try to make sure you don‚Äôt return items causing you to fall below the discount threshhold. After spending thousands on ASOS, I am moving onto shopping exclusively at higher end retailers that are far more accommodating/fair in their customer service/promotions.. I guess you get what you pay for with Asos."
"September 27, 2018",1,I would give them 0 stars if I could,"I would give them 0 stars if I could. I got a lovely email back saying that because I didn't receive 7 of the 8 items I had ordered, I would not be issued a refund and am no longer able to order from ASOS again. As if to say, they don't believe me and instead accused me of theft. SALTY, SALTY professionalism there. I had ordered from ASOS for years and had never had anything like this happen before.

"September 27, 2018",2,Oh me oh my!,"ASOS can have some the most unique clothes, accessories and shoes online. And the prices are pretty competitive for the quality. That‚Äôs why I gave them a 2 out of 5. However, this comes at a price. Since it‚Äôs fast fashion I can only imagine the ppl who pick your clothes and send it off to be shipped to be overwhelmed and flustered. The last two times I ordered from them I was sent the wrong item. I was lucky enough that my correct items were both back in stock and they made it up to me by paying for the shipping, duties and taxes, returned incorrect item and the amount I paid for my original item was refunded to me in full. So that was nice. But I literally had to demand to be sent all of my intellectual property and my account to be closed permanently. After reading online that the customer service on the chat and the ones who email you back are bots and not humans I felt this was the only way. On my second last order with ASOS I returned an incorrect sweater and added a pair of jeans that didn‚Äôt fit to the return shipment. I was refunded exactly 8 months later. They have a serious logistics issue. I feel as though a 2 star rating is more than fair and I will not be shopping with them ever again. It‚Äôs seems the more popularity they gain the more they find ways to cut costs. But with all that said once you do get through to a real human they are compassionate and understanding and they really do try to make it up to you to the best of their ability. Siobhan and Charlotte were great (especially because they were humans with real emotions). Now I skim through their website and find new sites to shop on but never ASOS."

In order to take this further, we recommend contacting your payment provider to dispute any lost funds. Your payment provider may be in touch with ASOS and we'll be able to provide information regarding your account to support their investigations. Once they're happy this is a genuine claim, they may refund your account.  In the event further orders are placed, they'll be cancelled.

"September 26, 2018",5,ASOS always good for me,Asos are a huge company and I have never had a problem with their delivery service and quality of goods. So I have never had to deal with customer service. What I can say is considering the size and volume they deal with the logistics must be astonishing. Also worth pointing out after reading some of the reviews here is that ASOS are not the couriers other companies are. ASOS like many other companies rely on these third party delivery services to get their goods delivered. After many years in business I can tell you that deliveries go wrong with all courier companies. In these cases we should blame the 'messenger' (The Carrier) and perhaps not the supplier.

When I explained that i‚Äôm paying for a service that i‚Äôm not receiving the advisor was quite rude and offered no help or gesture of goodwill to compensate for the inconvenience caused. I‚Äôm very disappointed in the service when I have been a very happy customer throughout the years and will now be taking my money elsewhere. Very poorly trained staff and a rude attitude to customers paying for services that are not being upheld.

"September 22, 2018",1,customer service is in the gutter,I love asos and their next day delivery service and the amount of clothes sold on the site but if i ever have an issue with my order or delivery their customer service is almost as if they have been trained by Mr Trump himself. Better training and peace offerings should be offered i think? The person i spoke to on their live chat was Burak who was absolutely useless and told me no more information than i already had.
"September 22, 2018",1,Extremely poor customer service,"Extremely poor customer service. No returns form or labels with order . This should be normal practice by now , like with most other stores. Trying to get a refund is proving to be a struggle as well. Never again."

"September 21, 2018",5,Reliable,"Some of the own brand products are lacking in quality but have been a customer for years now and never been let down.  Delivery is always on time and accurate and returns very easy.  Only had a couple of ""incidents"" but both resolved well: 1. Once I returned two items but only one was registered as returned.  After using the ASOS chat function, the second item was also refunded.  2. One item of clothing shrunk significantly after washing in accordance with instructions so I arranged a refund with ASOS easily."
"September 21, 2018",1,Bad customer service and delayed delivery!,"Honestly their customer service sucks. I have two orders that is way pass the delivery date and all they can tell me is to wait till another later date, and if by then, no parcel is received then get back to them. Like you are suppose to help me, not asking me to just keep waiting especially if i need the item for a birthday celebration! Now i need to spend more money to source from other sellers while this parcel is missing!Their standard reply would just be ""We have to follow our process when orders are late. If you haven't received order 353639147 by the end of day 21st September, please get back in touch with us tomorrow and then we'll be able to help.""Really really bad experience with their delivery!"

"September 20, 2018",2,"Company changed, gone from my first choice to something I'll avoid.","I can't believe how much this company has changed over the last year or so, maybe even 6 months. I've shopped with them for over 10 years, have been a VIP level customer, have paid for premier delivery etc.Their customer service is truly abysmal - I've had repeated issues this year with parcel delivery (completely pointless me paying for next day) and every time they've been as helpful as a chocolate hammer. When offering to replace a faulty item, they said it would take 3 days to deliver - I pointed out that I could order it myself and supposedly receive it the next day! The biggest disappointment has been their resetting of A list levels and points following GDPR. As someone who works in technical product management, and has also had to handle GDPR, I am telling you it was absolutely not necessary for them to delete your levels and points. I can't understand why they've made the decision to do that. They still have your order history, they can still see what level you qualify for based on your last year of purchasing history. It's an absolute sham. It resulting in me losing my level and points, and subsequently not getting a birthday discount code (a small thing, but actually a really negative experience for me as I was anticipating it and saving items to get for my birthday!)ASOS no longer puts the customer first or seems to care about level of care and making customers feel valued. Every complaint I've had has been met with a virtual shrug, no useful help, and the occasional sad 'please accept a 10% discount code' - which is another chocolate hammer, as I already get 10% off all purchases with my NUS."

"September 20, 2018",1,charged me twice and wont return my money,"During checkout their website glitched and reloaded resulting in me being charged twice for my order and despite sending screen shots of my bank showing the two debits a minute apart, the 2 paypal transactions with different IDs for the same items and correspondence from both my bank and paypal asos spent three days denying and arguing with me about the fact they charged me twice, would not take my concerns seriously and were honestly the worst company ive ever had to deal with. Now they have finally admitted that they were wrong and have ""cancelled the order"" however my bank is still holding my money until asos emails them to say that the money wont be taken... asos says ""Sorry we cant contact your bank"" You are a huge multi nation company and you don't have a single person who can send a basic email so i can get my money returned to me. This means my money wont be released back to me for up to a month and i have debits that will now default and cost me dishonor fees. There is no concern for customer satisfaction whatsoever and i wont ever buy from them again."

"September 19, 2018",2,Order regularly for Asos over the past‚Ä¶,"Order regularly for Asos over the past couple of years and I have never had an issue until recently. However this issue is absolutely rediculous. I ordered products due on the 1st of this month (not a small order), via next day delivery (premium membership). They didn't arive which was dissappointing.. However, the issue only arises when it comes to chasing whats happening in regards to a refund on products that appear to be lost and nobody knows where they are! As informed by their customer care team the will have recived the products on the 18th, as goods are automatically returned to them from where ever after not being collected 7 days. 10 days for the returns to be ""processed and refund to be issued"" (their words). It's the 19th today I still yet have to hear anything from the company but ""wait for our specialist team to look into this, we will email"" I'm fed up of lack of communication. Why am I waiting on a refund for products that have/are seemingly never going to be in my possession? Besides this experience; this company has been fine. Probably because I haven't had to communicate with the aftersales or customer care."

I receive a package at 13th of September, which was apparently not mine. I send it back to them, like I am supposed to do. BUT today is 18th and I still doesn't have my dress. I tried to contact them, but because I am living in Austria and they have hotline chat only for german customers, I wasn't received any information or help. I paid them, I want my money back but I am not a german customer. So funny now I don't have dress for my Wedding and money. Thanks Asos for the wonderful experience I will never visit you ever again.

Firstly, my order has been shipped on 11 Sept 2018, then system estimated I will receive my parcel on 1st October 2018. But guess what, I received my parcel after 1 week (18 Sept 2018). After saw so many negative review from other customer, I am happy because my parcel has safely arrived my place (Malaysia) and my clothes are fit to my shape. Really recommended and will purchase from them again in future."
"September 17, 2018",1,I sent back a Nike swimsuit from a‚Ä¶,I sent back a Nike swimsuit from a large order and Asos are saying they didn't receive it.  When I rang the garage I sent it back by they said this has never happened them before and that it was definitely sent back.  I even supplied Asos with the Garage details I sent it back by.  They refuse to refund me for the swimsuit.  I will never buy anything from Asos ever again and I will be advising anyone I know not to and will never allow my daughters to buy from them.
"September 17, 2018",4,You have won me back over!,"I have had terrible experiences with ASOS in the past so I shopped shopping with them for a few years, however my friends are always saying how great you are now, so I thought I would give you another go.I have since signed up for premier delivery again and you are fast becoming my fav! Only thing I would suggest is that your wish list shouldn't expire within 60 days, I would like things to show in there if still in stock."

"September 16, 2018",1,Is CEO a sixteen year old ?,"This is my second review. I had to work for my order two weekends in a row because ASOS customer ‚Äòcare‚Äô team wouldn‚Äôt. Had to pick up phone and call DPD who helped me track my delivery. Had to ask them if I could come and collect the parcel myself. Item was for the wedding and I really had no time to wait. Even though all my issues were related to bad driver behavior and DPD said they gonna investigate this, the impression I got when contacting ASOS customer service was that it‚Äôs my fault that I liked the item so I now need to accept my struggles if I want to get it ! The emails I received were extremely immature saying that their service is usually at a very high standards and this is just a one-off case. I had to send them this link showing other 5000 customer reviews and also the image of my Sunday‚Äôs pick up location showcasing what their ‚Äòfree‚Äô delivery actually means. The chat is completely useless, what they tell you is what you can read yourself on DPD tracking information so maybe if you have reading issues this might be helpful. Your delivery might also get further delayed  (you had the courage to contact them, how dare you?) ! When I figured out the number to call ASOS directly someone was laughing in the background. When asked to speak to a manager, you will get the answer that all of their staff members are trained equally. You might get a call back from supervisor, offering you a 15% discount on full priced items naively thinking you‚Äôd like to order from them again. Honestly, if I move out from London it would probably be ASOS fault.P.S. you can see I never left any negative comment on this platform before ASOS came to serve meThis is an update. ASOS contacted me and resolved the issue in a professional way."
"September 16, 2018",1,ASOS should be ashamed of their customer service,"Signed up to Asos a few weeks ago and made 4 orders 1. First order never made it. Someone at ASOS recalled the parcel before it got delivered 2 & 3 no problems with theses orders. 4. Arrives at my house ripped open so I check the parcel and 1 and a half items are missing. I contacted ASOS on the chat thing on the website and explained that a Tshirt and tracksuit bottoms of a tracksuit set aren‚Äôt in the parcel. They tell me they‚Äôll look into it and get back to me in a couple days.  The next day I recieve an email telling me I will have to pay for the whole parcel (¬£300) not just the items missing, they are closing my account, I shouldn‚Äôt make any further contact and should get hold of my bank to claim back the money. I went on the chat, Twitter, Facebook where no one would even reply to my messages they literally completely ignored me for 48hrs until I eventually found a number to contact them on where they basically told me I couldn‚Äôt send back any of the items and have to pay for clothes that I don‚Äôt like and don‚Äôt fit me. I can never shop with ASOS again all because THEY or DPD have misplaced 1 an a half items. I‚Äôve never been treated so poorly or been so angry with a company. I‚Äôve told all my friends and family who  will now be boycotting ASOS. If anyone from ASOS ever reads this you should be ashamed"
"September 15, 2018",1,Premier delivery and customer service a complete sham,"Shopped with them for years always been happy until the last 6months- a year. I pay for premier their ‚Äònext day delivery‚Äô subscription and haven‚Äôt received a number of them on time. Normally I‚Äôd let a couple slide which I did but my latest one I needed on time as it was a sports bra for an activity weekend away. I had to cancel this trip. The repose I got from ‚Äòcustomer service was appalling.  beth tours[07:58:24] this order and my last two have taken more than the next day that you promiseASOS[07:58:25] Hi, you're through to ASOS - thanks for letting me know your details. I'm just going to check this info for you.   Your chat reference is 15541528.[08:03:06] You're now chatting to Seanbeth [08:03:27] hello[08:04:05] can you help me, I pay for next day delivery for the year and I am not getting this service[08:05:17] the order I placed 2 days ago still hasn't been delivered when I needed it for last night and this weekend and you are now going to try and deliver it to a business that is closed until monday.ASOS[08:05:18] Hi Beth, thanks for getting in touch with us. I'm sorry that some of your orders have arrived latebeth [08:06:36] this has happened on a number of orders and I just thought that maybe it was a once off but its continuously happening now. I order with you for the next day.ASOS[08:07:06] I completely understand, premier is a one-off payment for the year of ¬£9.95, our next day delivery for one order is ¬£5.95. Just by using a premier more than twice will be beneficial for anyone, I still understand the frustration. These delays are out of our control as we're going through a busy period at the moment.beth [08:10:46] thats not acceptable though. I pay for the service that you promise next day for me. I dont mean to be difficult but if you cant provide the service then don't promise it its false advertisement. i let the first couple of orders go through as late and havent complained because i understand sometimes a business has issues but you are continuously getting my custom because rather than me shopping elsewhere because i belive i am getting a service from you and i am not.[08:11:57] you can buy anything from asos from other shops. I choose to shop with you because i have premier[08:13:12] and now I havent been able to follow through with my plans this weekend because you havent delivered what I have paid for which is next day on my itemsASOS[08:15:10] Beth, after 2 orders premier delivery is covered and pays for itself. Meaning all orders after the second are essentially free. Carrier delays and tech glitches are out of our controlbeth [08:17:40] i understand that and i really dont want to be difficult but you are being very condescending right now. If that is the case you should advertise premier as just 2 orders for 9.95 and not for the year on all your orders.ASOS[08:18:25] Your parcel is due to be delivered today please keep an eye on the tracking. Our premier terms and conditions do state that carrier delays and other delays are out of our control[08:19:43] Please use this link to our help page- http:/beth [08:19:49] Carrier delays and tech glitches although out of your control. you still are accountable to an extent for delivery of goods. As stated earlier that parcel which i believed to be delivered yesterday is going to my business where i will not be today and we shut over the weekend so that is no good to meASOS[08:22:01] You can use this tracking link to re-arrange or change the delivery http:beth [08:22:09] your customer service skills are appalling.ASOS[08:25:25] I'm sorry to hear that you feel this way. However I cannot change these delays. Here at ASOS we do all we can to ensure that orders arrive on time, however once orders leave us there is not much we can do. Espceially at this time of the year when carriers experience high amount of deliveriesbeth [08:27:57] I will be posting this script to facebook and instagram to let other people know that you are false advertising at this point and only care that 2 parcels get us next day to cover a 2 pound saving. you have been nothing but condescending and unapologetic about the whole situation. The company I work for is retail and i completlly understand carrier delays and shipment delays with all the holiday items being delivered across the world but at the end of the day if we were to deliver late to our customers we would be subject to charges and so put plans in place to avoid these situations. we are a small company and are putting these precautions in place so you as one of the largest retails have no excuse.ASOS[08:32:56] I'm sorry that you feel this way Beth. We refund delivery charges for all orders which are late and for faulty items. However as you have premier delivery we cannot refund this. We can only cancel it which means you lose your subscription. I've provided you with all the information I can however I cannot change the processes we follow. As I've said, premier delivery is not guaranteed, like other deliveries from anywhere there is always a chance there can be delays. We state this here in our terms and conditions- http:beth [08:35:19] Thats fine Sean. I will be voicing this on social media platforms like stated. Have a nice day.ASOS[08:35:55] If that‚Äôs everything for today, please close the chat when you're ready. Have a lovely day!beth[08:36:16] The chat has been ended"
"September 15, 2018",1,Order signed by someone else,"I made a large order last week. After not receiving it, I tracked my order and it said it was signed at 13:01. I do not know where it was delivered as no card was left notifying me... Asos took 2 weeks to investigate and then told me they were satisfied It had successfully been delivered to my home address by DPD therefore implying I am being dishonest. I provided evidence from work showing I was at work at the time the person signed for it. Asos is unwilling to speak or have some common sense. I don‚Äôt even want a refund, I just want to know where my order is so I can go pick it up!  I keep receiving generic emails from them, not caring at all and repeating the same thing over and over again. I was told to report the matter to my bank so I could get refunded. But why exactly should my bank pay when the error comes from the DPD Driver? Now I spent a lot of money on an order someone else has.. And on top of that I am being accused of being fraudulent. I have been an Asos customer for more than 10 years and, prior to this incident, used to order on a regular basis with no issues whatsover.  Do not think ill re-order after that! The customer service is appalling and the way I was treated was too.."
"September 15, 2018",1,Their customer service attitude is a mix of IDGAF & IDHAC,"If your parcel is late, don't expect any help.- First chat: they told me to wait till next day 10pm then contact them again.- Second chat: again, wait till next day (any time) and contact them again.- Third chat: wait 10 days and contact them again. I asked what will happen after 10 days. They outright refused to answer. They will ""advise me further"" after 10 days. I asked for the procedure for lost packages. No answer. They insist they'll ""advise me"" after 10 days.The worst company I've ever dealt with."
"September 15, 2018",1,SHOCKING CUSTOMER SERVICE!,"I ordered a shoulder bag. It arrived in a ripped plastic bag that had been re-sealed very unprofessionally and haphazardly with tape. I have ordered from Asos for years and I knew something was wrong. When I tried to take the bag out of the plastic bag the tape had stuck to it inside - thus it was a struggle to remove the bag. Upon inspecting the bag itself there was a long piece of thread, approx 20cm, hanging from the shoulder strap. There was also another shorter piece of thread about 5cm hanging from the other side of the shoulder strap. Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 I am entitled to a replacement, return and refund, discount or repair. I couldn't get a replacement as the bag was now out of stock, so on the same day of delivery I requested a discount but Asos continually refused. They insisted that I return it for a full refund. It just seemed that they wanted to be awkward, unhelpful and inconvenient because they can never sell the bag again at full price. I've ordered goods from countless other online companies and hey have been happy to give me a partial refund if I kept the item. In conclusion, I like their clothes but not their customer service which is bad and like others have said it is not good that there is no phone number for them."
"September 14, 2018",5,My favourite clothing website!,"I‚Äôve ordered from ASOS many times in the past two years and I must say that I have never been disappointed in their services. I‚Äôd never been a big fan of online shopping for clothing due to the hassle of things not fitting and having to return them, but ASOS have the easiest returns process ever (and it‚Äôs free!)I‚Äôm currently on my second lot of ¬£9.99/year next day delivery and it's great knowing I only have to order one day in advance so I can plan it around the times I‚Äôll be at home. I also love the fact there are so many brands on the website, meaning I don‚Äôt need to spend ages browsing through different websites and paying individual shipping prices for each one. Keep it up ASOS!"
"September 14, 2018",2,Next day delivery,"I order from asos all the time and usually it's fine but the next day delivery is abysmal. I ordered next day once before and it landed 4 days later. I never got a delivery charge refund at the time. Decided it may have been a once off problem and ordered next day delivery again this week for something this weekend. Received confirmation texts and emails to say it would be delivered by COB that following day. Today I get in touch via online chat only to be told that 1. Some items that i ordered and paid for aren't actually in stock, and 2. It will be with me Monday. So again, 4 days after ordering, not next day, after paying for next day and they won't acknowledge my request for a refund Disgraceful!"
"September 14, 2018",5,Fantastic service,"Fantastic service! I placed an order that was delivered to an incorrect address, I immediately went on to the web chat for help and a gentleman called Luke looked in to the problem.

I had an issue this week with one of my parcels being stolen from the delivery van, so I used facebook messenger to talk to customer service and they offered me a full refund along with a ¬£10 gift voucher, despite it not even being their fault. Overall, the staff were super helpful, the app is easy to navigate, and I love the product. They also have some great offers, like the premium delivery. Highly recommended."
"September 13, 2018",1,Should of listen to reviews.,Their APP isn't reliable. Doesn't send you email to confirm Orders. No tell you when there is a problem with your order on there app. Plus they have really bad service.
"September 13, 2018",2,"Parcel 3 days late and zero help from ASOS, appears to be no complaints procedure","I ordered a parcel to arrive on Monday. Due to various issues with UK Mail it still hadn‚Äôt been delivered until today (Thursday). I contacted ASOS by chat twice. The first time I was told they would email me back after contacting the delivery company which never happened, and the second time I was on chat to them for 45 minutes and nothing got resolved. The second time they were supposed to get back to me as well, but haven‚Äôt as yet. I was told the only way I could formally complain was to email them via their website. I tried to do this 3 times and it wouldn‚Äôt send. I also tweeted them and tried to contact them via Facebook messenger and again was completely ignored. During the 45 minute chat I also requested a call back and this never happened. I have now managed to get the parcel but purely through spending hours on the phone (and a total of 8 phone calls) directly to the delivery company and finally insisting they sent my parcel to me via a courier due to the amount of mistakes they had made. The issues with the delivery company were down to them, but they wouldn‚Äôt allow me to complain and said I had to do so through ASOS who were zero help. ASOS should have dealt with the company for me but did not do so. I don‚Äôt usually have issues like this with ASOS, but this whole experience was so stressful and frustrating, it has left me seriously doubting whether I will continue to use their services. I still haven‚Äôt raised a complaint with them because no one has gotten back to me with a way that I can do so which works."

You can only chat/email/social media contact with them in which this certain rep. named Ebrima was extremely unsympathetic to my situation. I sent her multiple screens shots confirming that my item was not going to be in time and she offered no remorse. This purchase was for my birthday weekend!!! I had 1 prior purchase last year with them which went great!! But I will never give them my business again!! The item was supposed to be here today and now they're saying not until Monday. I ordered on 9/5 and shipping was supposed to be on 9/6 come to find out that they didn't ship it until 9/10!!!!
"September 13, 2018",1,AVOID ASOS AT ALL COSTS,ASOS are absolutely shocking. After sending my order to a wrong address in a wrong country TWICE!!! They now tell me the delivery left the order behind the recycling bin and so I should check there. I live in the Netherlands so a little hard for me to check. Customer service staff keep copying and pasting the same message to me and are refusing to refund. I am honestly appalled by this out of this world terrible service. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THEM
"September 13, 2018",1,Asos are awful,Asos are awful. Months later I still cannot get the refund I am owed and am now resorting to small claims proceedings.
"September 13, 2018",1,"Shocking quality, non existing stock management system & customer service","Clothing quality is poor. Customer services pretty much unexisting. My trainers were delivered to the old address despite me changing to the new one. I was contacted by one of reps notifying me of that and promising to deliver item to the correct address (I was really impressed). However that didn't last long..  as I haven't heard from ASOS about rearranged delivery one week later, I have chased them up just to be told that they are out stock. I used ASOS for quite a few years now but it was certainly the last time. I better pay ¬£10 more but get decent customer service and good quality goods from your high street retailers."
"September 12, 2018",1,Customer service is ridiculous,"Customer service is ridiculous, cancel policy is ridiculous, they‚Äôre very unprofessional and disrespectful towards customers. I have been buying from this company for about two years and the one time I made a mistake and sent the package to my old address, they overlook my commitment to them and disregarded to assist me in changing the shipping address. This outfit was meant for an important event with my girlfriend but because I couldn‚Äôt get the package to my current address, I end up disappointing her. All ASOS fault!"
"September 12, 2018",5,I ordered multiple times on Asos and‚Ä¶,"I ordered multiple times on Asos and they only sent me a wrong item once, but I was able to send it back (free returns) and get a refund.Shipping is really fast (usually takes 3,4 days) and there are always good dealsTotally recommend and will be ordering from them again for sure"
"September 12, 2018",1,Rubbish,"Rubbish, weeks to reimburse refunds, next day deliveries not delivered on time, customer services try fob you off.."
"September 12, 2018",2,Incorrect Item never refunded,"I placed an order for the first time with ASOS. part of my order was sent with an incorrect item. I contacted the company multiple times, and returned the item as per company return and refund guidelines. They still did not refund for the incorrect item sent. I spent multiple e-mails stating the same info to multiple customer service reps and have gotten no results. This has been very discouraging and I'm less inclined to shop with them again."
"September 12, 2018",1,Poor experience,"Poor experience, never again. My parcel was set for click and collect, the store was collecting from was involved in fire, so courier could not drop there, it was returned to ASOS, they confirmed receipt of it, but then said it will take another 7-10 days to get parcel back to warehouse, then a further 7 to 10 days for refund to appear. Diabolical, customer services no help whatsoever. I have paypal disputed it to speed things up. Will never use ASOS again"
"September 11, 2018",1,They do not ship to Mexico,"I had a bad experience with Asos. I placed my order and paid with credit card. The order was supposed to arrive in 3 weeks (this time is more than enough for an item to arrive from UK to Mexico). It did not. I made I claim, and Asos told me that my order would take another 3 weeks. As you would imagine, the order did not arrive either. The only good thing is that Asos gave me my money back (after making a complaint, of course)."
"September 11, 2018",1,They don't send the correct item,"They don't send the correct item, or sizes then won't communicate with you i reasonable time. When asking to make a return a new item shows up. Now that i have to return as well however, this can not be done. Their smart robots on the chats are not of any help either. They simply will not help as ""they have technical issues"" i now have to deal with as well. What the hell is this. STAY AWAY from this cheap STUFF!! Pay the same price at your local store or at another website!!"
"September 11, 2018",1,If you paid with Paypal - please read!!,"I have been a customer with ASOS for over 8 years but my recent experience with them has completely put me off shopping with them again.I received my order on the 25th August and two items were missing. I spoke with 2 chat advisors who I hoped would be able to resolve the issue but unfortunately they could only reply with copy & pasted standard responses.I was advised that my issue would be referred to their 'specialist team' and I would receive a response in 12 days. I did not hear from them, so I decided to open a dispute on Paypal.A few days later, I received an email from ASOS explaining that I would need to re-order the missing items (which are now out of stock).I asked if they could send the message through Paypal directly, but they told me that due to GDPR, they could not respond to my Paypal dispute (which is complete nonsense!)I was then told that to receive a refund, I must close the Paypal dispute (which is very worrying, considering that the Paypal dispute system is there to protect customers from issues like this).I am really concerned that such a well known company as ASOS has such poorly training customer service advisors who apparently lack any understanding of Paypal and GDPR.It's now been 18 days since I received my order and I am still no closer to receiving a refund for the missing items. I am very disappointed in ASOS!"
"September 11, 2018",3,Never received items,"I ordered some products from The Ordinary, and was told I would receive my order by the 5th of September. The 10th I received an email that said, that they had received my return. Thing is, I never even received the package. I spoke to customer service, and they said that a mistake had been made, and that I had to order the products again. Most of the products are sold out now though. I'm quite disappointed"
"September 11, 2018",1,Unacceptable behavior!!,"Three customer care agents responded to me at least..but every time with the same generic half automated response after I send them all the details they need, multiple times! I have yet to receive my refund, and one agent after the other answers me back the same way, telling me to send my bank statement, again and again? Saying their special team will look into it. How long will they make me wait? It has been two months already and counting. How upsetting!I was a loyal customer of theirs, not anymore. I don‚Äôt trust them at all. Don‚Äôt order from them."
"September 11, 2018",4,Good service,"Good service, never had an issue."
"September 11, 2018",1,worst costumer service ever,"worst costumer service ever, and a bug on the website results in paying 10percent extra even after explaining that to costumerservice, I was pretty much ignored"
"September 10, 2018",2,Needs improvement,"Not satisfied, returned 2 vests that only cost ¬£7, they kept the ¬£3 delivery cost which is very cheeky - i know it costs money to ship items out, but its not as if asos are going broke (or are they?) and i`m sure they must get plenty of orders every week that keeps their online business running so they really should be refunding customers original delivery costs.Its okay when you buy something and are happy to keep it, but when you want to return something thats cheap and under ¬£25 it actually turns out not to be so cheap because they are keeping the money that customers spent on delivery costs, asos need to look at other online stores that are offering free delivery or atleast free pick ups and need to learn how to please customers because this is putting a lot of customers off, i shall not be buying from them again."
"September 10, 2018",5,Great all round service,unlimited next bday delivery and free returns. Such a good selection of items for everyone. Occasionally and ‚Äòstrangely‚Äô fitting item but overall one of the best online shops I‚Äôve used.
"September 10, 2018",1,The WORST customer service (or lack of customer service),"For such a 'Big' company the customer service is appalling. Used the live chat service and the representative I spoke to gave me a link on how to make a formal complaint to a manager. This link surprisingly didn't take me to a complaints page but took me to a fresh live chat with one of his peers. I explained to her that her colleague had clearly no clue and just fobbed me off. She obviously didn't bothered to read what i was saying and just said she couldn't help me with my original complaint. Getting more frustrated i asked for a manager to call me. She said they would call that night. I asked if they could call the next day which she said was fine and what time did i want them to call me. So the next day between 12-2 I awaited this manager call. The full day passed and the next day and the next. Then over 72 hours later a manager called. When I raised the fact he was to call me three days before he said yes it takes up to 48 hours for a call. On this response I said well you're 72 hours now before calling. To which he replied oh yeah we are busy. Explaining my situation to him he was as misinformed as the rest of the people I spoke to telling me one thing one minute and contradicting himself the next. He also confirmed that for bad customer service ASOS WILL NOT COMPENSATE the customer. WOW, what a great response from a company, even small online retailers have the customer at the forefront of the service. ASOS the customer is the one spending the money try at least to look after them a little bit and brush up on some entry level customer service. POOR POOR POOR. AVOID IF YOU CAN."
"September 10, 2018",1,Reject your shipment.,"I rejected the shipment!  Horrible customer service and shady business practices.  No clear information that customs and duties would be additional.  Made it appear items were coming from Canada.  No disclaimer during ordering or pop-up stating subject to customs or duties.  Customer service presented no options.  DHL Customs informed me that most companies just pay for the item or reduce the amount owing.  It was 1/3 the cost of my order.  It would appear Asos knows that if they don't alert the consumer, 80% will just pay the customs and not return the item.  Which equates to increased sales for Asos by not flagging the need for additional customs or duties."
"September 10, 2018",1,Shocking customer service team.,"Shocking customer service team.I ordered an item on the next day delivery service (I purchased the premier delivery), HOWEVER it's been 5 days and I still have not received this parcel. In fact the parcel has been delivered to a location 1 hour away from my address... I contacted ASOS regarding this and they confirmed that yes it has been delivered to the wrong address.. (no apology given). I was then told to wait 24 hours for someone to contact me. 24 hours later no one contacted me... so I contacted them AGAIN and yet I was told to wait another 48 hours... 48 hours later no one contacted me HMM. I contacted them AGAIN and I've now been told to wait 6 days so DPD can look in to it.The last lady I spoke to called FARA was rude, abrupt and ended the chat before I had even finished talking to her. Absolutely appalling service once again."
"September 10, 2018",1,VVIP benefits not given.,"I reached level vvip on their rewards system and was looking forward to the benefits. I ensured I was allowing all communication from asos by email, and I checked several times on the app to make sure I was allowing email communication and even checked my spam box frequently to ensure I wasn't missing out on any vvip events. Then on Instagram I saw there was a vvip event which I knew nothing about. I keep my apps up to date and the asos app had recently updated so I went on to check the communication settings once again. This time the layout was different and even though on the previous communications layout I had allowed all email communications, the emails for the rewards system was turned off. I spoke to asos customer services about this and all they said was sorry and offered nothing to make up for me missing out on the vvip benefits through no fault of my own but because of an issue with their app. I've had other issues with asos such as not receiving a refund, but this was the nail in the coffin. I spent a lot of my money to get to vvip level and was looking forward to the level benefits - but it turns out it's just a ploy for customers to spend money and asos will do anything to prevent it's customers from having the benefits it promised."
"September 10, 2018",1,Ordered an outfit well in advance for‚Ä¶,"Ordered an outfit well in advance for an event. Went to collect my order and it had got lost somewhere between being dispatched and getting to my click and collect store (despite having received an email to say it was ready for collection at the store). All of the 3 parties (ASOS, Hermes and store) taking no responsibility for what had happened and basically just told me I wouldn‚Äôt have my items for the event and that‚Äôd it take 6 days to look into it. No apology from ASOS. Won‚Äôt be using them again."
"September 10, 2018",3,Very Hit or Miss...,"Very Hit or Miss...ASOS is great when you're in luck and you just so happen to stumble upon a ""good"" release cycle because not every cycle (i call it a ""cycle"" because the change-over period of its sold items on the site is too quick for it to be a season) is consistent. They also try their best to resolve any technical problems, though I feel they could try harder as I've been locked out of my ASOS account for over a year now and am unable to access it at all despite calling technical support for help."
"September 09, 2018",1,Poor Customer service and poor courier service,Asos used to be brilliant until they started cost cutting on delivery. DPD when they use them are fantastic never been let down once. Unfortunately they are using Hermes more and more and the service is shocking. Every single time they use Hermes my parcel arrives late. I always use next day delivery and if they deliver via Hermes it turns up two days late. The response from asos is just as poor sending copied and pasted text stating delivery times with no explanation as to why parcels are late or an apology. I will be using a different shopping site going forward as you cannot rely on asos anymore.
"September 09, 2018",4,Items came really quick and before expected date,Order my items came really quick and returned two tops and refund processed quickly and efficiently. Great choice and selection.
"September 09, 2018",5,First time buyer,First time I've used ASOS but the delivery arrived within 2 days and the fit was perfect. I would definitely buy from it again.
"September 08, 2018",5,Love ASOS,"Wow, Im so surprised when I read all the bad reviews here about ASOS. I have been purchasing a lot from ASOS and all their products are well quality and look exactly like pictures. I have just returned 5 items at once and the process was very smooth. Within 10 days as they said, I got all my refund back, slowly but Its not a big deal for me at all. Their customer services are great. Im in the US and ASOS is always my first choice."
"September 08, 2018",1,I too paid the premium annual delivery‚Ä¶,I too paid the premium annual delivery service waste of time !!! I ordered 10.30pm on Thursday. Cut off is 11pm for next day delivery. I got an email Friday morning apologising that my delivery would not be today but instead would be Saturday. I left this as the things I ordered I don‚Äôt need until Saturday night although i was unhappy by the service. Saturday morning I received an email saying it had been dispatched. Then at 1pm I received a second email saying that as per MY request the order had been changed to Monday ??? I called DPD to ask why they said that the parcel had gotten there too late do go out to delivery today ?? I then called ASOS customer service who were unapologetic and quite rude. The guy after calling DPD himself leaving me on hold for 10minutes basically tried to blame me for doing the order to late for the next day delivery !!! I then pulled him up stating that even if that was the case the next day was Friday and it being delivered on Saturday shouldn‚Äôt have been a problem !! He just mumbled something at me that was pointlessI ordered a number of items worth over ¬£500 to them and do so on a very regular basis Today I was left without anything to wear for my birthday. Did they care ?? Not at all. I asked why they advertise Ned day delivery on orders up to 11pm if they can‚Äôt do it ? I asked them what they will do about my order coming today he said nothing it will be there Monday. I told him to get it returned to them as I no longer want any of the items and will use a more reliable store in future. Still no aplogy offer of refund on next day delivery or anything else that will make me consider using them again. I have been ordering from here for years barely shopped anywhere else and now I will not bother again. My advise to anyone is do not rely on these people for anything you will be let down
"September 07, 2018",1,worst customer service i‚Äôve ever had,worst customer service i‚Äôve ever had. pay ¬£10 for yearly next day delivery and it never comes next day or even within two days but they will not refund me. everyone is rude that i have spoken to. i always feel awful afterwards
"September 07, 2018",1,ASOS premier delivery scam.,I've paid ¬£9.99 for next day delivery and my last 3 orders have arrived late. Upon contacting ASos all they tell me is there is a back log in there warehouse. Then I asked for a refund for the next day delivery service I paid for and they told me they can't refund.this is fraud on there behalf so BEWARE in paying for ASOS premier delivery as its fraud and a big scam to obtain extra money.

"September 07, 2018",1,Horrible customer service,"Dreadful customer service - mindless customer service team who are not capable of or interested in resolving an issue. They would copy and paste replies, not really reading the email and no direct answer. They just keep saying sorry and not much. Avoid at all costs"
"September 07, 2018",5,All good.,Can‚Äôt say in all the times I‚Äôve used Asos I‚Äôve had a bad experience. I like the fact they give you plenty of options to return the item too. With actual return labels. Well impressed.
"September 06, 2018",2,ASOS don't look after their customers properly,"ASOS really aren't a customer focused business. This is the first time I've had to deal with this type of situation with them... My next day delivery order didn't give me an ETA email / text as usual, so I tracked my order with the courier #UKMail @dhlexpress to see it said status - delayed. I contacted #ASOS on live chat and they said as the day of the delivery hasn't passed yet they can't investigate, despite knowing the status.Day 2, I contact ASOS again and they said oh yeah there's an issue...someone on the ""specialist team"" will now look into this. I asked Aaron to just reissue my order so I get it tomorrow but no only a ""specialist team"" member can do this. Oh and I have to wait up to 6 days for this to be resolved. ‚è≥I frankly don't care about why it got delayed, I just want my order. I also pay for a Premium Service with ASOS yet get 1-2 star customer service. Not once did they apologise or offer a refund or simply say they'll re-order for me so I get it tomorrow. I have to now get caught up in their investigation üò¥"
"September 06, 2018",1,Horrible customer service and experience,"The website itself is fine and the products are generally good until you encounter an issue and have to deal with the customer service. I ordered a number of items for next day delivery and I even payed for the yearly next day subscription. The carrier was DPD and I received several texts and emails confirming the date and time of the pending delivery. The parcel was eventually delivered to, and signed for by, the wrong person, in the next town over. I know this because the DPD driver who made the delivery was in my neighbourhood only 20 mins after that and told me that the wrong delivery had been a mistake by the DPD's own computer system. Therefore I had to raise a 'signature dispute' with DPD, which I promptly did. DPD then referred me to ASOS to seek replacement of the order or a refund. ASOS customer services are, howeve,r abysmal. Yes, you get to chat online with someone right away. But they stonewall constantly, insisting on investigating the issue with DPD. This of course would have been fine had they actually been keeping up with the promise to update me on the status of said 'investigation', which was supposed to be over 48 hours and up to 5 working days in total. Well, three 'chats' with customer services advisors, a placating early email and over 10 days later, I am still without any updates, a refund OR the products I paid for. Needless to say, I've now cancelled the yearly subscription to the next day delivery service, as I won't be using this website again."
"September 06, 2018",5,I love ASOS,I love ASOS. Shopped online many times. Clothes don‚Äôt always suit me but I just return them through the free collect plus. Always received my refunds. Had no issues at all. They‚Äôre one of my favourite sites.
"September 06, 2018",1,Veeryy disappointed with the service,"Veeryy disappointed with the service. they hacked my account, my order has not arrived, and they took my money, 214 $ for a watch, cancelled the order, did not send back money and blocked my account! very poor website, not gonna shop there again! this is disgusting."
"September 06, 2018",1,Badly let down by service,"Badly let down by service. Placed order almost 3 weeks ago, never received, no refund or update in the last 7 days. Courier lost my delivery, contacted ASOS, who didn‚Äôt really care, told me I‚Äôd have to wait for my order to be back in stock for a refund but how‚Äôs this going to happen if the courier has lost it! I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs my responsibility because I‚Äôve never seen the order, it‚Äôs not a return! Customer service was very poor, didn‚Äôt care about the issue. I‚Äôm now out of pocket as I‚Äôve got no order, no refund and I‚Äôve had to buy replacements. The worst is, had I not chased them and Yodel (for 5 days with very little answer) I‚Äôd never have known about the issue. Still waiting on an update from customer service but it‚Äôs been 7 days and I‚Äôm not holding out much hope."
"September 06, 2018",1,Terrible customer service,"Been on a chat with LEESHA for an HOUR. After 2 messages she just GONE. No respond nothing. Terrible customer service. After 55 minutes on the chat, she just ENDED the chat without explanation. I tried to chat with 3 different people - no one sorted my issue."
"September 05, 2018",1,Dreadful customer service,Dreadful customer service - mindless customer service team who are not capable of or interested in resolving an issue. My query supposedly refered to a higher level team and it even went downhill from then on. Avoid at all costs
"September 05, 2018",4,Fast deliveries. Reliable & free shipping & returns,"Nothing beats free shipping and unlimited returns. Quality is not always great but clothes are cheap. Brands like Ted Baker & Karren Millen are also available at a slight better price than at the branded online stores. All in all, good value for money."
"September 05, 2018",4,Easy and Reliable!,"Really good selection of own brand and designer clothing, whilst also being inclusive of different sizes. Standard delivery is always on the time and so is next day delivery. However, there should be free next day delivery if you spend more than a ¬£100. Also Gifting section could include more gift sets and normal gifts instead of being quirky/novelty orientated. The website is easy to use but the older style was a lot better and functional."
"September 05, 2018",1,Clothes are good but customer service‚Ä¶,Clothes are good but customer service team is terrible. Meant to have next day delivery as needed the items but they didn't come the next day. Spoke to customer services online (impossible to talk to anyone on the phone) and just got typical generic responses. Refused to refund next day delivery or offer anything to improve my experience. Very disappointing as order from ASOS a lot.
"September 05, 2018",1,Ordered a gift for someone,"Ordered a gift for someone, paid next day delivery and didn‚Äôt receive a confirmation of dispatch. Next day comes and I contact them, first person says that she can see my order is on it‚Äôs way to me, and an email was sent out so should be in my junk mail, which it clearly wasn‚Äôt, I go away tomorrow and now they have told me there was an issue with the warehouse so my order missed the cut off point for next day delivery!! Even though I ordered at 9pm, cut off time is 11pm. So I asked if they could change the delivery address, and they said no. Appalling and unacceptable, will NOT be shopping here ever again."
"September 04, 2018",1,Paid for a year of next day delivery‚Ä¶,Paid for a year of next day delivery and their outsourced call centre does not give a damn or offer any compensation when they fail to deliver on timeSo switching orders to a retailer who does deliver on time and who does care !
"September 04, 2018",1,I had a bad experience,"I had a bad experience, rude customer service, and they would copy and past replies, no direct answer, they keep saying sorry and not much. I have been waiting for my orders more than a month, I should have received them before my vacation started so I could use them, but guess what I had to buy the substitutes which I could wear, what made me spent another amount of money that I saved for the trip , I emailed them they told me to wait for 20 days, the 20 days has finished they told me to wait again for another 20 days, if theres any update they will be intouch. I refused to recieve any itme from their side and ask for refund, but there is no reply. I have been waiting for more than a day. I will never ever shop on that website."
"September 04, 2018",1,Like similar incidents I've read on‚Ä¶,"Like similar incidents I've read on this site about this company, I have had a not so good experience with customer service. I went on a honeymoon and received the wrong dress (after coordinating outfits with my husband). I bought shoes and jewelry to match the dress so in turn, I was extremely disappointed. I chatted with someone to check on the status of my return to find out it was being processed. I then asked if a coupon was possible and they said not and suggested I close the chat window if that was all I needed. Classic. I wish I could post screen shot. Jae was her ASOS chat name. Thank you."
"September 04, 2018",1,They've lost a customer in me,Im too mad to even go into a long personal account of my few experiences with their customer service. But their online chat consists of saying sorry and not much else. I have deleted my ASOS app and will NEVER shop with them again. I advise others who are expecting any level of customer service to do the same. Its time these huge faceless companies realise they can't treat the people that made them who they are like nothing!!!
"September 04, 2018",1,Completely disgraceful company,"I'm writing this to try and help other people not be treated in the same way. I'm still in the process of trying to get my money back from them. Everytime I've contacted their customer service team, they've been completely unhelpful, to the point where it feels like they're actually doing everything they can to block me from resolving the situation and get my money back. I returned some items, not everything was processed, and they kept asking for proof of postage/returns to help me. ""You've received the packages, you've sent me emails to tell me this, I can send you your own emails as proof"". They would end the live chat sessions, not respond to my questions, and robotically answer that without that proof they couldn't help. Finally I found it in my spam folder and their tune changed completely. Still not helpful, but at least there's a light at the end of the tunnel. To anyone using ASOS, if you're using their free returns service, you have to keep a proof of return as their hard company line is, the goods are your responsibility until ASOS receive them. Their whole attitude to customer service is laughable, disgraceful, woeful, and when you try and complain, there's no help for you."
"September 04, 2018",1,TERRIBLE Customer Service,"TERRIBLE Customer Service. ASOS failed to refund me for a returned item, after multiple conversations with their Customer Service department, I have now waited 5 weeks for the refund. This should have gone into my account within the last 5 days, I have now been informed it failed due to a 'technical' error and I will have to wait up to 18 days for an update."

Then in the span of 2 month Ive had 3 big orders very late on supposed next day delivery, terrible customer service chasing these up, and now being given the run around when trying to delete my account. What could a 'specialist team' possibly have to look into to delete my account on a clothing website??? Terrible company, along with DPD. Will never spend another ¬£ with them, coming from someone who has spent around 2k in last 2 years :("
"September 03, 2018",1,Worst customer service I have ever experienced,"I honestly don‚Äôt have the time to fully explain how poor the customer service is. A few examples include - no one takes ownership of an issue - customers keep receiving the same generic responses from different advisors- no one actually tries to help! I ended up finding out my package had never been sent to DPD whilst ASOS told me I had to wait til 10pm before they would investigate (DPD were very helpful)- they never contact you when they say they will- I phoned them a number of times and unfortunately got charged, until I managed to find a local number I could call (this doesn‚Äôt seem to be given on their app)- They do not value loyal customers- Their customer service representatives on twitter are often rudeThere is much more but I would be here all day. If you order from them, just pray you never have an issue..!"
"September 03, 2018",1,I never received my order and bad customer service,"I placed an order, and I waited 4 days, after the expected delivery date (7 days in total) I contacted the ASOS team, and they told me that the order never left to wearhouse and that it would take another 20 days for a specialist team to look into this. They already took my money and won‚Äôt give it back till the specialist team is done. I told them that I wanted to cancel my order, but they told me they couldn‚Äôt?. The customer service was so bad and they didn‚Äôt even apologize. VERY BAD SERVICE!"
"September 03, 2018",2,Terrible customer service - Item not arrived!!,"Been a customer of ASOS since the month it started as As  Seen On Screen. This week has been the second time I have had a problem with a delivery. The first time was many moons ago and was resolved really quickly and I was impressed that they just reordered the item for me and it was with me the following day. However, things have changed and this week having been forced to select free standard delivery on an order, despite having premier delivery on my account as the site would not offer it for this particular item, an item ordered on 27/08 and delivery due on or before 31/8 has failed to show up. Today is 3/9. I think it is unacceptable that I have to wait up 20 days for them to investigate why my item has not arrived. I need the item for a wedding this Friday!! I have found there chat system to be just a series of automated replies with no offer of assistance or an alternative. Tried asking for a refund as the wait was not acceptable and received a standard reply about only having an hour from placing an order to being able to cancel it. Again unacceptable as they have failed to honour the the contract of purchase. Terrible customer service.  Dispute now lodged with my bank for my money back.Request a refund at your own risk!!"
"September 03, 2018",1,Horrible customer service.,"Horrible customer service.Received my order just fine, but had to send it back because of poor fit. Returned package with all tags, order details, etc. Fast forward 2 weeks, no sign of refund. I emailed them at least 3 times, but no reply and so I never received my refund."
"September 03, 2018",1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!,"Reading through all these negative comments and I 100% agree and have received the same treatment.Back in May 2018, three of my parcels went missing as ASOS choose to use Hermes who is beyond rubbish at delivering on time - I should mention I pay ¬£9.99 for the year so I can receive next day delivery. After numerous chats, twitter exchanges and emails - 3 weeks had passed before they deemed my parcels lost and refunded me! 3 WEEKS!!! To me thats unacceptable - all the ""help"" I got from their customer service was generic and not personal to me, its like they spewed up a written script.  Main reason I was given was that apparently my address they couldn't find, however Royal Mail, DPD & Amazon have all managed to found my place and delivered on time but Hermes and ASOS won't able to locate my home.I have now closed my account with them and have been shopping elsewhere, since then they have sent me an email asking me to come back to them as I am a ""loyal"" customer but then they proceeded that email by still providing me with bad customer service!! its actually laughable how they treat their customers. Says alot when 50% of the reviews that have received are 1 star."
"September 03, 2018",1,Horrible customer service,"Horrible customer service, contacted them about a missing item in my parcel (a tracksuit jacket from a traxksuit set) was told straight away that it has been passed to a specialist team with a 17 day wait and from there all answers seemed to be automated/ scripted before being told to close the live chat window.  Feels almost like a scam because by the time the specialist team reviews my order it will have passed outside the return window. Never shopping here again."
"September 02, 2018",1,They don't care a f about customers,"I paid the 9.95 for 1 year of next day guaranteed delivery - once again ASOS have used Hermes and my order due yesterday still has NOT turned up today, I even had to call the couriour company myself (hermes) and i was told 12-3 arrival, now they are saying 6-8 pm. When I spoke to ASOS today they could not care, the attitdue was well its not really Guaranteed - errr like try reading how you advertise it. This company are a pile of poo when it come to putting customers 1st, all they care about is profit and the customer can just keep paying our massive profits and the bosses wages."
"September 02, 2018",1,Fraud??,"Fraud??I suspect Asos are selling stock they do not have and benefiting from holding customers money.Lets look at it from a physical shop perspective. You walk into a shop, the cashier checks they have the size you need. Confirmed your sized items are in the store room you pay at the counter and the cashier goes to get your items. A long time passes so you ask floor staff where the cashier/your items are. The floor staff have no idea. As you continue to stand in the shop waiting, you spot another cashier.. Maybe they can help?! This cashier engages with you but states he does not know where the original cashier or your items but gives you a phone number (tracking number) which does not work. So you go back to this cashier to explain the number doesn't work and this time he acknowledges you have paid for the items but informs you Asos will be holding on to your money for now. However he assures you you can go home happy (without your items or your money!) because the customer service team will 'be in touch' in 18 DAYS.  Does this seem normal to you? When Asos FINALLY get in touch they do not know what happened to that cashier or your items and low and behold they are now out of stock of the items you originally paid for?! Whether it's clear cut fraud or not, Asos are breaking their obligation to uphold the Consumer Agreement Act by failing to deliver products purchased within the agreed delivery date. I urge anyone who is experiencing these issues with Asos to seriously consider opening a dispute. I also urge anyone considering buying from this company to read all the reviews you can find (there are numerous reviews similar to mine).There needs to be an investigation into Asos conduct. Watch this space! Asos seem to have a positive reputation in the past so perhaps they have changed management? Perhaps they are now on the brink of bankruptcy and have to go to the measures of selling stock they do not have to stay afloat? Perhaps it is just fraud and they are relying on those customers who do not open disputes? Perhaps they are actually just seriously incompetent (this one seems the most far fetched!). Maybe Asos should advertise for short term investment for zero return - this is what they are doing only consumers are conned into doing so!?BE VERY AWARE!"
"September 01, 2018",1,WASTE OF MONEY! Would give 0 star if I could.,"Awful service. Spent a lot of money on a large parcel on 20th August, they said it was delivered on the 23rd. Yodel are honestly horrid, claimed they delivered it to my front porch when the front porch was locked and no card/vans to be seen. ASOS customer service have fobbed me off over 5 times, every time saying some nonsense 'specialist' team are investigating it and I have to wait 18 days. They always give copy and paste responses to try and placate me. An absolute pisstake, I will never shop with ASOS again."
"September 01, 2018",1,Did not deliver my order because they‚Ä¶,"Did not deliver my order because they ‚Äúhad a problem with getting the order out of their warehouse‚Äù. So I just got an email out of nowhere that said ‚Äúconfirmation of returned goods‚Äù. When I contacted them they said that the money would be transfered back to my account in the next two weeks. Since I really needed the things I ordered I was pushed to paying twice for my order and turns out most of the item I previously ordered were either sold out or not on sale anymore; when I contacted asos about this they said there was nothing they could do. I still decided to order, the second order was then not delivered until 9 days later, 4 days after the date they said that it should be delivered. Not happy at all about this."
"September 01, 2018",1,What a nightmare dealing with this‚Ä¶,"What a nightmare dealing with this company. Bought an item 10 days ago and it was supposed to arrive on the 29th. Emailed customer service and never got a response. Messaged them on FB and was told to now wait 9 more days! Ugh! Now I have to contact my bank, dispute, and get a new card ordered. What a joke."
"September 01, 2018",5,Restored My Faith In Online Shopping,"I'm usually a little wary of ordering clothing online- I'm a chubby gal and have been burned before with clothing running much smaller than the size I ordered, but ah. C'est la vie!  ASOS swooped into my life randomly after I commented on a customers cute shirt & they pointed me in their direction. I tentatively decided to check it out, and since their prices were reasonable I decided to order a couple things just to try them out. Not only did everything fit me comfortably & correctly, but my order got here in 3 days, and I didn't even pay for any kind of expedited shipping!? I was shook. I still am. My boots are wonderfully made, my denim jacket isn't too rigid {it's actually more of a relaxed denim and I love it}, and THE TIGHTS, which I tend to have issues with bc my thighs & midsection don't like to agree on where they should rest, ARE PERFECT. They don't roll down, they don't dig in. 10/10 my favourite tights. I've only had my stuff for 4 days or so, but I tell ya- I'm happier than a vampire in a low-security blood bank! I'll definitely be coming back for more stuff."
"September 01, 2018",1,Disgusting service recieved from asos,"Disgusting service recieved from asos. Returned items and was not refunded for them had to chase up and wait weeks for a refund.

"September 01, 2018",1,Customer Apathy Is More Like It,"It feels as though ASOS is trying to avoid buyer fraud by treating their loyal customers like criminals. They ""never received my return"" (which I mailed over a month ago) and that is ""my responsibility"" even though I did everything I was instructed to in order to make the return. They insist I need proof of postage, although they don't provide a tracking slip like most retailers do. They refer to the fine print that buyers would have to dig through legalese to find, then end the chat before the issue is resolved for the customer. They are resting on their laurels and don't care if they upset a buyer. Furthermore, I suspect that there are robots rather than humans on their customer help chat."
"September 01, 2018",5,Thank you,üïä I really like the garment and material thank you
"August 31, 2018",1,Why do I keep ordering from ASOS,"Why do I keep ordering from ASOS? I always think ‚Äúit‚Äôll be okay this time‚Äù - wrong again! My order didn‚Äôt turn up on time and now that I‚Äôve returned the items, they‚Äôve missed one of the items from the refund and it is going to take 18 days and a specialist team to find it apparently! Brilliant."
"August 31, 2018",1,The worst of the worst,"The worst of the worst  , the customer service is so rude  They are just good at wasting other people Time"
"August 31, 2018",1,Don‚Äôt order in advance as you still won‚Äôt receive it in time!,Ordered an item 9 days in advance for a wedding. I don‚Äôt have the Asos next day delivery as I don‚Äôt use the site that often but every time I have used it previously it has been reasonably good for delivery and quality. So anyway I ordered a dress 9 days in advance of when I need it for thinking it would be here on time. It is due today and earlier in the week I started worrying about where my item is so I contacted ASOS a total of 3 times to ask. Each person on the online chat service assured me it would be here on time (Friday 31st). So I check daily and the item says dispatched- brilliant! However when I go into track the item the courier hasn‚Äôt actually received my item.So I told Asos this but no they assured me there was a delay in Update with tracking details.So it‚Äôs Friday 31st. I still haven‚Äôt received my item. I contacted them tonight and they told me to wait until 10pm. Well it‚Äôs 10 and still no item. I knew 100% earlier in the week from the lack of communication from them and the courier that it wouldn‚Äôt be here in time for the wedding - at which I‚Äôm doing a reading. Being the trusting person I am shouldn‚Äôt have believed the lies of ‚Äúit will be here by Friday‚Äù. Now I have nothing to wear tomorrow to match my remaining outfit and was foolish enough to believe them instead of trusting my instincts! It seems to me unless you pay for their delivery next day service even if you do order in advance for your items they‚Äôre not interested! 9 days it should have 100% been here as standard delivery can take between 4-5 working days! Frustrated.Update: They lost my order. Won‚Äôt refund me for 15-18 days as they have to investigate.
"August 31, 2018",1,Will never shop on ASOS again,"Don't know what's going on with ASOS now but will never shop with them again. Paid for annual next day delivery and have been told will not receive package until next week. Customer service are rude and unhelpful and ended the conversation without the issue being resolved. I've been shopping on ASOS for years and have always been happy with the service but maybe it's new management or new shipping contracts that have created problems. Anyway, won't be shopping there again."
"August 31, 2018",1,FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO SHOP,Been an asos customer for about 8 years ordering THOUSANDS of dollars worth of clothing every month. They sent me an order where multiple items were missing I complained and they blocked my account telling me never to order from them again EVEN THOUGH there was proof and admission from the United States Postal service who admitted IN WRITING that my package was delivered damaged with multiple items missing.
"August 31, 2018",5,Best online shop by far,Been using ASOS for more than 4 years and not a single time I've had an issue.  Their custimer service responds quickly and professionally!  Will be continuing to use them!
"August 31, 2018",1,"DOES STANDARD SHIPPING NOT INCLUDE ""DELIVERY""???","I have an order I'm still waiting on even though ASOS said I'd have it delivered 3 days ago. When I chatted to their representatives they said they couldn't help and had no idea where my order was??? And that if I don't have it by September 12th, they would ""look into it""? Is this a joke? Am I being punished for not paying the extra 15 euros for express shipping? Have I spent my money for my parcel to go missing? In case you aren't aware, I could have also grabbed that money and threw it in the fireplace, I wouldn't have my dress but at least it would provide some light entertainment. If you can't guarantee that I will EVENTUALLY receive my parcel, then you should just force people to pay the extra 15 euro for shipping. Or at least let us know that you strap parcels on donkey's bags and give them a kick in the back and hope for the best."
"August 31, 2018",1,Terrible customer service Asos,"I have ordered with Asos for several years and never had any complaints- though until now have had no reason to contact customer service. I paid for items on Tuesday 28th August and paid for express delivery (gift fit husbands birthday) to arrive on or before August 31st. By 3pm,order had not arrived so contacted customer service. On round one,was asked to log on via e mail and re contact via this method/ live chat. On doing so, my account was 'locked' by asos,told to contact customer care again. On second attempt via live chat,told to log on via my account- I had to explain this was not possible as asos had locked my account. Advised that my query would need to be passed to another person etc etc who would contact me by e mail! Two hours later,asos had not bothered to make contact via e mail and my order had not arrived. I contacted Customer service yet again (third attempt) pleading for help- all I wanted to do was find where my order was given I had paid in full for my goods and paid for express delivery. Told to wait for an e mail and my request could not be processed whilst my account was still locked. Two hours later and my order has not been delivered nor have asos had the courtesy to resolve my account issue,or made any effort to help me locate my order. Appauling customer service Asos- we are paying customers and fobbing people off and wasting our time is completely unacceptable. Perhaps highlighting these issues via social media might be the most appropriate option for dissatisfied customers going forward."
"August 31, 2018",1,Unhelpful and rude customer service. Awful product,"After buying my usual size shoe in a 7, the product that arrived was at least one size too big although marked as a 7. Stupidly on my part, I threw away the packaging thinking buying some insoles would help. They didn‚Äôt, so I contacted ASOS to ask if they would accept the return without the box. I was told they could not confirm whether or not the warehouse would accept and refund if not sent with the box. To be sure I was correct in thinking there was basically nothing they could to do help I asked ‚Äúso there‚Äôs nothing you can do to resolve my issue‚Äù the agent replied ‚Äúno, next time I suggest you refer to the size chart to avoid mistakes such as this‚Äù obviously the size chart recommended a 7. Not only did they sell me an overpriced, poor quality product, they couldn‚Äôt even have the decency to help me return it. Nor could they even have basic respect for their customer."
"August 31, 2018",4,Great 'Tall' Range,"I love this website, it has a great range of choice and a large 'Tall' range which you just don't find in many places. I do miss the original As Seen On Screen where you could find similar outfits as seen in the press but overall this is a fab site!"
"August 31, 2018",1,Shop elsewhere. Anywhere but here.,"Really poor service. Late delivery and didn't even send the items that I ordered, they sent substitutes! Their next day subscription is a scam - they can send your order by UK mail which has no chance of reaching you the next day. Customer service reps can be very unhelpful - one even implied that I was lying about not receiving a delivery because the courier's GPS tracker was logged at my address. This means they consider a delivery to be attempted if a van pulls up in your street, not by an attempt to ring your doorbell or knock at your door. Cannot believe how many ways they managed to mess up my order. I anticipate a new battle to get my refund. Their partnership with Hermes is a recipe for disaster."
"August 31, 2018",1,Very poor customer service,"Very poor customer service. I seriously doubt my order was ever sent out. Tracking code doesn't even work and the postal service couldn't find any detail from my code either. I don't fault the postal service, ASOS is screwing up big time. I used to like this company A LOT! But this was the last time I ever want to deal with them after two fails on their part. I will never order there again."
"August 31, 2018",1,"If I could give them 0 stars, I would.","My experience has been horrible and has gone so far as to cause me anxiety and stress over the whole situation. I ordered a bikini on the 14th of August on the Australian website. When I receive the item after a little while, they seem to have sent me the wrong size. Whether or not that comes from a faulty conversion between the Australian and UK website or from a mistake when sending the item, I don't know, but the fix is fairly simple: For them to send me the item I originally ordered, and for me to return the other item. However, it did not turn out to be that simple.I contacted ASOS via chat straight away, and was told they would send my issue to a ""specialist team"". When asked how long it could take, they told me that due to high workloads it could take up to 10 days. I also contacted ASOS via Facebook, and after being asked for my order number and email, they stopped replying. On the 29th I got a response telling me I'd been sent a replacement, but in the message, they told me the size was the same as the one I originally got (which was, of course, the incorrect size), so I asked them straight away if the size they were to send would be the right size or not, and the person copied and pasted the original message. No answers were given. I even provided pictures and a simple explanation in case they misunderstood, but still received no answer on Facebook or chat.I then went on to call customer service via the phone. This included me having to pay for credits to call a UK phone number, but at this point, I had tried every single option. I call and am quite quickly put in touch with a very helpful lady on the other end. She tells me they can't know for sure what size I've been sent as a replacement until it arrives, and she's very apologetic and generally a nice lady (only positive reply so far). So I am told to wait until it arrives, and so I do.The parcel arrives, and they've sent me the same WRONG size once again. I contact customer service via chat as the phone is not open yet, and am told to keep waiting. The person doesn't even answer any of my questions, and basically tells me to wait for an email, but what I'm waiting for and for how long I have no idea. He then proceeds to just end the chat abruptly."
"August 31, 2018",1,horrible customer service,"horrible customer service!  my order was placed on 8/23 and for 2 day shpping. it never came and no update for the tracking still when I'm typing this. contact customer service, Donika's reply is she can't do nothing until 9/5. and disconnect the chat without the solution. won't never come back for sure."
"August 31, 2018",1,"Lack of customer service, slow delivery.","Express delivery hasn't updated on tracking for 6 days, customer service say ""wait till the 12th September"" - Estimated delivery date was Aug 31. So they just want me to wait around. Nicola ended the live chat abruptly, after just saying ""keep waiting"". Terrible customer service, terrible tracking updates, the local carrier link doesn't even go to a tracking page. If I could give 0/10 i would."
"August 30, 2018",1,F*** ASOS,I normally would rate ASOS 5 stars because I love them and their clothes but this time around I‚Äôm extremely disappointed. I ordered 5 items totaling over $200. I ofcourse did two day shipping. When my package arrived it was open and only had one it. I immediately informed ASOS care team and got no response. I‚Äôve sent a minimum of 5 emails as well as contacted them on messenger and on instagram. I have gotten no response at all. They don‚Äôt care that my items were stolen before I received my package and they don‚Äôt seem to have any concern to attempt to handle my situation or even contact me back to acknowledged what was going on. Thank God for my bank being great and reversing the transaction but overall ASOS you lost a loyal customer. Shame on you all
"August 30, 2018",1,Waited over a month for a refund- still nothing,Ordered 3 dresses from ASOS. Only 1 arrived but they charged me for all 3. I had to wait 12 days while this was ‚Äúinvestigated‚Äù and I‚Äôve just had an email to say that I now have to wait another 18 days whilst a ‚Äúspecialist team‚Äù looks into this. Meanwhile they have over ¬£100 of my money and I have nothing to wear. Service has seriously declined over the past year. Won‚Äôt be renewing my annual delivery subscription.

Was told the same lie every day for over a week. Was fobbed off with stock answers on their online chat and told there was nothing they could do. AVOID at all cost. Used to be reliable, now have no interest in customers, just your cash.Bonus: the ""customer service"" team are rude, sarcastic and disconnect you when they run out of stock answers to dismiss you with."
"August 29, 2018",1,Poor service,"Normally I would rate ASOS 5 stars, I‚Äôve always found their clothes as described and delivery is quick. However, I am extremely disappointed and frustrated with this order. My order was placed on August 4th due to be delivered August 16th (lengthy delivery but I live in New Zealand so I understand). My order did not arrive and I received an email informing me there had been an issue with the courier and to allow another one-two days. The parcel did not get delivered so I spoke to he customer care team, they asked me to wait until the 28th, it still didn‚Äôt arrive, after speaking to another member of the customer care team they are now asking me to allow another 15 days!!! Up until now the customer care team have been informing me my order is on track which is clearly a lie. Waste of my time."

I was told by the courier Hermes that the item was lost but Asos still did not trust that and said I had to wait until the 25th, then they said 26th, then 28th. 28th came and they have now said. 'yeah you have to wait another 17 days so our 'team' can look into it. I expected at the least an offer of a refund or re-delivery but no. They make the customer pay for company mistakes by making them wait longer! So I will find out after a MONTH of waiting. Absolute joke of a company, do not order from them under ANY circumstances. Find another company that does the same thing better, It will not be hard."
"August 29, 2018",5,Great experience,"I only have had positive experiences with ASOS. I purchased premier membership which includes next day delivery for the year and everything I‚Äôve ordered arrives next day. The quality of the clothes are excellent and the do last, prices are great too. I‚Äôve bought some designer items for less than half price in sales so I love shopping with them."
"August 29, 2018",5,Excellent especially delivery time,"I had an excellent experience with ASOS, I was able to find the best bag which is brilliant quality at a reasonable price. In addition it arrived 2 days early, which is always a bonus."
"August 29, 2018",1,Horrible 'customer service',"Order placed for next day delivery. Order doesn‚Äôt arrive. Contact company live help to ask where the parcel is.Told that a ‚Äúspecialist team‚Äù will look into it and they will contact me within 15 days ‚Äì surely, customer service could use the miraculous invention of a telephone to contact their courier to inquire, but apparently it takes a fortnight for them to find the intelligence to do this.Ask for details of a manager as this ‚Äòservice‚Äô is not good enough. Refused.Ask for a contact email address to raise complaint of lack of ‚Äòcustomer service‚Äô ‚Äì advised to use webform on website ‚Äì apparently they don‚Äôt have an email address to raise complaints directly. ‚ÄòCustomer service‚Äô rep on live help then robotically reiterates it takes fifteen days as they are very busy ‚Äì I state this is not good enough, then patronising ‚Äòcustomer service‚Äô rep advises to close the live chat window and ‚Äòto have a lovely day‚Äô. Patronising, ignorant and arrogant moron."
"August 28, 2018",5,Can‚Äôt fault it,"Can‚Äôt fault it. Free return are great, premier delivery is great. DPD delivery in my area is really good.Clothes are usually good quality and student discount is a nice perk. Love the ¬£5 vouchers you get for being a frequent shopper too üíï"
"August 28, 2018",1,NEVER USING ASOS AGAIN,"I have been using ASOS for several years but will stop immediately after this occasion.My delivery (350768509) was not delivered after it said it had been. I chased their online 'help' team 5 times to discuss the matter. On the third time, I was promised, in writing, either my parcel or a refund and now on the 4th and 5th occasion (after chasing them AGAIN) I have been told ASOS wont do this. Im a very loyal and premier customer of ASOS who has spent hundreds of pounds with the company and I am astounded that they wont refund me for their own mistake. If I could give ASOS 0 stars I would. As an online retailer you'd expect their customer care would NEED to be excellent or else lose customers. Indeed, Boohoo.com once misdelivered a parcel to me and refunded the money without hesitation."
"August 28, 2018",1,Good at first but now down right bad ....,"First off let me start off by saying that back then asos's had really nice prices and quality products but lately i have been seeing some ordinary products go for around $200 and $300 for stuff i can by at a boutique for cheaper and to add more insult to injury asos's representatives were very rude to me in a complaint ( which by the way was offered freely by asos's saying "" what is your feedback/ "" tell us how we are doing"" ) so i did and when i confronted them about their prices and products one of the asos's reps replied "" if you don't like our services then please shop elsewhere"" and guess what i still have that very hurtful email its sad to see a company who makes millions off others hard earn money just to treat customers like trash we are people too asos's we are people too!!!!"
"August 28, 2018",4,ASOS customer,I ordered a couple of times from ASOS.Always pleased with their products.The delivery takes a while if you go for the ‚Äúfree delivery ‚Äú and the quality of product is decent for some of the items others are amazing. Definitely I will order again üòä

"August 28, 2018",1,beautiful pyjamas‚Ä¶,"I ordered a pair of beautiful pyjamas for a holiday.  They arrived today, they are lovely however, the material is so thin they are see through!  NOT what I was hoping for.  This makes me not want to buy anything else from this company as they are obviously not interested in decent cotton, something that isn't see through!!!"
"August 28, 2018",1,RUBBISH ASOS CUSTOMER CARE,"For the second time in a week I haven't received Asos parcels next day when I pay annually for ASOS premium which give you next day deliveries.  The first parcel I was expecting for my son's birthday, and it arrived the day after his birthday.  The second parcel I ordered on 25/8/18 and I've been told there's a delay and I have to allow until 31/8/18 for delivery, which is nearly a week. I've contacted ASOS customer care both times, and they're attitude is basically 'you'll have to wait' and they've offered no other form of discount or anything.  RUBBISH CUSTOMER CARE!"
"August 28, 2018",1,When the package didn‚Äôt come after a‚Ä¶month,"When the package didn‚Äôt come after a month and the customer service tell you all the time to wait and you do going to get your money back, it‚Äôs not a good service!  Ufter being a customer for many years, I‚Äôm not going to order from Asos again either  my friends."
"August 28, 2018",1,Ffter they sent 2 times the wrong‚Ä¶,"Ffter they sent 2 times the wrong dress, i decided to ask for my money back.Never gonna buy with them again. Never returned my money. after 2 months, still haven¬¥t heard anything from them,"

"August 28, 2018",1,2018's Outdated ASOS Customer Service and Long Waiting Time,"ASOS customer service and response time is seriously the worst, worse than China-owned online stores. First incident: I emailed ASOS about an order return and they only replied it after 4 weeks. Lucky, I got through their online chat with one of its customer officers and managed to get some answers after 2 days. SO, DON'T EMAIL THEM. Second incident: currently, my order (a pair of $50 shoes) is one month late from ASOS' estimated delivery date. ASOS insisted I wait another 7 days before they are willing to ""PASS ON MY INQUIRY TO ITS SPECIALIST TEAM"" and will 'GET BACK TO ME IN 12 DAYS VIA THEIR GODDAMN EMAIL"". Really, by the time they are willing to ship another pair, it should be at least 2 months since their supposed shipment date. Hopefully, my feet won't grow another size. And hopefully, I won't have to return it.  This is 2018. We are so connected by internet and advanced technology today BUT looks like ASOS has missed the ship and is lagging behind. Waiting more than 1 month for a delivery to be resolved is unbelievable. I can understand shipment might get lost or thrown away by funny post people, but the way ASOS tries to resolve delivery issues is ridiculous by today's standards. Quality of Aliexpress and Taobao items might be dubious for some, but at the very least, these Chinese companies are adamant to resolve delivery issues when they are informed of one. ASOS is seriously still stuck in 2012. Last time ordering from ASOS. In the meantime, I'm going to spend some time and buy a pair of shoes from a physical store."
"August 28, 2018",5,Excellent,Item arrived quickly and everything is well made with high quality materials. Their sizing guide on the website is extremely helpful and the clothes I ordered fit true to size. Had to return one dress as there was a small hole in the front; they offered a free return and the money was refunded into my account only 5 hours after dropping it off at the post office
"August 27, 2018",1,"Useless Company. Will be first and last to order from them again. Worst customer service ever, don't bother about customer issue.","Ordered my item on 8th of July and expected delivery would be 18th July 2018, yet till today 27/8/2018 haven't receive any parcel. Parcel is untraceable, useless customer service always delay and say will put to 'specialist team'. I see no different from this idiots.Waste my time only useless company and service. First and last time ordering from them. Do not recommend anyone to use their service or buy from them, customer service is completely useless. Btw if anyone wondering i'm from Singapore Unreasonable delivery no updates no nothing. Pathetic"
"August 27, 2018",1,Paid ¬£9.95 for premier delivery for a‚Ä¶,"Paid ¬£9.95 for premier delivery for a year. They closed my account as I was a victim of fraud and told me to open a new one, which I did. Was promised I'd be refunded but have not. I purchased a new premier delivery on my new account then that was closed 2 days later - apparently again due to fraud.No no one will speak to me as both of my accounts have been blocked and I've just been spoken to like a criminal by customer services. I have paid for 2 premier deliveries and I want my money back. ASOS closed my accounts and effectively stole money from me. Now they won't even tell me whom I can speak to to resolve this."
"August 27, 2018",3,Very on and off,"Very on and off. Some products are very poorly made but some are lovely. Delivery can either be on time or late. Sometimes you get the right product but sometimes they send you something completely different. They‚Äôre alright at helping to fix issues but at the end of the day, how many other online stores get it right every time? Can‚Äôt be that hard."
"August 26, 2018",1,Returned an item,"Returned an item, waited two weeks after I had been told their refund warehouse received it, nothing. Emailed them, nothing, did a live chat, was told I would have to wait up to another two weeks to even get a response on where my refund was. Still waiting for my refund. Do NOT shop with this company."
"August 26, 2018",2,Don‚Äôt expect any help with delivery issues,If only ASOS would take responsibility for their delivery partners. Another failed delivery through Hermes today. ASOS response is we can‚Äôt contact Hermes until after 5 days and then to ‚Äúhang up‚Äù the online chat because they ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù help anymore. So much for paying ¬£9.99 to get next day delivery then.
"August 26, 2018",1,DO NOT BUY SHOES HERE,"I bought a pair of sandals here which have totally ruined my feet. ‚ÄòLeather asymmetric flat sandals‚Äô, I bought these for my summer holiday and within about a week of walking around in them I‚Äôve had blisters and skin has peeled off my feet. I‚Äôd only worn them a few times when I noticed the actual sandal was also bending and the fabric inside them is all worn and ripped. Disgusting! Complete waste of money and now my feet are in agony."
"August 26, 2018",1,"DONT USE ASOS, GO ELSEWHERE","‚ÄòI‚Äôve done some investigating for you in my own time. No house has taken for my parcel and it isn‚Äôt in their bins either.. Myself and my partner are the only occupants of the house, she was at work and so was I so it hasn't been collected by anybody at my address. I have checked in the ""green box"" and with neighbours near my address and haven't been able to locate the delivery. I note that at no stage did I give explicit instructions consenting to the delivery being left in a ""safe place"", as such I would expect a refund to be issued without delay, as I'm sure you're aware I entered into a contract with yourselves, you have then elected to use this delivery company to complete the contract, as such my contract is with yourself, your contract is with me and the courier YOU elected to deliver this order, I would expect that you will need to investigate this with the courier, however as my contract of sale is not with the courier it is with yourself, I wouldn't expect to have a delay in my resolution on the basis of a likely timely investigation between yourselves and Yodel. I look forward to the speedy resolution of this fiasco. The fact the slip wasn't posted through my letterbox, (where things like that are meant to be posted) it was left in the crease of the door, as such I can only assume that somebody has seen  the attempted delivery or read the note and stolen the parcel.‚ÄòOrder allegedly delivered on 15th August and still no sign of it  as of today (26th August) gone to a ‚Äòspecialist‚Äô department to investigate."
"August 25, 2018",5,Awesome service,"Awesome service, I order there all the time. Next day delivery is amost always on time, returns work smoothly. It‚Äôs my go-to especially if I need something asap."
"August 24, 2018",5,asos is great,asos is great. returns are easy. got a full refund. I shop here all the time
"August 24, 2018",1,Awful customer service,"Awful customer service. Extremely difficult to get to speak to them on the phone, and sorting out a simple thing took weeks of wasted hours trying to get the problem sorted. Used to use ASOS a lot, but now avoiding at all costs!"
"August 24, 2018",1,Shocking customer service.,Shocking customer service. Nothing but problems with every order I‚Äôve made! They then block my account with no explanation and refuse to give an explanation. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone.
"August 24, 2018",1,The customs charge was a few dollars‚Ä¶,The customs charge was a few dollars less than the item I purchased some how? The sizing is WAY off. Overall bad experience. Won't be ordering from them again.
"August 24, 2018",1,When you receive the wrong item,"When you receive the wrong item, tell them and then get an answer that you need to wait for a specialist to look through it and get back to you in 10 working days. Then because it was a gift tell them you are in a hurry and can't wait for that long and they tell you to send it back and order it again. You do and two weeks later you are still waiting for a refund! I contacted them again today(14 working days after) asking what is going on only for them to tell me that a specialist will look through it and they will get back to me in the next 18 working days. Not to mention that when I asked her more she told me that there is nothing she can do so she is just going to end the online chat!!!"
"August 24, 2018",3,"ASOS, the stupidity.",What can I say about ASOS from slow delivery to cheap clothes...they do it better than everyone else.
"August 24, 2018",1,Unbelievably disappointed,"Unbelievably disappointed!  have ordered a number of things from ASOS over the years mainly next day delivery. My wife uses ASOS all the time, this will now change. I ordered an item and also took out the years subscription for premier delivery. When making the order I took care to select the option to get the item the next day and as per the subscription, this was branded as free. The only payable option was for next day evening delivery. When the parcel never arrived the next day, I logged on the next morning to see when the parcel would arrive to make sure someone would be in to collect. To my surprise, the estimated delivery was showing as a whole week later, standard delivery. This I did not select and certainly wouldn't have paid ¬£9.95 to get a parcel 8 days later. I called up customer service and was adised ""there is nothing we can do"". Not even ""do you know what Mr..., we see your order with us all the time and paid for the premium service we can send out another pair and they will be with you tomorrow morning, just return the other pair when they arrive"". The resolution, in the end, was for me to argue to get the ¬£9.95 back, and that I will NEVER nor my wife EVER order anything from this site again. It's like speaking to a ""computer says no"" in this sense you will never get any decent form of customer service. There are plenty of other sites out there which are great. Don't waste your hard earned cash here."
"August 24, 2018",1,Do not buy on their site!,"Very bad communication. Ordered items I did not receive, refunds told me to be issued 01.08. I have not received a refund until today. I contacted them through the chat, the agents always state how the case is being reviewed and how they will contact me, even today, and they have written to me for 15 days. I do not recommend buying on their site!"
"August 24, 2018",1,Would give 0 if I could,"They send me wrong stuff and tell me to wait 10 days for customer service... It was a bikini - ordered top and bottoms, sent me 2 pairs of bottoms and I clearly said I don‚Äôt have 10 days to wait to get the right item as I‚Äôm going on holiday.Disgraceful. Customer service is useless."

However when it comes to correcting mistakes they‚Äôre either slower than a snail or lazier than a sloth. They‚Äôve accused me of lying multiple times (great customer service) and also lied to me about statuses of orders. They‚Äôre obsessed with auto responses but they only make things more frustrating. I also find it incredibly rude that they feel they don‚Äôt even need to read their emails, but just respond with pre-written answers Great company when things go right. They‚Äôre beyond awful when things go wrong.Looking at previous response they won‚Äôt even reply to this!"
"August 23, 2018",1,worst customer service don't buy from this website,"This was my first time shopping apparels online and after googling I found out that ASOS was one of the best website recommended. I was impressed with the 2 days delivery service (even though they charge $8). The cloth quality was ok, however, the pant waist size was more by an inch. When I tried to contact their customer service via chat, it took some time to get connected as I was put in a queue. Once I was connected the representative never replied. I waited for more than 40min. ASOS website claims to have 24hr 7days service."
"August 23, 2018",1,Beware .,"Beware .. I ordered a wedding dress from them in two sizes.  I accidently sent one back and tried to retrieve it a week before the wedding and they said  ""sorry"" can't help you.  The problem is they are a UA company not an American company so there is No phone number for customer service.  I simply wanted them to return the dress that I paid for and they responded on messenger ""sorry"" can't help you - this was a week before me wedding."
"August 23, 2018",2,I don't know who I am more annoyed with‚Ä¶,"I don't know who I am more annoyed with - ASOS or the delivery company they are using ( UK Mail ).I have been a loyal customer for years and years but this week have experienced appalling customer service regarding a parcel which apparently has vanished into thin air.Having to speak to countless customer service reps one after an other, none of whom resolve anything has been driving me insane. It would be nice to have one person who just took responsibility for the problem and sorted it out, instead of you having to constantly chase things up yourself.From the looks of things on here I don't think I am the only person experiencing this."
"August 23, 2018",1,Daughter ordered items,Daughter ordered items. Not delivered. Card left by courier saying he left them in bin.  Online tracking said parcel delivered  and signed for by someone in town  30 miles away from where we live.  Refusing to refund. Small claims fouet here we come it seems
"August 23, 2018",1,I don't even know where to begin..,"I don't even know where to begin... I have been shopping with ASOS for years and I have had some bad experiences but usually the customer service team has been helpful, however the same cannot be said on my last experiences shopping with them. I ordered a dress for a wedding I was attending in Spain. They send the dress two sizes smaller than I ordered and when contacted they told me I should return the dress and get another one because the one I ordered was out of stock. They did not offer a next day delivery voucher nor a discount for the inconveniences. The advised me a specialist team would contact me within 12 days (like that is acceptable) to speak to me. Fast forward 17 days later, and I have yet to receive a call from their specialist team, the item I sent 16 days ago had not even reached their warehouse, no refund has been made and they are telling I now need to wait another 12 days for another specialist team to call me back to resolve my issue (maybe the previous specialist team went on holidays or something). In any case, this has been my last shopping with them after many years of loyalty, I have never been more let down by a company. It is unacceptable that they only look after their benefit with total disregard for the customers."
"August 23, 2018",1,Not being refunded,"Ordered joggies 19 days ago, Their delivery company constantly rescheduled and never attempted delivery. A note was found on my close door with my information opened to the public. When I asked for a full refunded I was told it would take 11 days for the items to come back. I even paid ¬£9.95 for a year next day delivery thinking this would be a great investment and I‚Äôd use easily in the future. Super wrong, I‚Äôve been on twitter and facebook numerous times and always told no to my refunded which they know I‚Äôve never even had. Promised three call backs and yet nothing, A week ago they finally agreed to refund the items but because I paid paypal they couldn‚Äôt refunded paypal had to put my card info in. Still nothing I have had to go to paypal to raise a dispute to try get my money back. I‚Äôll be avoiding this company in the future and please be aware that their delivery company still represents them."
"August 23, 2018",1,If i could give no stars i would,"If i could give no stars i would. Absolutely useless customer service. Definitely won't be using them again.Deliveries up until 10pm! that is ridiculous if you're trying to receive at a work address.And you can't cancel, you can only send back. BUT I HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT AS THEY KEEP TRYING TO DELIVER AT 8.30PM, SO HOW CAN I SEND IT BACK?"
"August 23, 2018",1,POOR POOR POOR DELIVERY,"The service from the online chat staff was fine. What I'm unhappy about is ASOS in general. It's my first time ordering from ASOS, ordered 1 item that costs S$36 or so on the 8th of August 2018, and it was shipped out on the 10th of August 2018.The estimated delivery date as 20th August 2018. It's the 23rd of August and I have not received my item. They did not provide a tracking number for my item, probably because my item was too low cost for them to do so. I have wasted a good few hours of my time trying to track the item but to no avail. ASOS has caused me a great inconvenience.I find that very irresponsible and quite honestly lacking from such a big company. They should at least send out a notice stating they they will be sending it as a registered item. It's only today that I learnt that it's by ordinary post if there isn't a tracking number.It's safe to say that this will be the first and the last time I will ever shop with ASOS. I will never patronise your online store ever again."
"August 23, 2018",5,Fastest free shipping and good customer service,"Ordered clothes with a value of 150¬£ the 20th August, it got shipped the 22nd of August and arrived the 23rd.

I also talked to the customer service and they were really nice and quick providing a detailed and informative response."
"August 23, 2018",5,Asos is not poor,"Asos is not poor. Always had good experiences from them. Delivered on time, items are great, website, product image, videos etc."
"August 22, 2018",1,Going downhill massively,"Always shopped at Asos but recently placed a large order - 2 expensive items missing from parcel. Was told by customer services they could not locate them, so they were refunding one (out of stock) and resending the other. Received the replacement, it didn‚Äôt fit so was returned. Haven‚Äôt received a refund for either item despite Asos claiming to have processed them 2 weeks ago?!Fobbed off numerous times by ‚Äòcustomer services‚Äô and have now had to open a PayPal claim as they owe me almost ¬£350 and seem intent on avoiding refunding it.There are plenty of other stores to buy from, I will not shop here again and judging by the numerous comments from others on social media I‚Äôm not the only one. üëãüèª"
"August 22, 2018",5,Great Experience!,"After reading all the reviews I was almost certain I would not receive my refund! well to my surprise my refund hit my account 15 days after i returned the item, also communication was very good with the followup emails from asos that they received my return and processed. I have been shopping with them for 7 years quality is very good on most of the items, a couple of the dresses where cheap material but overall I have kept 98% of what was sent to me."
"August 22, 2018",1,BE AWARE THEY ARE AWFUL,"If you are going to buy from ASOS be aware of the HORRENDOUS Customer Service that they provide specially when it comes to get your money back, I have been waiting for a refund of an item that I received faulty for weeks and they keep delaying it, so frustracting! BE AWARE!"
"August 22, 2018",1,Literally the worst customer service‚Ä¶,"Literally the worst customer service ever. Sent the wrong item, which happens but the problem is they way it's been dealt with - basically told the processing time for exchange was 10 days and if I wanted the correct pair to re order them and send back the other ones for a refund - therefore I'm the one that's out of pocket even though it's ASOS's issue, no compensation and barely an apology. They did not try to rectify the issue and made a loyal customer very annoyed. Up until now I've never had a problem with ASOS - Really disappointing..."
"August 22, 2018",1,Horrendous Service,"Not suprised when I come on here and see how many 1 star reviews over the past few days. Just spoke to an adviser who was no help. Asked for a manager 3 times. Waiting 16 minutes on the phone . Spoke with who was no better then his colleague. I mistakenly selected the wrong delivery and realised when I was notified my order would not arrive until Wednesday 29th August from Monday 20th. Tweeted this morning and was told there is a delay with standard orders which is fine. Asked if could pay to upgrade was told no and asked if I could cancel and re-order, again told no. 0 customer service from ASOS."

And I need them items by tomorrow! They have really distressed me as I have no time to order anything else! They only offered to remove the postage! When I checked last night it showed that currier was still waiting for the item from them and this morning they only now had it! I‚Äôm never ordering from them again!!!!"

"August 22, 2018",2,I was guaranteed my order would arrive‚Ä¶,"I was guaranteed my order would arrive on or before the 8th. I ordered a backpack and school started on the 10th, so I figured I would definitely receive it before then, and if there was a delay there was a few days to spare. The tracking showed that it would be delivered on the 7th. It did not arrive. I contacted customer service and asked what happened, and they said there was a delay, and that I needed to wait at least another week. They would not give me and discount or refund for this trouble. After a few more days the package was shown as out for delivery. It once again didn‚Äôt arrive. I once again asked customer service what happened, and they said they will look into it and get back within a week. Three days later, the package finally came. I don‚Äôt believe ASOS customer service was ever notified it was delivered, because they sent a replacement order. I asked to cancel it and they wouldn‚Äôt, I guess I get extra stuff at least. All in all the customer service was nice, but they didn‚Äôt offer any solutions to my problem. They just sent a generic response (asking for information I already gave them, so this response must be some sort of mandated copy pasted reply) and then when I clarified more they said they will look into it. I won‚Äôt be ordering from ASOS again because it was a huge hassle and I was constantly wondering where my package was and getting upset when it didn‚Äôt arrive by the deadline."
"August 21, 2018",1,Delivered to unknown address. Expected me to go find it.,"My order never arrived. Turned out it was delivered to a different address. ASOS sent me a courier photo of an unfamiliar door at an unidentifiable property which was completely different from all the past courier photos of my actual door. Despite this, they stated that it had been delivered somewhere - so their job was done - and that I should just go and locate the property as it was probably a house within my area. So, with nothing but a photo of a random door, ASOS expected me to go searching for my delivery. Two ASOS representatives have so far refused me a refund. My complaint has been raised for a third opinion. I'm never ordering from there again.This. Is. Absolutely. Ridiculous."
"August 21, 2018",1,"Payed 250, never received the order or my money back","I ordered on ASOS for about 250 Euros. The money was taken from my bankaccount immediately, however I never received the order. When I contacted ASOS they told me they had a technical problem and they never received my order. So I should get my money back. They told me that I did not gave the correct e-mail and they can only deposit when asked by the correct account holder. Because this is my only e-mail adres either it's a typo or their technical problem resulted in this issue. I would expect that when I give them the order number (I can see it at the payment in my bankaccount) and they admit the order has not been send, they can undue the payment. Highly disappointed in ASOS."
"August 21, 2018",5,Good selection,Ordered dozens of clothes here over the years :). Fast delivery even in Hong Kong and convenient return options with 7/11 available.
"August 21, 2018",5,I will never betray you again!,"After an awful Shein order, ASOS saved the day with express delivery before my hols. You never let me down <3"
"August 21, 2018",4,ASOS is always my first choice.,"I always order from ASOS as my first point of call whenever I need anything - with their unlimited next day delivery for a year for ¬£10 you can't go wrong!! Sometimes the sizes are a bit funny, but that's normally if you order from the different brands rather than the actual ASOS stuff - I have had issues with delivery before, but that's normally down to the delivery people, or ASOS make you aware of any delivery issues."
"August 21, 2018",1,Telling me I am a liar and that I am‚Ä¶,Telling me I am a liar and that I am doing fraud against them as 1 product was missing in the parcel that the delivered. Without further investigations they closed my account the next day after contacting them trough chat and just telling me they wont refund anything and if I have a problem with that situation regarding getting my money back I should contact my credit card company. The worst customer - I can not even say - service. Everyone here should read this reviews and they are true! The customer service team is more like human robots responding like they did not even read what you told them. Bye felicia!
"August 21, 2018",1,Terrible customer service!!,"Terrible customer service!!! Completely useless at solving problems and never able to give answers!!! I have ordered various times from them and have sent back virtually every item, either because it is poor quality or faulty!!!"
"August 21, 2018",3,good but i doubt if the products are‚Ä¶,good but i doubt if the products are original or seconds
"August 21, 2018",5,So far so good,So far so good. Arrives fairly fast from point of ordering. Always happy with service and clothing. Returns are dealt with fast and efficient.
"August 20, 2018",3,They always have super lovely items but‚Ä¶,"They always have super lovely items but the sizes are always weird and do not match with the sizes I have buying from other stores or brands.Overall, it's okay as most items are quite cheap and look good!"
"August 20, 2018",1,ASOS SCAMMED ME FOR ¬£40,"I had ¬£40 worth of ASOS vouchers on my account given to me from a friend from Canada. My friend tried to give me another ¬£20 ASOS gift voucher but as he was doing this, they banned his payment method, AND banned my ASOS accout with the FULL voucher credit still on there with ZERO refunds. I asked them about this in email and on Facebook but they just stonewalled me and kept saying i provided the wrong details, (Which i didn't)Terrible company, terrible customer service and just a scam."
"August 20, 2018",1,Ordered an item there,"Ordered an item there. Item arrived 3 weeks too late, wrong size, I still had to pay for delivery and return. Never again."
"August 20, 2018",1,Avoid using service from this company,This company had poor delivery operation. Like scam
"August 19, 2018",1,Lost my wifes ¬£200 order,"Lost my wifes ¬£200 order, closed her account and accused her of fraud. Told her to get in touch with her payment provider. Absoloute scumbag tactics."
"August 18, 2018",1,Lies and evasions,Been as Asos customer for a year. I made three orders in July. The first was due for delivery on August 7 and the second two were due on August 15.I received the one of the packages that was due to arrive on August 15 last week. I contacted them about the August 7 package and they said I should receive it by end on day (Thursday the 16th) ‚Äî needless to say it didn‚Äôt come and they were lying because they had no way of being able to tell. They told me to wait until Sept 5 for the other package because of possible postal delays in my area. I said there were no postal delays because I received a package I ordered on the same day last week. I live in a remote area and order online a lot and I‚Äôve never had an issue with a package or with Canada Post. This sounds fishy to me.I see they‚Äôve removed their Chat Now feature.
"August 18, 2018",1,The delivery for this company is poor,The delivery for this company is poor. I am so annoyed with them todsy. I received an email saying gnwet delivered my parcel and i never did. I have been indoors the whole dsy and no one rung my door bell. When i chat to asos online they tell me i have to eait 48hrs while they find out where it is. They said to check the bins incase the driver left in there. Why would they employ people who leave parcels outside. I shouldnt be chasing companies about the item i paid for
"August 18, 2018",1,Against my better judgement I ordered again after my last fiasco... more fool me!,Against my better judgement after the last fiasco I ordered from asos. My parcel was placed in the bin on collection day! Bye bye parcel. Obviously I can‚Äôt totally blame asos for DPD‚Äôs stupidity but I can complain about the customer service and lies I have been told. I have provided proof that I didn‚Äôt ask for the parcel to be left in the FULL grey bin clearly left out for collection but asos have choose to believe DPD that I requested this even though I have sent them proof that I request leave in brick built shed!. So no refund or replacement will be given. Your online chat is a joke and your staff are clearly untrained and have no knowledge of consumer rights. Have placed the case with resolver to see if they have more luck dealing with your incompetence
"August 18, 2018",4,I have shopped on ASOS for 2.5 years,"I have shopped on ASOS for 2.5 years, made 30+ orders and 10+ returns during this time. Most of my returns were because I had bought more than one size or didn't like the fit.I haven't had any issues up until last month where one of my orders had the wrong item sent. ASOS had the wrong pictures up for the item so when they offered to replace my items, they sent me the wrong item again. It took over a month to get my money back through PayPal but eventually the issue was resolved. I will admit it was a pain in the neck, but it isn't stopping me from buying from ASOS. ASOS offers free shipping and returns (at least in Australia) which is something you don't often get from international online shopping websites and their items/retailers are legitimate.If you are worried, use PayPal because they are often on the buyer's side and as long as you have evidence, you should be fine. Keep all your receipts and emails until you are satisfied with your order. If you chat to ASOS with a problem with your order, screenshot everything (with dates if possible).  If you are returning something, keep the tracking number until ASOS has sent you your refund. As with many places in-store, no receipt = no refund."
"August 17, 2018",1,Really put off shopping here again,"Really put off shopping here again. I‚Äôd purchased a ¬£145 item for next day delivery which didn‚Äôt arrive. I contacted them to be told that they are getting the specialist team to look into it and will be back with a reply in a the next few days. A few days past and nobody contacted me so I contacted them again via their chat which is useless, the staff on there are not very helpful and some are just rude. A few of them even closed the chat when I said about the issue. I was polite and friendly towards them so there was no reason for them to do that. I placed the order on the 22nd of June and had to wait over a month for my money back which is really unacceptable. They haven‚Äôt offered me anything as a good will gesture for all the time and hassle. I had no idea when I would be getting my money back as they said there was no time scale for this so I rang my bank to get them to sort it. I don‚Äôt think I will be purchasing anything else from here in the future because of what happened and how it was dealt with which is a real shame for myself and ASOS really. They might have kept me as a customer if they had offered something as an apology."
"August 17, 2018",5,Can always rely on ASOS,"I've never had a problem with ASOS. Delivered always on time, great returns policy. Great quality clothes and choice. Friendly and prompt customer service (both via email and twitter). Trustworthy company."
"August 17, 2018",1,Really bad service.,Really bad service
"August 17, 2018",1,Poor customer service,"I've ordered a size 12 shoes, but received a size 11. When I contacted them to address the issue, they did not take responsibility of their mistake, but told me that it is my fault if they did not send the right size. The customer representative that I talked to was Alex. He told me that ""I'm more than welcome to return the item"". But the problem is that the total value of my order was more than $150, which granted me a 2 days free shipping. But since I want an exchange, I will have to pay a 2 day shipping fee, and wait at least a week for them to receive the item, so that they can send me back my money. This is really disappointing for a company that seems to have a bright future due to their products. They really need to work on the quality of the services provided by their customer representatives."
"August 17, 2018",1,I had a really bad experience returning‚Ä¶,"I had a really bad experience returning an item with ASOS. I had bought the same 100$ dress in 2 different size (UK 10, Uk 8), so that I could try then on, and return the one that didn't fit. I had asked for an express delivery (15$) because I was leaving for vacations, and needed them urgently. I followed the instructions for returning an item and asked for a refund for the UK 10.  A week later, I received an email that they have received my package, and that they shipped the new order.... with the UK 8 (which I already have).... while I HAVE NEVER ASKED FOR AN EXCHANGE!! Now a SECOND 15$ was billed again to my credit card without my approval, and because I live in Canada and they are taxes for import goods, I'm asked to pay another 30$ of taxes for the UK 8 that ASOS wrongly sent. Of course, I sent an email to ASOS to resolve this issue a few days ago, and they never replied. I refuse to pay for the reshipping to return this wrong delivery, but I'm scared to encounter the same problem if I sent this item again for a refund."
"August 17, 2018",2,Serious warehouse / supply chain issues,"I've been a loyal customer with ASOS, buying on a weekly basis, however it has really gone downhill recently. In the past 2 weeks I have had THREE incorrect items delivered to me with nothing offered in terms of an apology for the inconvenience. One of the incorrect products was actually re-sent to me again - shocking! No number, I usually communicate via Twitter. All I get is a spiel about how to return the item which trust me by now, I know the process!! Can't be sure I'm going to receive the correct item and with the returns period dragging out over 10 days.. might as well shop elsewhere! I pay for premier to receive my items the next day all year round, recently packages (ordered well before the cut off time) are being delivered late! Serious supply chain and warehouse issues. Sort it out!"
"August 17, 2018",1,Don‚Äôt buy here,"It‚Äôs sad that a company as big as this doesn‚Äôt even have a customer service number. I placed an order and received the wrong suit size, it took me three days to get a hold of someone that could help me and their advice was to return the item and re-order it I did so. I return the item & reordered it, i the. receive the order and they got the order wrong again!!. Their response was maybe you made a mistake. They do not take responsibility for their mistakes they take forever to refund you and apparently they don‚Äôt know how to put a suit together and send it out. I have yet to get my refund on my first order now I have to send back my second suit. Very i‚Äôm professional ridiculous don‚Äôt order from here.  If I could give it negative stars I would."
"August 17, 2018",3,Delivery issues,"I have used ASOS before and i‚Äôve had very good experience with them until now. I placed on order on 9th August and chose to have a standard delivery (it was supposed to be here by 16th August) as it has always arrived earlier before. Not this time though! They did not even bother to update me about my delivery status. I had to message to ask them. Apparently, it has been delayed and I MIGHT get it by 27th August, but I should keep it on my mind that is a bank holiday as well. Also they told me I shall get in contact with them if it DOES NOT come and then they can go from there.... I think it is a bit of poor service from them. Pprobably it is the delivery company‚Äôs fault, but then I don‚Äôt understand why ASOS is not doing anything about it as they know their customers are unsatisfied about this service. It makes me very disappointed too!"
"August 17, 2018",4,I am very happy to see such a great‚Ä¶,I am very happy to see such a great assortment of products. The most capricious customer can find something to her taste. The best source of being stylish!
"August 16, 2018",3,Fair,Quality varies but have had some good garments. Delivery can be hit and miss but would order again
"August 16, 2018",1,Botched delivery - and no resolution in sight!,"I ordered a few things off ASOS for the first time last week. Fast forward to yesterday, when Hermes claimed they would deliver between 9am and 1pm. Then Hermes said they'd deliver between 3pm and 8pm. Fine. This morning, they said they'd deliver today. Lunch rolls around and the courier comes to my door to explain that he misdelivered my parcel yesterday and has been unable to retrieve it after several attempts. (His honesty is appreciated, at the very least.) Hermes have now marked the parcel ""delayed"". However, ASOS insist that there is nothing to be done, and that I wait until 28 August, whilst they hold on to my money, because ""it is within the time frame and the parcel can still be delivered"". No refund, no replacement, just... bugger off and let us keep your cash! Worst possible first (and last) experience of their customer service.Update: as of 28 August, no resolution. ""Contact us again tomorrow if it hasn't been delivered, and we'll pass you on to a specialist team to investigate! But there's a 15-queue wait for investigation."" Kafka-esque doesn't begin to describe it.Update 2: as of August 29, have been passed to a ""specialist team"" who will contact me ""in the next 17 days"". You can bet I'll be back here once that happens. Already wish negative stars were a possibility..."
"August 16, 2018",1,asos why cant i get onto the site‚Ä¶,asos why cant i get onto the site without being forced to complete a stupid questionnaire??
"August 16, 2018",5,I think ASOS is a brilliant company‚Ä¶ minus the Hermes delivery,I think ASOS is a brilliant company that I order from all the time . I am subscribed to the premiere delivery which is free next day delivery on any item for a yearly cost. I think it‚Äôs worth it considering all the brands on there! So many different ways to return and exchange items also. Always got quick refunds when needed with prepaid labels and resealable bag. Recently they‚Äôve been using Hermes for delivery which has been pretty rubbish ! Deliveries have not been on time or they have not come on time to collect parcels. Usually this is not the case.
"August 16, 2018",1,Please get your act together,"My order took three days to dispatch - compared with other online retailers I find this to be disappointing. However, this was not even the worst part of my experience. The order did not arrive on the predicted day, and still has not arrived a week after. The tracking message states my order has not even been given to the courier, yet ASOS claim to have dispatched it. I have reached out to ASOS on email and on live chat and have been told that I will have my problem sorted within 12 days. A few days in and I can tell that this will be a long wait. Overall, it looks as if it will have been a month by the time I get my parcel, or that I will not get my parcel at all! My order is over ¬£100 so I am very stressed about this."
"August 16, 2018",1,Worst company ever stay away,"Ordered an item for my sons 18th birthday, paid the extra cost for next day delivery it arrived and was the wrong item . I then rang them and done an online chat as the phone call was no help and neither was the online chat. I explained that the correct item needed to be sent out immediately as I was desperate to get it in time for his birthday and they refused and said there was nothing they can do and to just f me to send the item back and await a refund this meant my son didn‚Äôt get his present and they didn‚Äôt give a toss. Worst company ever to deal with stay well clear if it was possible to give them less than 1 star I would."
"August 16, 2018",1,Holding my money hostage!,"Ordered click and collect, received a tracking number saying that the product would be with me the next day. On the date of the delivery, they texted me driver was delayed. That was the last I heard from anyone. I got in touch the next day asking what happened, as the tracking number was now saying the parcel was returned. Received a terribly dismissive reply from the customer service: ""Parcels can be returned to us because the carrier has not been able to locate the address, has left a calling card and has not received a response or due to the parcel being refused at the delivery address. (I ordered click and collect)We're unable to resend your order to you. As soon as we've received the parcel, we'll refund the cost of the items and send you an email to let you know. Please allow 11 working days for your parcel to arrive at our warehouse. (My funds are being held hostage until they sort the mess they created!)""Not going back, the only appeal of Asos to me is the convenience, and this experience wasn't convenient at all. I have problems on my foot and I only go back to Asos because of their wide fit shoe selection, but with the mess and their dismissal of my situation, it is really not worth it. I feel powerless and frustrated at their treatment. Sorry for the long rant, I am terribly disappointed."
"August 16, 2018",1,I am really dissapointed,"I am really dissapointed. Shopped for the first time at Asos and bought expensive Nike shoes, I ordered size 38, but they send me 37,5. Shoes I really liked but they are too small because they made mistake. Now I have to send it back and wait for refund. Such a waste of time :( I have shopped in other online stores for years but they never made mistakes like this. It is really dissapointing!Btw, I wrote the letter to customer service and they told me they send another pair with right size. I told them specificly which size I need, and they AGAIN SEND ME THE WRONG SIZE !!! How hard it is to look at the shoe and see if it is 38 or 37. Not ordering anything from ASOS ever again!"
"August 16, 2018",1,Order number: 340549940,"Order number: 340549940Worst customer chat help, it is so useless it makes you cry: bought the item on 30th June 2018, it came the next day. I ordered a dress but a pair of jeans came in its place, took photos of the error, sent it back on 4th July 2018, Royal Mail says it has arrived. No refund, wrote to customer service 5 times seperate times, each time asking for me to wait 10-12 business days, which i patiently did. it is now 16th Aug 2018, still no avail. All i ask for is for my ¬£16.50 to be refunded, which is rightfully mine. Escalated to PayPal, no response from seller (ASOS). Still waiting for my money to be returned. I won't be buying from ASOS again unless absolutely necessary. This used to be such a reliable website... but something happened to it and its all up in smoke now."
"August 16, 2018",1,I have just had a ridiculous experience‚Ä¶,"I have just had a ridiculous experience with Asos and having been a customer for circa 10 years, I think I will forget ordering from them again.I received a 20% off code for my birthday which was at the end of July. I wasn't able to use this within the time frame so I just used the online chat facility to ask whether it could be extended for me to make an immediate order (of over ¬£100). I was completely upfront about the matter as above and the flat answer was 'no'. I responded to say the same thing had happened with Feelunique and they were more than happy to provide a new code within seconds. The response from ASOS (Darby) was incredibly curt and rude and I was told ""If that is all, close the window when you're ready"". Awful customer service and will no longer use or praise the company as I once did."
"August 16, 2018",1,Absolutely disgusted by rudeness of one‚Ä¶,Absolutely disgusted by rudeness of one ofThe supposed customer services care assistant GABRIELLE who needs to be retrained in customer etiquette!! She has the audacity to call me liar about missing items from my order and this being me second order in 2 years !!! I have to say I‚Äôm absolutely disgusted in the  email and response! I placed one order last year with you and then this one and your calling me a liar ! Saying that I‚Äôve kept goods when I‚Äôve tried to deal with this quickly and provided evidence to show you that items were missing from my order due to the packaging being wide open! I took photos  and got in contact with you straight away! And now your telling me that your not going to be having any further contact with me! Well the items I received are unsuitable and I am entitled to a refund as per statuary customer rights! I wanted these items for my holiday hence why I‚Äôve been in contact straight away and you are calling me a liar ! I think it‚Äôs rude and extremely poor customer service the snotty email that‚Äôs been sent to me!  Absolutely disgusting !! If I had been placing lots of orders and claim items were ‚Äòmissing‚Äô I could possibly understand why you may have sent the email but this is my 2ND ORDER IN 2 FRIGGING YEARS I SHOWED YOU PHOTOSOF HOW THE PACKAGE WAS GIVEN TOME AND WHAT ITEMS WERE INSIDE!Further more I‚Äôve since refunded the 5 items took pictures of what I was returning and a picture of the proof of postage and yet I‚Äôve still only been refunded for 3 pairs of shoes!!! What the actually FRIGG!! The. Complete incompetence of this company is shocking !
"August 15, 2018",1,Worse company ever... would like to give zero stars,This is the worse company ever!! Ordered a size 14 cami top and they sent me a 18!! Contacted customer service and they said they would get back to me in 12 days even though I said I needed this item for Saturday and it was there mistake. All I got was an apologie and asked to send it back for a refund in 12 days. I have ordered from several websites and these mistakes do arise sometimes but everytime these other company‚Äôs have rectified there mistakes immediently and sent out another replacement. Next even have my husband ¬£40 compensation for a mistake they made and sent out a replacement. This company clearly doesn‚Äôt care that they have ruined my holiday by sending out a top 2 sizes to big! The incompetence of this company is utterly appalling. The customer service here use to be great but this is a complete and utter joke.
"August 15, 2018",1,worst company!!!,worst company!!!! AVOID !!!! they use to have good customer service skills but nowadays it the worst company I've ever seen.they wont refund my items or give the money back after only 4 days purchasing!
"August 15, 2018",1,I wish I could give this company 0‚Ä¶,"I wish I could give this company 0 stars. 2 of my bridesmaids ordered their dresses from this site. The first dress ordered was the Maya Maternity Embellished Maxi Dress. She received it in good timing and we were super excited but upon opening it we realized it was completely wrong. The beading, actual color of the dress, material, everything was completely wrong. The beading was coming off of it and just dangling all over the top. I reached out to customer service who said I‚Äôd hear back in 10 days. Never heard back. My other bridesmaid ordered a Maya Cami Embellished Top Maxi in size 8. She received a long sleeve sequined gown. We contacted customer service who said they‚Äôd let us know in 10 days. She went ahead and returned it and ordered the correct dress AGAIN, in a 6. She received the dress in good time but it was completely destroyed. Looked like someone picked all the beading off. Neither of them have gotten their refunds, as of yet, and are out $300 between the two of them. We‚Äôve been forced to find different dresses in a short amount of time and have really been put in a bad position. There‚Äôs no contact number for the US and customer service literally does NOTHING. I do not recommend this company and feel like I‚Äôve been scammed."
"August 15, 2018",1,They don't care about keeping relationships alive,"Used ASOS for about 10 years. Ordered a gorgeous embellished bodysuit in a size 8. It arrived and went to try it on and it was a size 6 - guess what? They'd ran out of stock so I couldn't get the correct size - was livid! It was a very long winded customer service conversation before telling me to just return it and get a refund, no voucher or anything to compensate - I find that pretty poor as it does make you think twice about bothering with them, they must not care about customer retention because they're so big."
"August 15, 2018",1,Worst delivery company. Hermes!,Asos is a good business but they have got to stop using hermes for deliveries. It is nothing but disappointment when i find out my order will be sent through hermes. I placed an order on 12th August.  Rather early during the day which was meant to be a gift on the following day. Did not receive the hourly slot during the day and i was concerned it wont arrive. Chat to asos customer service and they said it should come betwren 7am and 10pm. However i knew this wont happen knowing hermes bad service. As predicted the item did not arrive and i was not pleased. Then the next day i got the delivery slot for between 11 am and 1pm and the parcel only got delivered at 5pm. I do not know why hermes is a functioning company still.  Their service is bad and it reflects bad on companies that use them.
"August 15, 2018",1,Absolutely disgraceful service,"Absolutely disgraceful service. I ordered on the 20/7/18 and received an incomplete order. I notified customer service and they took a week to respond by a generic email which is pathetic and doesn‚Äôt answer a single thing. I emailed customer service again a week later to see the status of my missing item, waited another week for a response saying they are just so busy and that they had refunded me on the 8th of August. Well guess what today is the 15/8/18 and I still haven‚Äôt received my refund. So contact customer support again to be told today they will be sending me a replacement a month later. I have no faith in ASOS anymore. And I will be spending my money elsewhere as this site is in absolute shambles.I have zero faith that I will ever receive my replacement item for their mistake. Nor will I ever see my money again.If you want dog crap service shop here. If you don‚Äôt want dissatisfaction avoid ASOS.Absolutely horrible to say the least. I would never recommend ASOS to anyone. They have no respect for their customers it‚Äôs all about the money in there bank account at the end of the day.ASOS you should be ashamed of your company. If I could have given no stars I would have."
"August 14, 2018",1,Nope.,"Tracking number never worked even after it was supposedly ""shipped"", package never showed up, customer service just repeated the same thing to me over and over. Will not be purchasing from here again."
"August 14, 2018",2,Really Bad Experience,"Really bad experience. I was due to receive my order on 3rd August (paid for next day delivery) and that was confirmed via the usual text and email. It didn't arrive and when I sent an email query I received a response to say it would be with me by 9th August or before. It didn't arrive so I sent another email mail to receive one back saying they couldn't access the information so they would get back to me within 48 hours...I then called them to be told that as the tracking information did not go past the 2 August they could re-order or refund. I elected to re-order. I then received another email to say they've passed it to their specialist team and I would get a response in 12 days!?!I contacted them again to ask if they had re- ordered as advised on the phone, to be told no, and that they'd let me know when they had an update. I have now asked for a refund and we shall see how long that takes. Quite staggering from a big company in this day and age.It's a real shame as I like their stuff, but this is appalling customer service that has destroyed my confidence in purchasing anything else in future (I've used them several times and paid for premium delivery). I accept things sometimes get lost, but the timelines for responses (48 hours, 12 days) and the lack of any real reasoning is terrible in my view.Update:Package now received (it was in fact re-ordered?!). Hopefully it won't happen again..."
"August 14, 2018",1,Absolutely appaling customer service,Absolutely appaling customer service . An item has not been delivered and they can't find it . 25 minutes of automated customer responses and I've gotten nowhere . I'll never order anything from them again
"August 14, 2018",1,Dress arrived torn customer service ignoring me,Received my order last week. One dress was torn the other looked nothing like on website. Customer service promised to reimburse me for the 5 euro cost of repair then sent me another message saying a specialist team has to decide - after first giving me go ahead. They stooped answering my messages about either dress and im left out of pocket. Feel totally fooled and abused.
"August 14, 2018",3,Premium delivery not very premium,Great product selection and efficient platform however at every point of ordering they push Asos premium ¬£9.95 (which gives you next day delivery for a year) down your throat so I thought I might as well just get it.. However the next day when I was due to receive my order after being told it was on it's way they emailed again saying it would now be delivered a day later??? Why push people to get premium next day delivery when you can't in fact manage to do this? My clothes were great though when they eventually arrived.
"August 14, 2018",1,Appalling customer service,"Appalling customer service. No way to escalate a valid, unresolved complaint. Customer service department just send same old, automated responses without actually reading the complaint. Different person replying each time. No one offering apology or resolution. One lost parcel, no refund, sent a replacement I didn‚Äôt want, lost that one too. Almost a month with no refund, and every time I get in touch I‚Äôm dealt with rudely.

"August 14, 2018",5,"Choice, choice and more choice","For a very tall woman, I love have lots and lots of choice for things to be able to buy. In a world where tall clothes sections in shops seem to have less and less choice I can always rely on ASOS to have trousers that fit!"
"August 13, 2018",2,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICES,"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICES! I've had so many issues with deliveries! When you speak to their online chat service it's like speaking to a robot, except a robot would show more initiative! I spoke to 'Richard' who literally copied and pasted his responses and then did his best to get rid of me! This company is now so big that they no longer care about the customer, which in my opinion is the worst thing you can do as a company.Luckily there's plenty of other online clothes companies around now!"

I placed my order last July 1, 2018 it's already August 13,2018 it's been more than a month that my items are flying somewhere. I send an email, I chat with a customer care and they are all bullsh*tting me. When it didn't arrive July 19th (the suppose arrival) I messaged them then they told me wait till August 9 maybe there is a delay, then comes August 9 it didn't arrive, I chat with a customer care who just told me he will forward it to the technical wait for 10days and just told me I can't answer any of you queries anymore I'll end the chat. What the F!!!! They can't even give me a tracking number for F-sake. What after it leaves their warehouse they don't know where it is!!! And they will just hang you to wait and wait and wait. I'm asking them to just return my money and NOTHING. Literally NOTHING RESPOND!!!!"

"August 12, 2018",1,Horrible customer service,Horrible customer service. Stay away from ordering here. I was on the phone trying to fix an order to no avail.
"August 11, 2018",1,Should do better,Terrible couriers. Unacceptably late and delayed refunds issued following items returned. Rude customer services who ‚Äúhelp‚Äù by telling you to just wait 10-12 days. I‚Äôm close to shopping elsewhere out of principle
"August 11, 2018",1,Terrible experience,"Terrible experience. My order of more than $300 was never received. After more than 2.5 months, i get no response from ASOS and no refund. Extremely untrustworthy. They‚Äôre too cheap with their ‚Äòfree shipping ‚Äò and you don‚Äôt get a tracking number. I guess that makes up a good excuse for them to avoid responsibility when the orders get lost"
"August 11, 2018",1,I have ordered from Asos for the past‚Ä¶,"I have ordered from Asos for the past several years and always had such a wonderful experience and loved the clothes until recently! I had to return two different parcels in one go! I tracked and traced it and seen it had been returned to them! I contacted the team via Facebook messenger and they were helpful. However I finally received an email about one of my returns, they had got the returns wrong. So I contacted them on chat now and the member of staff at the other end was very helpful and said as it was only issued today that they couldn‚Äôt help for 24 hours. They reassured me that I would be able to get in contact 24/7 365 days a year! I contacted them again today to which I was told it‚Äôs gone to the specialist team to be investigated and I‚Äôll recieve and email in 12 days I asked if that meant I would have to wait even longer for my refund to which they couldn‚Äôt answer and ended the chat! Does it surprise anyone why there refund department is so busy? I am absolutely disgusted with there attitude! THEY ARE ALL TO QUICK TO TAKE THE MONEY BUT TO REFUND IT IS A DIFFERENT STORY! There answer currently as to why it all takes so long is that they are busy! AREN‚ÄôT WE ALL! I am still waiting for them to process my second return! I have my receipts as proof of return!"
"August 11, 2018",5,"Easy, reliable, on-line shopping with easy returns","Have shopped so many times with ASOS. I find their clothing hit and miss, but I can't fault the shopping experience. I've always received my order promptly, shipping is free, and returns and free and easy."
"August 10, 2018",1,Awful customer service,"Until now, I have been a fairly frequent asos customer and if I‚Äôm being honest, I‚Äôve never really had any problems.  But I‚Äôve just experienced how poorly asos react when things go wrong and I‚Äôll definitely be wary of shopping with them in future.  In June, I ordered a beautiful True Decadence dress that I intended to wear to a wedding. My order arrived in reasonable time - great! But that‚Äôs where the positive ends.  The item I received wasn‚Äôt the beautiful dress I had ordered but was a vaguely similar, cheap and nasty looking alternative.  The item on the invoice matched my order but the dress I received didn‚Äôt.  At this point I didn‚Äôt worry too much.  Yes it‚Äôs frustrating but mistakes happen and I had a few weeks to go until the wedding. I logged straight onto the online chat and spoke to a customer service advisor for the best part of an hour.  The replies were slow, generic and totally unhelpful. He suggested I order the item again but other than that, nothing could be done until my case was investigated by the ‚ÄòSpecialist Team‚Äô and that I would receive a response within 14 days.  Needless to say, I did not hear within 14 days. And despite my chasing, I received no response until day 29.  It was no surprise that the original dress was now out of stock.  By this point, the wedding had past, I had worn another dress and didn‚Äôt want anything more than an apology and a refund. Six weeks later, I am still waiting to receive my refund and have lost all hope of an apology.  Asos take an interesting stance of blaming the customer when they are clearly at fault. Please just show your customers some respect, admit your error, apologise and sort it out - it‚Äôs really not too much to ask!"
"August 10, 2018",1,Horrible service,"Horrible service, neither I got my package or a refund.... the order was a value of $200 The only thing they said was that there was a problem on my delivery and would get in touch laterNever heard of them anymore.Horrible customer service Don‚Äôt ever buying from them again"
"August 09, 2018",1,This company is the worst I have come‚Ä¶,"This company is the worst I have come across, proper thieves I placed an order which was not delivered to me as they said it was a tech problem on their part. I am still waiting for my refund, every time I call they say they are refunding me but don't its been a month. Customer service is disgraceful some of them don't know how to tackle a situation professionally and don't have a clue. Stay away from this company. Fed up with what they have done to me idiots. Ps I will never get my refund, give up."
"August 09, 2018",2,Pointless Customer Service,"Pointless Customer Service, can't actually solve any issue that is likely to come up. they ship items late, refuse to redirect items. typical computer says no culture. I've had to return items because they sent me the wrong size and because the items look nothing like they do on their website. Good deals on occasion but far from risk free."
"August 09, 2018",2,waste of money,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, i love asos, but i‚Äôm so disappointed in my recent order. I purchased ¬£10 triangle earrings and i was so excited to get them. They arrive and they‚Äôre around the size of a 10p coin, they don‚Äôt go through the ear, they‚Äôre easily bendable/breakable and they don‚Äôt have a secure clip (no butterfly back or anything). I‚Äôm quite annoyed to be honest and i can‚Äôt even get a refund."
"August 09, 2018",1,Sent the wrong product,Sent the wrong product. Delayed response with customer service. Making me jump through hoops to return incorrect product. I've given up trying to get original products.
"August 09, 2018",1,This company provides beyond the worst‚Ä¶,This company provides beyond the worst level of customer service that I have EVER received. They will mess up on your shipment and provide no refund or legitimate explanation for the issue aside from asking that you just wait and follow-up with them even after 7 after refusing to allow you to speak with management to address your concerns. I've had multiple issues with asos in regards to their fraudulent shipping notices and poor customer service. I am looking to file a civil suit  that I am sure will benefit many that have had to deal with the extremely unfortunate event of having to contact asos for any reason.
"August 09, 2018",1,"Has Gone Down The Hill In Recent Years - Sadly, Not Good :(","I must say, after having been with ASOS for 7 years and never having an issue I am now not sure at all if I will order again. Bought an outfit I needed for Friday on Monday and as a Premier Delivery member was eligible for Next Day delivery. Nothing has been delivered to me, the customer care are quite rude, closed the chat on me without even apologizing because ""there is nothing more they can help with"" and won't even provide an update on redelivery saying ""once we know more we will be in touch"". They also won't cancel my order or refund me the money - I can only wait for this to someday get to me. I am now out of pocket AND have nothing to wear. It wouldn't be a big drama otherwise, but I am pregnant and putting together a maternity outfit can be quite tricky with normal clothes, especially in the bottoms department. So overall just really not a very good service. Will be trying Silkfred!"
"August 09, 2018",1,such a bad service,"such a bad service, bad customer support that hangs up on you.delayed deliveries.do not order from asos!!!!!"
"August 08, 2018",1,Not received.,Delayed dispatch by 3 days. Poor courier which lie about attempted delivery. Unhelpful customer service. Now 7 days late and been told to wait another 8 not confident i will receive. I will never use ASOS again.
"August 08, 2018",1,Super bad customer service,Super bad customer service. I ordered 14 items without a discount code. I contacted them to add the discount code and they said I had to cancel the order and re-order. Are you kidding me? The time it would take?!! Can't anyone at the company simply apply a discount code to an order that was placed 10 seconds ago? Chat reference #14958487
"August 08, 2018",1,Do not bother using asos,Do not bother using asos. Terrible customer service. Still waiting for an item that was supposed to be here yesterday as paid next day delivery. The company hasn't even bothered trying to deliver the item and I've been told I have to wait a week to get a refund. They won't contact the delivery company and when I try no one picks up. Full of stupid teenagers reading from a script. Will never use again
"August 08, 2018",1,ASOS HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE,"My parcel has been missing for over a month, the chat service on asos is 1000% AUTOMATED responses they don't care about their customers are refusing to issue me a refund the most they say is ""we have sent the problem to our specialist team they will be in touch in 10 days"" NOTHING ! It's been a month and NOTHING! I'm usually quite happy with asos but when you don't receive your parcel they are THE WORST company I've ever had to deal with! Alongside their delivery UK MAIL !!!! Still going to fight for my money back but I would not trust this company at all !"
"August 08, 2018",1,Unacceptable customer service,"Unacceptable customer service. A week later than the scheduled arrival date, the package has not arrived. They have not provided a tracking number! I went to their site for assistance and they suggested I wait a further two weeks before contacting them again! RIDICULOUS"
"August 08, 2018",4,Good quality for reasonable price,"I got my parcel delivered 2 days earlier than promised, so delivery service was good.The quality of  Items i ordered is not bad at all compare to the price i paid. Colors were like on picture, size also correct."

"August 08, 2018",5,"Love ASOS, would 100% recommend!","I shop with ASOS a few times a month and I've had Premium Delivery for the past couple of years. I've never had an issue with them, delivery has always been on time and the items are always good quality. The few faulty items I have received have either been replaced very quickly, or a refund was sent to me promptly. Their customer service is good and they don;t take long to reply by email. Would definitely recommend!"
"August 08, 2018",1,Delivery is crap,Delivery is crap. It used to be Hermes - slow but effective not they use Yodel with is the worst delivery company ever!!!! They don't even try to deliver a parcel to you before sending this back to the sender. If you read their policy they need to have at least 3 attempts before that. They are not reachable at all!  Rude drivers. If you manage to call them trust me you will waste more time! UNACCEPTABLE
"August 08, 2018",2,I didn't have issues with delivery but‚Ä¶,I didn't have issues with delivery but the quality is cheap for how much you pay. The dress I got was $60 but it doesn't look or feel like it's more than $5. Might as well pay $10 on Amazon for a cheap dress.
"August 08, 2018",3,Iv never  had a totally successful‚Ä¶,"Iv never  had a totally successful clothes shop with ASOS.I find there products yes, good quality however I do find them to be slightly misleading and inaccurate to their online site. With places like YouTube and blogs raving about the site i decided to give it a go and found none of what I had ordered fit even though it was my regular size and I bought a variety of different styles. The bikini I ordered was a horrible non stretchy material that did nothing to flatter my body and looked hideous nothing like I had seen online.The pricing can be really overboard you can definitely find a better cheaper alternative shop.Yes their range is great with many many items and brands to choose from and it is true you will always find something you like but definitely do your research before: measuring your body etc and ALWAYS check materials used.I have had a couple of positive experiences with this brand there swimming costumes are great last a long time and have great style and current fashions available.Even with a few negative experiences I will shop with ASOS again as there range is really impressive and caters for almost everybody."
"August 07, 2018",1,Items never showed up,"Items never showed up. Paid high price for next day delivery. And they refused to help me with the order. And though UK Mail said they had never even received the parcel of them, they wouldn't look to check if it was sent and try to help fix it until the timeline was over, which of course was too late. THANKS ASOS!!! NAWT"
"August 07, 2018",1,Useless,Late after by 2days from latest delivery date.....customer service ignore emails...wait ages to ring customer service (must be all the complaints) then sent bikini bottoms in red as ordered but top in navy stripes??? Now another 7 days to replace....useless
"August 07, 2018",1,4 days late past estimated delivery,"4 days late past estimated delivery, poor quality, shoes scuffed and buttons hanging off jacket, also must be the only company where a UK size 10 is an inch and 3/4 larger than every other size 10 in the country, no thanks üëé"
"August 07, 2018",3,Asos has a great selection of clothing‚Ä¶,"Asos has a great selection of clothing and specially shoes, my wife loves to shop there!I'm only giving 3 stars because the FR section of asos takes ages to reply to our e-mails."
"August 07, 2018",1,Wrong order delivered,"Wrong order delivered. Terrible customer service. Can/will not deliver the replacement to a different address, will take at least a week till replacement processed, have to now return the incorrect item to them. No help or understanding at all considering their error. Won't shop there again."
"August 07, 2018",1,Money taken from account without delivering items,"I personally do not have an experience, however I do have a friend who whilst living in the UK had a premium account with Asos and was a pretty good customer of Asos. She went to Nigeria and made orders worth ¬£400 from Asos as she trusted that they will deliver the items to Nigeria only for Asos to keep making excuses and eventually decide to block her account after taking the money from her account and not even delivering anything to her. Blocking her account whilst she was trying to find out what was going on is totally unacceptable. If they can't keep the terms of sales, then the money should be refunded in full. I normally do not shop from Asos, but this definitely is a complete put-off. I certainly would not want to be treated in this manner, ¬£400 is no joke. If they can't do international deliveries or they do not trust orders form foreign countries, it's simple, DO NOT ACCEPT SUCH ORDERS IN THE FIRST PLACE instead of taking the money so quick and failing to fulfill your part."
"August 07, 2018",1,Pathetic customer service!!,"Delivery not received even after a week, customer service keeps on lying that it is on the way, when courier tracking says that it isn't even picked up from their warehouse. Pathetic customer service!!"
"August 07, 2018",1,"Waste of time, shop elsewhere!","Ordered last week when a delivery date of the 6th of August was given at the time of the order. Queried yesterday where my order was since there was no new tracking information besides the original ""order placed"" status.Used the online chat feature to speak to customer service. They were really sorry but due to a delay with the courier it was going to be delivered on the 14th of August! This was my first order with ASOS and it will definitely be my last after that experience!"
"August 07, 2018",1,"Terrible customer service, unauthorized charge","Made an online order and due to ASOS checkout glitch I was charged twice (their CS confirmed it was their glitch on their end) Got generic answers from 4 different people at the same time in Facebook messenger (their live chat was broken), then when the 48hrs was up and it still wasn‚Äôt resolved they ignored my messages for about 3 days. When I posted on to their wall they told me they had been too busy to resolve it and someone would get back to me. Surprise surprise no one did. I ended up opening a case with PayPal and resolving it with them. PayPal were very helpful and said they couldn‚Äôt understand why ASOS didn‚Äôt just refund the charge. ASOS have no CS phone number in Australia. Super frustrating experience."
"August 06, 2018",1,DO NOT SHOP WITH ASOS,"DO NOT SHOP WITH ASOSPlaced an order a month ago and which has never shown up and when tracked never even made it to the courier. They are now repeatedly refusing to refund me having taken my money weeks ago whilst also promising not to leave me out of pocket. Twitter help is abysmal - don‚Äôt even bother, you just get spammed with automated responses from dozens of different people who don‚Äôt care AT ALL about you and the fact that they‚Äôve taken your money! Straight up just scammed! So disappointed and disgusted, I‚Äôm left without so much money and nothing to show for it, weeks of never ending stress and tears and I just can‚Äôt stress enough that this company is beyond awful!"
"August 06, 2018",1,STAY AWAY FROM ASOS!,"STAY AWAY FROM ASOS!Been shopping with ASOS for years now but recently it seems like they went from being one of my favourite online shops to one of the worst I've ever dealt with. I placed an order and within an hour of doing so, my credit card was charged. Which was fine, except I didn't receive a confirmation email that my order was placed. Waited another day, still no email. I contacted them via chat and they said they can't find my order and they would pass it along to their specialist team to look further into this matter and that they would get back to me within 48 hours. 48 hours came and STILL NO WORD. I emailed them, nothing. I reached out via Twitter and it seems like it's a different person on there every half hour because they kept asking me again and again for the same information, and that they can't find my order. Then they replied and said they looked into it and the reason they can't find my order is because my credit card declined the purchase. UTTER GARBAGE, as prior to contacting them, I contacted my bank to confirm if the purchase went through, and it did!! So ASOS just flat out lied to me! I tweeted them again to say this THEN THEY THREATENED TO BLOCK ME. Geezuz. Still no word if they're planning to refund me. Can't believe they've turned into scamming thieves, but that's the truth."
"August 06, 2018",1,Hit or miss,Useless aftercare on a poor product.
"August 06, 2018",2,"Service is rubbish, and they seem proud of it.","I've bought countless items from ASOS, an when everything goes according to plan it's fine, but when it doesn't they're just rubbish and they don't care that they are.On one occasion, I had a pair of chinos sent to me, and I got en email from Royal Mail telling me the item had been delivered when it had not. When I informed ASOS they were unwilling to do anything until I contacted my local sorting office and carried out my own investigation as to what had happened. I had to go through all the drama of waiting on hold with a Royal Mail contact centre, being transferred around etc. I think this should really be something ASOS should do themselves but they unapologetically demand the customer does it. To the point they told me I should physically go to my sorting office before contacting them again.On a more recent occasion my item broke, and rather than replace it, they just refunded it by accident. When I pointed out that I couldn't just re-order it because the price had increased plus I'd have to pay for delivery again, they didn't really care at all.There have been other instances too, but I've chosen the most recent and most unreasonable."
"August 06, 2018",1,Never received my parcel and zero communication from ASOS,"My order was to be delivered the next day by DPD. They messed up my delivery and eventually delivered it to my local Sainsbury's without any notification. ASOS were extremely unhelpful in helping me locate my parcel via their messaging system and kept sending me automated messages saying my parcel had been signed for by someone named John. Eventually I spoke to ASOS via their helpline and they gave me a reference number with which to retrieve my parcel. The customer service advisor was monotone and twice put me on hold without telling me he was going to do so. When I got to Sainsbury's a day later I was asked for a barcode not the reference number and told to return with photographic ID and a utility bill. I asked if my parcel was actually there as ASOS has proven to be unreliable and I was told they did not have it. If I had not asked I would have made a return trip for no reason and when I later checked my email, I already had a refund making it unlikely my parcel was even still at Sainsbury's when I was given my reference number. Bad customer service and no communication."
"August 06, 2018",2,Never Again,"Two stars instead of one only because they have a lot of cute options. Unfortunately I won't be shopping here again due to late delivery with the WRONG dress. I contacted them the day my dress was ""guaranteed"" to arrive and didnt hear back from them for 3 days in which they said ""your order has now arrived!"" Yay. Good job stating the obvious. I want an apology at least. Well turns out the dress was a completely different one than was ordered and the shirt was in the wrong size. After contacting them again they said I should hear back from someone in 10 days. 10 days... really? Ill be returning everything today. Goodbye ASOS"

"August 06, 2018",1,Bad Customer Service!!!!!!,"I've always ordered from ASOS, but lately there is pretty late shipping (or lost) and bad customer service, they can't assist at all. The customer service end the conversation while I was typing about the delivery problem. There is no tracking number to track the order, and the solution is ""they will look for it"" , ""pls allow to wait for another month to be arrived due to shipment delayed"", or "" re-order then the original arrive you can return "" . If re-order ,Customer have to pay again and return the parcel which shipping fee have to paid by customer . Is it good solution for customer which let customer pay more and more ? Such disappointed!!!Customer supposed to get the parcel on arrival date as stated when they order. If your shipping don't have tracking number please let customer know before order, so they can decide whether they still order or not !!! Feel like cheated by ASOS ....Do not comment on ASOS FB page about bad side .They hide some bad comment !!Contact to ASOS via FACEBOOK and ASOS CF but they just let me keep waiting waiting.....Dose anyone have any solution if the parcel has been lost from ASOS ? Because they act like not responsible for it !!!!"

Contacted them again and now told that it will be with me by the 14th????? I go on holiday on the 10th and placed the order well in advance that other more competent companies could fullfil the order in time. I have asked to cancel the order which they won't do. so I'm out of pocket for an order that may or may not arrive. I'm having to shop elsewhere so that I can guarantee that I've the clothes for my holiday.Absolute shambles of a company that I will no longer be using."

"August 06, 2018",1,Shambolic customer service,"I placed an order on the 30th of July and received an email to say it would be delivered on or before 4th of August. There was no sign of a dispatch email so I got in touch with ASOS on FOUR different occasions but apparently they weren't able to tell me where my parcel was or whether it had even been dispatched. Instead, I had to wait until 10pm on the 4th of August to definitely make sure my parcel wasn't being delivered, despite it not actually being dispatched.I've contacted them again to ask what's going on and my delivery date is now the 14th of August, two weeks after the day I placed the order and after my holiday that I ordered for.Every time I have contacted ASOS for help I have had a copy and paste answer, saying the exact same thing. They will not cancel or refund my order, I have to wait until it arrives and return it for a refund.Complete shambles, they suggest I place the order again and pay for next day delivery but I've taken my money to boohoo - I ordered last night and it's already on it's way."

Sent 3 emails to find out what‚Äôs happening with my order which supposed to come in yesterday - no reply ! Spoke to someone on customer care chat just to be told I need to wait another 10 more days and there‚Äôs no option to cancel my order and get a refund. No word of apologies I‚Äôve been rudely disconnected of the chat. Please before you place an order with ASOS do check the opinion of other customers as 3.5 stars out of 10 only proves I should have been smarter and never place any order with them! Don‚Äôt make the same mistake!
"August 05, 2018",4,Have always been happy with all of my‚Ä¶,"Have always been happy with all of my purchases from Asos, I have made problem-free returns and the customer service is really friendly. The website has a good structure and layout, it's easy to overlook and not messy. I'm not giving Asos a 5 because of their prizes. When I started shopping on Asos you could make bargains, like really good bargains, but now most of the items are quite expensive and some items even overpriced."

I checked everyday on the app and it told me they were to be delivered Saturday 4th August - fine happy with that. Just to be sure as the birthday was that day I contacted asos live chat for them to reassure me that even though no had no tracking or email the order would be with me before 10pm - again fine. I was reassured I would receive an email in a few hours to confirm. No email, no delivery. I contacted again this morning via twitter and have been told there has been delays and they are unable to deliver until on or before 15th August. ARE YOU JOKING? Why have I repeatedly been lied to? So far I have contacted the company 5 times and I am still non the wiser as to what the truth is or what is going on. Will be thinking twice before ordering anything again!!!"

Kept getting delay emails. I've made a complaint and asked what the actual problem is and they've said there's a carrier issue. No compensation or anything and have told me that it should be with me by the 14th... just 3 days before my holiday. May not have any shoes worn in for comfort for my holidays. Absolute joke.
"August 05, 2018",1,Pathetic excuse of a company,"Asked for an exchange, they give me a refund and put the prices up. I message them on Twitter to give them the benefit of the doubt to resolved, 4 days later, I‚Äôve had no reply yet they are replying to people who posted 5 minutes ago. I send the CEO an email, no reply. I contact them on their live chat, they end the conversation without telling me. I message them again and ask to speak to a manager, they refuse. I ask for their managers name, they refuse. They have the nerve to tell me they have waivered the charge of the items and therefore they had done me a favour! It‚Äôs taken 4 days for me to get someone to acknowledge me and they didn‚Äôt even confirm they had refunded it! Simply told me I had to wait and they would sort it another time because they are busy?! I tell them I will take this further, they end the chat and refer me to their customer care page on their website! The absolute incompetency of the whole company is beyond belief. If I ever treated a customer this way, I would be out of a job! They are useless! Don‚Äôt bother with them! Save your money for a company who cares about its customer!"

Now before making the order I thought to myself is it worth getting next day delivery? But as I got through the end of the ordering process ASOS said that my order will be with me by Friday the 3rd of August, so ASOS being a uk based company and me living in the uk I thought this would not be a problem at all. So it got to Friday and I looked at the order to try and track it and find that they have only just shipped it off to the post office. It‚Äôs now Sunday and I‚Äôve looked on the tracking service again and it‚Äôs still not arrived at the post office? Has the van driver got lost?? Customer service has been no help what so ever and didn‚Äôt take any notice when I was saying that I needed my items before the 7th of August. They have created a massive incovinece for me that could have been avoided by giving me a accurate delivery date as I would have been more than happy to pay for next day delivery! Won‚Äôt be coming here to shop again! Tossers"
"August 05, 2018",1,Customer service fuelled by blatant lies,‚Ä™Awful company with quite frankly diabolical customer service fuelled by blatant lies! Waited in on Saturday 4th as I was guaranteed the delivery would happen between 7am and 10pm. At 10pm I messaged their Twitter team and complained. I received a response at 10:22pm saying there‚Äôs been delays and that it won‚Äôt be delivered until the 8th???I wake up on the 5th Aug to an email saying it has just been dispatched?! Meaning they blatantly lied the day before. I message them again on Twitter and they told me that it‚Äôll be delivered on the 14th?!Absolutely joke of a company and they aren‚Äôt now ignoring my request for an immediate refund.They don‚Äôt even deserve one star.
"August 05, 2018",1,irresponsible delivery arrangement and customer service,"The service of overseas delivery is so bad. It is my second time to have the same problem for late delivery and the asos service in facebook is not helpful and they only replied after a day. What I asked is that I have the select the delivery type no matter I choose standard delivery or express delivery? I don‚Äôt understand why the order cannot deliver to the address I have already filled in when I checked out but I have to select the delivery type again through a sms from the Skynet with unclear instructions.Moreover, the asos staff told me I missed the time frame for delivery and I have to contact the the carrier myself. Hello? It should be the responsibility for the carrier to contact with customer to make sure the delivery on time. How come I have to contact them myself for every delivery? I supposed what I need to do is only waiting for the order arrive in the address I have already filled in. The sms message should be only for giving a notice for the delivery status or if customer want to change to delivery way. It is not necessary for any further option and please just deliver to the address, it supposes a simple task......Before the above 2 times worst experience, the carrier would just gave a call to me to check the if there a changes of the delivery address. It‚Äôs absolutely so much more efficient and quicker delivery even I chosen the standard delivery. I wonder what happened to the delivery arrangement now and keep let me disappointed for the delay issues. And the online Facebook service never solve the problem of delivery which is not gonna be helpful and just wasted my time."

I get that ASOS are huge and that my review will not stop thousands of people ordering from this Mickey Mouse company, but my wife and I will NEVER order from them again.Order number 346912858 - order placed on 29th July on standard delivery (I am pleased I didn‚Äôt spend more on a more expensive delivery option!) with a delivery date of 4th August. The order comprised of items for my wife for our holiday in spain, leaving on 6th August so thought we would be ok. 5 days after the order was placed I started to chase via online chat as I had received no delivery updates or tracking details. The several people I spoke to were useless, stating that they could give me no updates until the item failed it‚Äôs delivery date of 10pm on 4th August.Well, needless to say it has failed, so I contacted them again, which coincided with a Hermes tracking update stating the ‚Äòorder had been placed‚Äô.I asked ASOS what this tracking update meant and when the item would arrive, to be told ‚Äòdue to a delay with their carrier, the new delivery date is by 14TU AUGUST!‚Äô Nearly three weeks after the order was made! I asked for the order to be cancelled as it was now no good to us as they were items for holiday, and was told it could not be. I was also told that they couldn‚Äôt help me any more until after this date has passed!!!I am a manager for a logistics firm similar to Hermes and based on my knowledge of logistics and supply chain I can assure ASOS, this is nothing to do with Hermes, this is total incompetence on their part!!It is also ridiculous to no state that I can‚Äôt receive any further updates until the order, which is now no good to us, fails yet again in two weeks time! Worst company ever."

After ordering a parcel 5 days ago that should arrive on or before today, I eventually receive an email at 15:02 today stating my that my order has been despatched. Not one of the supposed customer service advisors on the chat can explain this and you are left going round in circles with them stating ""your parcel will arrive today and we cannot investigate until 10pm"". It seems too much of a coincidence that while I'm on a chat to chase up the parcel that I suddenly receive a despatch notice and a tracking number. A tracking number which has no details yet and therefore hasn't even reached royal mail.  Come on ASOS provide some customer service training and don't fob off your customers when you have made an error and not despatched parcels. You were quick enough to take my money!"
"August 04, 2018",1,Awful,Awful! They delivered my order to the wrong address and have yet to agree to refund me! If this continues I will spread the word everywhere. Do not order from ASOS!

Instead I get and email saying it will come 4 days later. Ridiculous. What annoys me more is that the item is even out of stock so I cannot even reorder it, the only thing I‚Äôve been given is a one time 15% off on full price items which expires in 30days, it is silly because I go on ASOS now for a summer sale, not to buy full priced stuff. Anyways, I now have to wait for the item to be returned, which I did not ask for, and Hunt every day, so that it doesn‚Äôt get sold to someone else. Otherwise 16 days from now, I will get a refund, I did not find anything great with their communication and their discount will not do wonders for me. I am still a pretty dress down and money down"
"August 04, 2018",1,My EXPRESS delivery was a sham,My EXPRESS delivery was a sham. I needed an item for a wedding due on Saturday. It was supposed to arrive on Thursday but they informed me a day earlier than it's delayed and blamed the courrier for it (no responsibility for their own service at all). I contact them 4 times but they never bothered to reply me and when I called them they said it'll be delivered next week a whole week after the intended delivery date. A sheet waste of my time. Never ever again!

They sent the wrong size so I contacted customer service to request an exchange.  Instead they refunded my money and said the dress is out of stock.  The problem is, I would rather have kept the wrong size they sent than not have it at all, so I asked if they could cancel the refund because I wanted to keep it.  They said they can‚Äôt and that I have to return the dress even though I can‚Äôt purchase another in the correct size.  It was a terrible experience because I feel I‚Äôm an honest person and would like to pay for the dress.  So now they‚Äôre out $130, because I‚Äôm not returning it.  All they had to do to prevent this situation was inform me the dress is out of stock and ask if I would like a refund or if I would like to keep the dress, but I guess that‚Äôs asking too much of them."
"August 03, 2018",1,Hopeless customer service,"ASOS is all well and good until your delivery doesn't go smoothly, at which point the company is unable to effectively liaise with its designated delivery companies. For a next day delivery the best they can do is tell you they will get back to you with information in 48 hours. There really is no customer care. I will not be purchasing anything from the company anymore."

"August 03, 2018",5,Thanks ASOS.COM,"I wasn't sceptical of this site so I purchased an item for $144.84 NZD... Then I read the reviews and began to fret because the majority are so negative. Fortunately for me I received the item I paid for in the timeframe they outlined - 7 days in total. I ordered on 27/07/18, it went through the delivery process and landed in NZ on the 31st (customs processes), then through to the company that's contracted to deliver it to me. The beauty of it all is I got to see in real time where the package was, and I was able to speak to the courier company about any delays... that put me at ease.All-in-all a great experience, which means I am happy to make further purchases from this site given the quality of the item and the turn around time in delivery. So thank you ASOS for the awesome experience."

"August 02, 2018",1,ASOS...Always Short On Service,ASOS...obviously stands for Always Short On Service!!!  Really shoddy customer care. Ordered goods for delivery within 5 days and was told day later that delivery would be delayed by a day. As I needed the items for a festival I was going to I asked ASOS to just cancel the order as it wasn‚Äôt going to arrive in time.  It then took them 2 days to respond saying it‚Äôs passed the cancellation point and that if I want a refund then I need to return the items once they arrive.  I then received a separate mail saying the delivery was going to be delayed by a further 3 days.  Nothing short of ridiculous and I will not be using ASOS again.  If goods aren‚Äôt going to arrive as per their own dates for delivery then they should just cancel the order and not expect customers to return them at the customers own expense and inconvenience.  Save your money guys and head to the high street where you aren‚Äôt reliant on these idiots.

I went straight online and contacted the live chat team who told me this was noted and they would be in contact within 10 days with an outcome. The next day I receive the most unwelcome, unhelpful, rude and quite threatening email saying that they had investigated (overnight?) and quote ' It‚Äôs very rare for items to go missing and ASOS have therefore made the decision to not accept any further orders from you'.  I was shocked but continued to read on and it only got worse when I got to the end of the email where it said quote ' As we‚Äôre unable to help you further with this, any emails received about this matter will be automatically closed down with no response'. I couldn't believe this is what they considered to be a resolution??? I decided to go back online and speak with an adviser through live chat, as soon as I told them my issue they terminated the conversation! Saying they couldn't speak to me about it??? So now I am left not knowing what will happen with regards to the missing item and if I will receive a refund? I have shopped with ASOS for quite some time and only ever had a few small issues but nothing on this scale. I am horrified with the lack of customer service and the situation I have been left in."

What‚Äôs even more disappointing is the lack of accountability prevalent in how they are handling the situation. This has really tainted my views about them and their brand.

It‚Äôs a shame, because range of clothes is great, and delivery is good when things run smoothly.

I've purchased so much from them that my ASOS A-list says I'm levelled at a VVIP. I know, embarrassing. For starters the next delivery for under ¬£10/year is awesome, the selection is great and I loved getting little vouchers from points I'd accrued. Most of the time everything is flawless.But duuuuuude as soon as something goes wrong regarding delivery/ return or anything where you need the help of an actual human to solve a problem, it all goes out the window.I've contacted them literally 6 times over the past month as an order of mine had clearly been lost by the courier. When I track the parcel via Hermes, the last update is from 11/07/2018 which says ""On its way to the courier"". Obviously it has been lost, fine totally get that happens. What really sucks is that instead of ASOS amending the issue by issuing a replacement order they just keep me hanging ensuring the ""specialist team"" is handling it. All the while my item is now out of stock.  -_-I know as a business they are killin it, so I don't understand why they have given such little thought and care to their customer care department.All in all super bummed and my order issue remains unsolved.

I have spoken to Paypal five times now and they have sent me the invoice number that asos sent them: P-5Gxwg-yq66h-uvm2m-3hj66-ass6a.  This is the eight online chat I have had with you at Asos and lI was told on Saturday to wait until Sunday and the transaction would be removed.  I have followed your instructions and the transactions is still pending in my PayPal account and my credit card has been charged despite you having a business day to correct your error.  I expect your organisation to cancel this transaction immediately as I have followed all of your recommendations since the 27th.  I am unable to take any action with the dispute resolution service within PayPal because the transaction is pending.  Unless you fix the issue at your end and send a directive to PayPal to remove this transaction it will remain pending. My chat reference is 14720775 and I will not take the response of ""wait another 24 hours for the transaction to be fixed.""  If you cannot help me immediately I expect, NO DEMAND that you connect me to a supervisor to solve this issue as what you are doing is nothing short of theft. After this chat I was told that the issue was being looked into and that I could get a copy of the chat if I needed it.  They will not fix the problem and will not give me a timeframe for it being solved.  This organisation is pathetic morally bankrupt and has the most pathetic customer service.  I have only one bigger regret and that is that I cannot give them a 0 or negative rating."
"July 30, 2018",1,"Unbelievably, excruciatingly awful.","There should be a 0 star option. Over 5 weeks have been and gone since I ordered from ASOS and within those 5 weeks I‚Äôve had - a week delay in delivery, a wrong item received, a ‚Äúguarantee‚Äù of a postage refund if I buy the oringally wanted item again (postage refund never received), no refund on the returned wrong item, continuous automated replies that don‚Äôt actually answer my emails, and now have not received a reply to my emails for a whole week. No sign of my refunds, no sign of brains in these people and never shopping with ASOS again...."
"July 30, 2018",1,Thieves !,"Ordered two quite expensive T-Shirts a month ago (Next day delivery) received the order two days later, also the order I received was not 2 T-Shirts but Two pairs of massive ASOS brand cheap shorts and a cheap ladies vest, The order was sent back straight away. Contacted them a good few times for a refund and have been advised by customer service that a specialist team would be in contact...havnt heard anything from them. I doubt I will get my refund after reading the reviews on here. Terrible company. Bunch of thieves."
"July 30, 2018",1,Avoid asos please,"I have spend lot of money with ASOS , les great but once you have issue with delivery you find out how bad and careless thry are , thry really don't care about your time frame and they juat ignore you , i am looking to buy direct from the companies and avoid asos , my name is fayssal haddad,  they can check how much money I have spent with them , avoid them please"
"July 30, 2018",1,Faulty item and they promise to get‚Ä¶,Faulty item and they promise to get back to me but never do. Also no reply to emails.
"July 30, 2018",1,Avoid like the plague,"Stay clear at this company at all the costs. They will promise you a delivery and then fail to meet it. When you contact them to chase they will tell you to wait 10 days. After the 10 days are up you don't get a refund.... they then tell you to wait 10 days for customer services to get in touch.... and on it goes!!! They are a joke and they shouldn't be in business. Vote with you feet or your mouse and go elsewhere, it will save you a whole load of hassle."
"July 29, 2018",2,the shirt ripped at first wear,"I bought few items from ASOS and they sent me the wrong sizes for most of the items including the shoes. Their clothes look very appealing on the internet  but The material looks very cheap in person. I had a big embarrassed moment when a shirt that i bought from ASOS ripped on both side of my body. It was an embarrassing moment to go through as i noticed later during the day and it was probably ripped since i arrived at work. I paid $45 for the shirt to ripped at first wear. I won't order again from their site since i see i'm not the only one complaining about their clothes, delivery and customers service."
"July 29, 2018",1,I would STRONGLY advise people to steer‚Ä¶,"I would STRONGLY advise people to steer very clear of ASOS if you would like to receive your item or at very least, keep your money secure. I ordered a very expensive item on the 23rd July this year, as a birthday present for my sister, the date of which is fast approaching. Hermes was used to deliver the item (first mistake on ASOS's part as this company is notoriously awful). I expected the delivery yesterday afternoon, which I waited in for. It didn't arrive so I checked the tracking details. I noticed, very oddly, that the driver had requested a return to sender before even attempting delivery. I can only assume he/she was running late on their day's deliveries so just thought 'ah well, scrap that one, save a bit of time'. The item was then apparently sent back to ASOS without even letting me know.I contacted ASOS about this matter, explaining that obviously, this is not my fault as I was in the house all day and no delivery attempt was even made. They then told me (via clearly scripted messages) that I would have to wait 12 days or more for them to get the item back and then refund my money or resend it. This is completely unacceptable as I have had my money taken (and not a small amount either) through NO fault of my own! They are now just saying they refuse to do anything to help me and to top it all, cut me off on the chat, saying 'I can't help you, so I'm going now'. I've never known customer service quite this shocking EVER. I get that the problem may lie mostly with Hermes' lazy delivery drivers, however, it was not my choice nor knowledge to use Hermes, so I expected at the very least, for ASOS to say 'okay so this isn't your fault, so we will round you immediately and take this up with Hermes'. But instead, I just get fobbed off. Luckily (the only saving grace here) I paid via PayPal who have listened, taken my side of the argument and opened a case for me and have taken the money back from PayPal (up yours ASOS! :D) but obviously I do have to wait a few days before I will get it back.Just say clear of this cowboy company people :)"
"July 29, 2018",1,"Bye bye money, I probably never see you again","So I ordered a few items the 29 of June, and unfortunately it didn‚Äôt suit me, so I returned two of the three items. I sent it back the 8th of july, and do to the tracking numbers I could see that ASOS received it the 10th of July. The 21 july, I reached out to customerservice on Facebook. I hadn‚Äôt received a confirmation from ASOS about them reciving my order. I was told that It could take up till 11 working days, so if I still haven‚Äôt heard from them the 25 july ad midnight I should contackt them again. The 26 july I reached out again. And first person I had contact with was Aaron. He told me to wait. But I will not wait any longer, and referred to what the first ASOS employee told me, and told Aaron that due to the tracking number I could see that they have received it! And then I was in contact with Luke, Hazz, and Maya, they asked for the same things: tracking number and order number - I sent pictures twice and third time, I told Maya, to read the conversation and that she would fine everything she needed to know further up. Then Rebecca replied, saying she would send my problem to the ‚Äúspecialist‚Äù team. And that I now need to wait 10 more days for this ‚Äúteam‚Äù to handle my case.... Im so tired and unsatisfied! This way of customer service is not okay!"
"July 28, 2018",1,Worst company ive dealt with,"Cheap clothes, rude customerservice, alot of lies about orders and returns."
"July 28, 2018",1,Asos is fine until something goes wrong‚Ä¶awful,"Asos is fine until something goes wrong and then you have to rely on the most appalling level of customer service I have ever seen. I have (or rather had) an account with Asos set up with ¬£9.95 next day delivery and ordered some items to my workplace I absolutely had to have for the weekend. Nothing turned up that day and I then got a text to say that I had requested a change of date and my items would be turning up at my office on Saturday - I don‚Äôt work on a Saturday, so this was of no use to me!I called DPD in regards to the delivery who told me that Asos had requested this change and to contact them. When I contacted Asos they were entirely unhelpful and told me I had to deal directly with DPD and change the delivery location myself. I went back to DPD who told me that Asos have a lock on changing the delivery address and therefore I had to speak to them. When I returned to the online chat with Asos, the customer service rep (that‚Äôs you, ‚ÄúCharlotte‚Äù) abruptly terminated the conversation with me!I then started a new chat where it was finally established that you Asos won‚Äôt allow you to change the location of the order other to click and collect at a shop in the vicinity of the original delivery location - absolutely useless!I had no choice but to cancel the order and order a new one to my house for the next day (Asos refused to guarantee they could get it for the morning so I had to take a risk). This also meant I was ¬£400 down at this point with nothing to show for it.Then on the Saturday I received a further text from DPD to tell me they had tried to deliver my order to my workplace on Saturday and I wasn‚Äôt in, so they were going to try again on Monday. I contacted Asos to find out what the status was and the customer service couldn‚Äôt tell me. *sigh* so used to this level of incompetence at this point, I just said to them, fine, just deliver it and I‚Äôll return it.The order didn‚Äôt turn up and Dpd told me they had no idea what was happening - you‚Äôll find this is the general vibe of the entire operation - so I just gave up at this point and thought I‚Äôll wait and see what happens.I finally get an email to say they‚Äôve received my order back and I will get a refund in 5 - 10 working days - hooray! When I tried to log into Asos to check the status...would you believe it, as a final thank you, they‚Äôve blocked my account - no explantation, no opportunity to contact them, just blocked.I don‚Äôt wish to use their miserable company again, but they should allow me the opportunity to properly terminate my account (remove card details etc) and confirm to me they are no longer charging me an annual ¬£9.95 for next day delivery - otherwise seems a bit crookish to me - I have found the whole experience beyond awful and would highly recommend people use this company sparingly until their customer service is properly up and running."
"July 28, 2018",1,Never shop on ASOS,"I have ordered from Asos since 2016, and the first couple of times, I received my orders with no issues. However, my last order did not reach me and when I contacted them they said they have resend the package. Its been over 2 months now and I have not received the replacement package. I contacted customer service again highlighting the issue and demanded a refund. They claimed they have forwarded my issue to a ""specialist team"" to deal with. No reply from them since then despite me sending them various emails and speaking to customer service. I doubt I'll be getting my money back and I will never purchase anything again from such a shady company."
"July 28, 2018",1,Asos Customer Support,"I have contacted Asos customer support for helping me with a refund that I did not receive. They did not issue a refund and told me I should wait (although I've been waiting for over a month). The worst part is that when I asked to talk to a manager, the chat representative said there is no more information they could provide and ENDED the chat. Being a customer for the last few years, I really feel that recently customer support is lacking on Asos part and I shall definitely think again before ordering anything."
"July 28, 2018",1,Empty Spendings Account and No Order,"I recently made a purchase from ASOS for some things I needed for the following week. I put the order through with Paypal and an error occurred with a message explaining that my order and payment did not go through. I tried again twice more with no success. I decided to check my e-mail and bank account to confirm that it was unsuccessful. My order was not confirmed with ASOS but 3 payments had been taken out of my spendings account leaving me with less than enough to even pay my phone bill this week (I ended up overdrawn once that payment came out). I contacted them immediately on Facebook and was told that due to a technical error on their website none of my order attempts were successful and that it would take 48 hours to sort out a refund and 5-10 working days to send me my money back. I've been offered no reconciliation and I have had to take money out of my savings account (I am lucky that I have some savings) in order to pay for food and petrol while I wait for my money to be returned to me. On top of this, I will not have the items I ordered for next week. I am frustrated, disappointed and anxious - it is unlikely I will ever be purchasing from them again."
"July 27, 2018",1,Untrackable/untraceable courier service,"I am from Malaysia.I was a happy customer with ASOS since 2017...until recently it changed my mind 180¬∞.Like others, i made an order on 28 May, they sent the parcel using an untrackable courier service, it didn't reach me at all, estimated date given was long overdue.Wrote to them many times(the replies were from different person everytime), the solutions they gave were useless. Nobody would ever go to postal service to check parcel using their name or order#!!They said they had passed my case to specialist team and asked me to wait for another 17 days. Didnt reply my tweet. The livechat achieved nothing.Received a message a week ago from FB messenger saying they had sent a replacement order..... VIA THE SAME UNTRACKABLE COURIER SERVICE AGAIN!! this is just beyond my bewilderment!! Seriously i dont think my order will ever reach me.I like ASOS products, but i don't think i will ever buy from it again."
"July 27, 2018",1,Horrendous and rude customer service,"Horrendous customer service. Paying for premier delivery but they apparently just change the rules for cut off so you can get next day delivery. Their chat service just copy and paste a bunch of stock replies and are quite rude. If they can‚Äôt offer what they advertise, they should either get more staff or change the promise of delivery. Particularly as the checkout process also shows they will carry out this delivery on time. They offered to cancel the ¬£9.99 premier delivery but without refund which is goods and service paid for but not given."

"July 26, 2018",1,Never order anything from them again,"I ordered things from ASOS a few times. The first couple of times were ok, I got refund from them shortly after I sent the items back. It seems everyone on Youtube is ordering things from ASOS, and they seem to have good experience with them, which made me trust ASOS. Recently, I made another order. One of the items was not sent to me correctly and other items didn't fit me well, so I sent most of the items back to them. It's been two months and I still haven't got my refund. I've contacted them many many times, but the issue was just not resolved. I will never buy things from them again."

I sent them straight back asking for the correct size. Heard nothing until I got an e main a couple of weeks later to say they were on their way. I contacted them to say that as I was now on holiday could they send them to address up the road. She said someone would contact me in 17 days. Didn't hear anything, came home no jeans, I contacted them to ask where they were she said she would forward message, I said but where are they, no response. Next thing I get an email to say my money had been refunded, no explanation apology, nothing."
"July 26, 2018",1,Shambles!!!,"Don‚Äôt know what is going on with this company at the moment but can‚Äôt see them being around much longer looking at the latest feedback!Terrible customer service, rude cocky arrogant vibe and impression that they don‚Äôt really care! I have paid for year round next day delivery but my order made Saturday did not arrive Sunday and nobody could tell me where it was. I spoke to somebody who asked me if I would like to cancel my order and I said no! So been waiting for it for the last few days only to recieve an email today thanking me for my return! What?! Spoke to some idiot that told me she didn‚Äôt know what had happened but I could re order if I like ... err no thanks! Found out many people I know have also had bad service recently!Think I will avoid from now on!!!!"
"July 26, 2018",1,Terrible Customer Service and Orders Do Not Arrive,"Order is now over 2 weeks late for delivery despite me paying for next day delivery. When I got in touch with them I was told I could not report it late for 7 days. I waited 7 days and then asked again where it was. I was told my query had been passed to a ""specialist team"" and that they would get in touch in 3 days. I waited 3 days and followed up again. I am then told their was an error and they could not look into it and that it would be passed to the ""specialist team"" again and that this would take 7 days. Today is the 7th day so I got in touch again to be told they would be extremely busy and that they would get in touch at some point. The service is awful, the help chats achieve nothing and emails go unanswered. They took payment for this item the day after I ordered it but have yet to provide the item."

I have followed processes, been patient and helpful as much as I can, and yet ASOS are still advising me to wait ANOTHER 7 day!! This is completely UNACCEPTABLE!!! For such a corporate business to treat their customers like this is an outrage! If ASOS have issues with delivery then that should be resolved in their time and NOT make the customer wait. üò°üò°üò°"

"July 25, 2018",2,Shocking service,"Shocking service! Failed to deliver on the day I paid extra for it to arrive on. Then they asked me to ring them multiple times in an attempt to resolve the problem but every time I rang I had to start again with a different member of staff and then we got to a certain point and they said the system was down and they couldn‚Äôt do anything. As I was going on holiday and wanted the stuff for holiday I then tried to get my order to be delivered first thing the next day, however on that morning I got an email saying when the package would arrive which was well after the time I needed it and that despite me ringing multiple times and paying for the parcel to come the day before I was 35th on the list meaning the package will now sit in my neighbors until I get back from holiday and then I will try to get refund. Overall very disappointing service."

Not to mention my shipment had been delayed. All I got was a ""sorry"" and was told ASOS does not offer discount codes or compensation for these types of mistakes, even if the mistakes are their fault! I then (stupidly) made another order just a few days later, and this shipment was also delayed! I qualified for 2-day shipping both times by spending a good amount of money, and neither time they delivered on that. What's so frustrating is that there is no phone number to talk to anyone live. I was again told via their chat system that they can't do anything and that they were ""sorry."" I complained and the woman ended the chat - rude and unprofessional. I'm wildly disappointed because I was a loyal customer and really enjoyed their clothing. Won't be buying from them ever again."

"July 22, 2018",1,Customer service where?,"The customer service replies quickly with canned responses and unable to take any action regarding their delivery other than to say ‚Äòthat they are working hard but you need to wait until the 31st‚Äô. They say that because of their internal procedure they cannot contact the courier (what makes no sense since any company of this size has a proper account with their courier and a service line in order to enquiry further regarding their parcels and also raising an investigation). They don‚Äôt offer any help. Will start a complain through the EU commission to see if they finally start to have some responsibility for their actions. For anyone interest in escalating the issue through the EU just google it for ‚Äòonline dispute resolution‚Äô , just sharing the tip as I saw I‚Äôm not the only one with this issue."
"July 22, 2018",1,Will I ever get my parcel from ASOS...?,"I initially placed an order a few weeks back and when I was notified that the parcel would be delivered (by the courier Hermes) I stayed at home all morning waiting for the delivery.  No delivery attempt was made.  The same thing happened for the next two days and after the third non existent delivery attempt my parcel was returned to asos.  I was told the only thing I could do was to reorder the item.  So I placed an order on Sunday 15th July and expected the delivery to arrive on Wednesday in line with The Asos standard delivery within 3 working days.  The money was taken from my account on Tuesday 17th however no package arrived on the Wednesday and no one contacted me to tell me why.  By Friday I had still received nothing and still not been contacted by asos, so it was left to me to contact them.  The response I received was just a stock reply that told me that the courier was delayed and I‚Äôd now have to wait until the 31st July for my package and ASOS would do nothing until then.  I am now waiting....Terrible experience and terrible customer service with asos so far... surely asos need to consider changing the couriers they use!Update as of 1st August.  My parcel never arrived.  ASOS have done nothing but tell me to wait, which I have done and I am now left with nothing.  I have asked for a refund and have been told they are busy and is likely to take 10 days.  They‚Äôve already had my money for two weeks.  This is absurd."
"July 22, 2018",1,Absolute shambles,"Delivery was ""left in my porch"" but nowhere to be seen when I returned home. Spoken to a customer service agent who told me he would pass this onto the ""specialist team"" and that they would be in touch within 72 hours. 72 hours later... nothing. I contacted them again for them to tell me to allow a further 24 hours as they are busier than expected. 24 hours later... nothing. I contacted them again, for them to tell me this has not yet been passed on and that this will be sent over immediately... I will need to wait another 72 hours.

"July 21, 2018",1,Shocking,"Wow! i wish i had looked i to reviews before i used them! Ordered 3 bridesmaid dresses, thinking they look lovely and at ¬£65 each was very happy! Overlooked the fact they came in a tiny bag and looked so creased! Couple of months later one of my bridesmaids lost alot of weight to needed a smaller size, as the dress had gone on sale i thought might aswell buy a new one instead of faffing with alterations when my bridesmaid lived over  3 hours away. Here's where the problem starts! My delivery date was last Wednesday it's now Saturday, on tracking it on Wednesday it says they'd tried to deliver it on monday but yet my sister (bridesmaid) was home all day and no card was left, 8.15pm on Wednesday i did a live chat with ASOS who told me i should wait until 10pm as their parcels are delivered until then, i was then told if it hadn't come to get back to them and their ""bridal team"" would help me, i told the guy hermes only deliver until 8pm. Arguing with me told me to be patient and to wait until 10pm, even sent me a tracking link where it said they deliver until 8! 10pm came and went, i then get told to wait until the 27th of July.  I ordered this dress on the 10th! And told them my wedding is T the start of August, i gave enough time to get it delivered. For days all me and my sister had in various chats, emails and messages from asos and Hermes was it will be with you in 24hours.. eventually Hermes tell me sister it has been assigned to someone who had quit their job and took it back to the depot with telling anyone, not even trying to deliver! So all this telling us to be patient when they could of looked into it! Two days later, still no dress and I've given up hope it will ever turn up. Asos have said theres nothing they can do and to just basically wait. Funny thing is this it's not just this dress, my sister also ordered something from amazon that hermes still have and Amazon have helped as much as they possibly can and have given her 30 days free prime. Asos do not value their customers at all!"

I then asked to talk to someone, and they told me they would call me the next day at 9 am... and never did, and now they're telling me that it will take 48 hours. I don't believe them and don't trust them. I've always been a loyal customer to Asos, and actually probably got over hundreds of people hooked on it because of me. I'm a social media influencer and will make sure to tell my viewers not to purchase on ASOS ever again !!!!"

I was told to wait 72 hours for a special investigation and it has now been four days.  I just done another online chat and was told that because of high demand it is still ongoing.

On their receipts, it says to not do certified mail as their service pays for the return fees so you get it for free. DON'T DO IT AND RETURN IT CERTIFIED if you must. It has been way over 10 days since they should have received my package but it is insufficient because I do not have a tracking number. The post office tells me that ASOS is supposed to supply it because they paid for the return service and ASOS is telling me that the post office is supposed to supply it.

When I complain they tell me they will look into it. How long do they say it will take??? 3 days would be fine, 5 would be annoying but whatever. No its not 5 or even 10...19 DAYS! SERIOUSLY? It is going to take you 19 days to see why you didn't deliver everything I ordered?!?! I don't care how busy you are that is COMPLETELY unacceptable! I write them to inform them that's an insane timeline for a response and hear nothing. Not even a follow up email with an explanation or apology. Just silence. I will be filing a fraud report with my bank to get the money back. Maybe when THEY come after you you'll start listening."
"July 19, 2018",1,Never ever shop at Asos,"I can not understand why I can  not change or cancel the order, less than one hour after my order was placed. I made a mistake and you only give people 15 min to react???? I understand if the order need to be delivery tomorrrow, but your definition of Next day is not a next day delivery. Today it is Thursdag and my order delivery is on Monday. That is in 4 days. How can you say it is next day?  Why I can not change/cancel the order, the item is not beeing send anyway before in 4 days? I ended paying express delivery by mistake and you can  not help me. What a great service you can provide!!!"

"July 18, 2018",1,I will never shop with ASOS again,"I have never left a review for anyone, about anything before.I have always been really happy with the service from ASOS, until today.I was meant to receive an order yesterday from Asos delivered by Hermes including a birthday present. On the day of delivery the delivery driver chose to send my parcel back to the warehouse as it was damaged. I had no say in this matter. I was only made aware of this today when I checked the tracker of where my parcel was. I contacted Hermes who said I need to take it up with AsosAsos have said that the item will take up to 11 days to get back to them, and a further 5 days to refund me. I asked why they were refunding me on an order I still desperately needed. I was told by the agent to order the items again if I wanted them in time for the birthday. So I have had to spend X amount again to get an order sent out again... The same agent told me to get it delivered next day delivery and they will refund me. A short while after ordering again i was told that they might not be able to refund my postage.At this time I was on the verge of screaming.After ignoring my messages I decided to tweet Asos and sure enough they replied to the tweet in seconds. I‚Äôve now been told that the order is going to take 7 days to get back to them and they will send me a replacement?????? All well and good but they‚Äôve just made me order the whole order again.. with next day delivery.. that‚Äôs already been despatched.Each message I receive is robotic, unsympathetic and states completely different dates/times/policies.These large companies don‚Äôt care about us individuals and the money out of our pocket for their mistakes!!!!"

A women's dress sent instead of a men's jacket2. Incorrect sizes sent3. Missing returns notes4. Returns notes printed upside down, meaning the labels were useless5. Returns going missing without a refundAll EXTREMELY frustrating and time consuming.I've persevered with them but in the most recent debacle, I've been waiting for over a month for them to deal with a missing return. It has supposedly been escalated to a specialist who needs another 14 days.I will be shopping elsewhere from now on."

"July 18, 2018",2,Poor customer service,"Poor customer service, automated responses without any solutions. I am still left wondering where is my parcel."
"July 18, 2018",1,Postage refund on returned items,Try to get out of refunding you for postage when all items in an order have been returned therefore breaking rules and regulations that was brought in so companies like this dont line pockets with consumer's cash when item have been returned .Make sure that you pursue postage being refunded if you have returned full order but also of you have paid for next day delivery you are entitled to the standard postage refund rather than next day delivery unless it didnt come next day like it should have then you can argue you didnt get the service you paid for .....ASOS customer service is rubbish
"July 18, 2018",1,"Used to love, have grown to hate","I used ASOS as a favourite retail provider for years. I loved their products, prices and Premier Delivery. However, for the last few months I‚Äôve been experiencing disappointment with every order. Even having paid for Next Day delivery, they never actually come the next day which has lead to me not having outfits for events that I ordered in time for. Orders have started to arrive with faulty items, and even missing items. Customer service advisors have become increasingly complacent, and I spoke to one today who was outright rude and unhelpful, despite my polite approach. I used to rave about ASOS, but to be honest you‚Äôd be better off avoiding purchasing from them at all."

"July 17, 2018",3,Stay Away Update,"Update: It is now 7/30/18 and I still have not been refunded. Attempted to contact them again. They said they can't help me despite me giving them my order number! They say my order number doesn't match the info I gave and their records. Total joke. They say they will call me in 24 hours. Its been 3 days I have no one trying to contact me. I also filed a complaint with BBB and Asos.com came back and actually said I had been refunded and they emailed me. Lol. I guess the BBB doesn't require proof because that has not happened at all. I guess I am out 52.65. If I was a lawyer or had the means I would sue them. This is theft plain and simple. It has been 16 business days since I returned the items with no update on my return or refund. I guess I will have to give it 30 days before I can file a claim with my credit card company. I hate how they also require you to take a photo of your return label. I literally have no way of tracking the package since they aren't emailing me updates. I regret not doing that. Ok August 22, 2018 final update (hopefully). Eventually someone did get into contact with me. Apparently an account had been created for me however it did not have the correct email address. Apparently I created an account with a misspelled email address (one letter off). For that I take responsibility. However, because of their policies in the UK they could not assist me over this slight mistake. Even after providing my information via chat. If they had called me sooner this would have been avoided. But they took WEEKS to contact me NOT 24 hours as previously stated. The people who assisted me on the phone were helpful and accommodating. I appreciated that. Another issue was my credit card. Shortly after this event I had my card info stolen and so had to get replacement. Well ASOS refunded but it went to the old card and therefore never took place. They CLAIMED it had been processed but it had not clearly because I had no updated info to give them. Not sure why they lied about that. Anyway, after showing them both of my recent statements they agreed to refund me the return amount I was owed. In short, ASOS should improve their returns process, their customer service return time, and shouldn't claim certain events took place when they did not, such as my refund being processed. Although it improved and the issue was resolved it took me complaining on the BBB website to get noticed. Unless your package gets to you in perfect condition without any return issues, you may want to reconsider. I suspect returning in the UK is much easier than in the U.S. Communication with someone is difficult. It is a bit of a risk shopping with them in my opinion and I won't be doing it again."

They do not reply to any communications for week and fob you off to their ‚Äúspecialist‚Äù team who take on average ‚Äú13 days‚Äù to respond. Email gets you no where, neither does their social media platforms. Live chat workers even cut off the conversation to avoid helping you. Absolutely horrendous customer service. I have been waiting three weeks for a missing item and still awaiting to hear anything regarding the order progress. AVOID USING THEM AT ALL COSTS!!!"

"July 16, 2018",1,Worst Customer Service Ever,I needed a dress for a very important interview tuesday morning. I placed the order and paid ¬£6 for next day delivery. I placed the order just after the cut off time friday but was happy to pay because I needed the order by Monday evening. I was promised the order to be delivered Monday by 10pm. Sunday evening came and I had not yet received my dispatch email so I was starting to worry. I messaged them on messenger and they assured my my order would be delivered by Monday. It was now 4.30pm Monday evening and I messaged them again giving them enough time to contact their courier and help me. They said there was nothing they could do and I had to wait until 10pm that night so I waited and nothing. I messaged them to say how upset I was and can they at least try and get another order out to me by 9am the next morning special delivery. I got a reply to say they cannot help and I have to wait 3 days for someone else to contact me. I have been left so stressed out. I just can't believe the lack of responsibility and lack of care given. Just disgusted to be honest.
"July 16, 2018",1,Customer service? HA!,"Worst customer service I have ever received. I had purchased from ASOS on a few occasions with no issues whatsoever. Until, I forgot my password. They blocked my account due to too many login attempts (Which is a positive), but here's the kicker. I spoke to them on their chat, asking them to unblock me. They forwarded my query on to the ""Specialist Team"" (why have a customer service team if they have to forward ever query to a special team?). I have had an email from the ""Specialist Team"" asking me to change my password, which I have. I am still blocked, so i emailed them back to mention this. They said they would have my account unblocked within 24 hours. It has been a week, spoke to them again today and they said once again ""we'll forward this query onto the specialist team"". I am a little worried i'm being conned. It's an absolute mick take. I've learned my lesson though, I will never save billing information again."
"July 16, 2018",1,awful customer service,"Item was missing from my order.Emailed several times without any follow up or reply.It seems they just ignore you.I can understand that they are busy,but a short reply to inform status of that missing item would be sufficient.Applied for a refund without any follow up either.Never ordering again and also will tell my friend not to."

"July 16, 2018",1,Gradually going down the drain,Gradually going down the drain. I have spent a lot of money over many years on ASOS yet this past year I have received terrible declining service. From receiving faulty goods to completely wrong products to being lied to about failed delivery attempts (and most recently being told at 3pm on the delivery day that actually they weren't going to bother delivering) and evasiveness when questioned about reasons for no delivery and lack of communication - I do not trust this site at all anymore!!

Waited and waited for the refund but never received (only received confirmation that they received the item) then got stuck back and forth with customer service who want me to send them copies of my personal bank statement and refusing to provide me with a reference for the refunded payment. Not acceptable and not comfortable sending them person bank statements. Very disappointed."
"July 15, 2018",1,ZERO STAR!! - AVOID ASOS!!,"ZERO STAR!!! I paid for a premier delivery service to have my item delivered the next day - My pair of trousers NEVER turned up the next day, i had to chase them up myself.

When i phoned to ask about how to return the item, apparently, I'm to wait for 17 DAYS for someone to get back to me! - 17 DAYS!!!WORST customer service and the WORST after sales service. AVOID at all cost!!!"
"July 15, 2018",1,Absolutely ridiculous customer service,"Absolutely ridiculous customer service, courier did not deliver my order as they stated they could not find the large Coop store on a main road where is was supposed to be delivered. Order apparently gone straight back to ASOS warehouse and I will have to wait up to 25 days for a refund and then reorder as they cannot send the parcel back out!! What a con, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS COMPANY. What a joke!!!"
"July 14, 2018",1,Shocking customer service,"I returned 3 items 3 weeks ago but was only refunded for 1. I've chased via email repeatedly and am told it will be investigated but that SLA has long passed. The service via web chat was comical- the guy was clueless and I got 4 completely different answers as to the resolution depending in the question. He had no idea about chargebacks, escalation or a formal complaints process. But I'm to bear with them cos they're very busy. Not once was there an apology. I guess they're not in a hurry to resolve as they have the ¬£70 in their account a bit longer. Caveat Emptor"
"July 14, 2018",1,"Disgusting, Awful service. Processed a payment and I have never recieved the goods.","Illegal, disgusting practices- I have shopped with ASOS for years and have never had an issue until now. ASOS owe me a refund for goods I have never handled or recieved. The customer service team is a joke- one of them accused me of requesting the parcel to be returned (I had no way of doing this) and even tried to up-sell their premier delivery service and their credit facility instead of dealing with my complaint. They have tried to push the blame on the courier and despite me reminding them that as per the sales of goods act my contract of purchase is with them, they insist I must wait for the courier to return the goods to them before they process a refund- this is the same courier who failed to deliver the items in the first place!!!! The responses I have recieved have been mis-leading and certainly illegal. In fact it has been that distressing I have sought legal advice over the matter and am in the process of putting together a formal complaint to trading standards and reporting the transaction as fraudulent with my bank. As well as fighting for a refund I am also looking to be compensated for the stress and time this of this horrible experience. I doubt if I will ever shop with ASOS again, this has been going on Since the 2.7.18."

I bought my trainers on the 21st of June and today it's the 13th of July.EVERYONE, DO NOT SPEND YOUR PRECIOUS MONEY WITH THESE CROOKS!!"

Its been nearly 7 days now, no refund and no goods!Shocking service levels"
"July 13, 2018",1,Worst company ever,Service was so bad I actually signed up to post my first ever review on anything. Worst company ever. Don't deliver your goods and then ignore you once you make a complaint and ask for a refund. Avoid at all costs!!!!!!
"July 13, 2018",2,"Great items, terrible customer service!","Although I love the items on the site, their customer service is absolutely terrible. I have received SEVERAL wrong orders from them and they do nearly nothing to fix the issue. Processing a refund from them could take 20 days or more as they will not refund you (even if they've sent you the wrong item and it was no fault of your own) until they have received the item back that they wrongly sent to you. Once I ordered a dress and they sent me a pair of sandals...how do you screw that up!? I will be wary of ordering from them in the future as they do nothing to remedy the issue, most sites will offer you a discount or promo code to use in the future to keep you in good graces with the company but this company will not. It's a shame I will not be ordering from them again, great items, terrible service."

Asos won‚Äôt refund me the cost of the products for at least 3 weeks so will look at contacting trading standards. Asos blame the courier and the courier blames ASOS so you just go round and round in circles!  Avoid Asos!! You have be warned! Asos online customer help is a waste of time!!
"July 12, 2018",1,Unfortunately,"Unfortunately, it was a very bad experience for the following reasons.Firstly, I found that the mail man left the parcel in the porch and didn‚Äôt even bother to leave it in a safe place or even with any of the neighbors. On the other hand I would like to highlight that the cost of my order is over 700GBP, which is a huge amount of money.Secondly, I found one of the parcels is not well sealed. How come this happen!!!!! Which will make the parcel to be easily wasted or got lost or whatever.  Lastly, and most unacceptable I found out that one of the shoes I ordered was used before. Which is also very ridiculous and unacceptable. I‚Äôm charged for a new pair of shoes not a used one. If i can give them a zero star would‚Äôve been even better"

They arrive, invoice states size 9, but are labellled as size 8, I try them on and sure enough they‚Äôre too small. So I contact customer service, explain I want to return and reorder, though need to be reassured that I will receive the correct size and therefore someone should check their stock to make sure I get size 9 and not another size 8. Simple. Yeah, they can do that, but in 18 days time. What? Yes, they cock up, they can‚Äôt check their stock for a minimum of 18 days...... so anyone else ordering will get the smaller size too! Stunning.Who is managing this business, the Teletubbies? ASOS have competitors, that‚Äôs where I‚Äôll be spending my money from now on. Doh!"

"July 12, 2018",1,Absolutely awful,"Absolutely awful. I ordered a belt, shoes and a swimsuit. The shoes are the wrong size and the bottoms were not included in the package (which the shipping and receipt confirms that they were shipped in the same package). I‚Äôve spent over $75 on this order. I contact customer service and they‚Äôve said they‚Äôll contact me within the next NINETEEN days. I needed these items for a vacation I am taking in TWO days. Absolutely ridiculous. Hoping they actually give me a refund or even respond with this supposed email and then never shopping from them ever again."
"July 11, 2018",1,Very poor customer service,"Very poor customer service. Deliveries never arrive on time. Ordered a dress, received wrong one and asked for refund. Spoke to staf via twitter who said another was sent out....I did not ask for a replacement, I had indicated refund. Yet again the same incorrect dress arrived, must have been issue with their listing online not matching the photograph. However this is all at my inconvenience, never get to speak to same person 2 messages in row. Dodge questions and just tell you to post back. No apology never mind any offer of goodwill or compensation."
"July 11, 2018",1,"Poor, disappointing customer service","If you want peace of mind and treated with respect, shop some where else. Use to rate ASOS really highly, not anymore. Popularity + ASOS= drastic decrease in standards. One particular customer care staff could not be bother to try to pronounce  my name even after being corrected. A senior staff response was this person is not a native English speaker. Really!!!! I guess once they have your money you're just an order number, not point getting your name right. Disappointing to say the least."
"July 10, 2018",1,AVOID - No care for the customer,"AVOID - Appalling customer serviceI wish I had read reviews before contacting their customer service, as it could have saved me wasting time trying to get them to sort an issue. Basically, they are not willing to give any customer service. All they needed to do is send the item out again so it would arrive to me in time (instead they say I have to wait for another THREE days to see if the item turns up - even though I paid for NEXT DAY delivery as I need the item in TWO days. So, they had the option to still get it to me in time (as it was ordered for a special celebration) BUT no, they choose to say that there is nothing they can do! I would be embarrassed to give such poor service. Pre-scripted uncaring response."
"July 10, 2018",1,Awful and a waste of my time,"Awful and a waste of my time. You have to jump through hoops to prove you are a student for a discount. Made an account, filled out their ""student information"" and I was supposed to get a code. Never received a code so I got on a chat with them to see what was wrong. I sent them my schedule that showed I was enrolled for Fall 2018 semester, my student ID, my student email, and my enrollment letter. They asked for a document with expected graduation date, I didn't have a document like this--- this may be a USA thing where we don't have an exact date unless we apply for graduation.Derby was the person I spoke to. She was rude, unhelpful and rigid. It was just a 10% code I was asking for, the above documents should have sufficed. I'll buy my bridesmaid dress somewhere else."

Clearly attention was not paid when checking the number and item in the box match the order number label on the front.I contacted the customer service to inform them and was told to return the item and ask for a refund which is not helpful as I wanted the item I paid for not my money back. I asked for my correct order to be despatched to me and was told that it would take up to 16 days!!!!!!!I asked to speak to a manager about the situation and was advised one had gone home, one was on lunch and another was on the phone.  I told them I had no problem waiting and I was ushered off the phone with the excuse that they are not able to keep people on hold even though you are on hold in the call queue trying to reach an agent. Having worked on the phones before I find this hard to believe.I have ended up with no product and I am now due to return the incorrect item and wait for a refund and I am not able to have what I paid for with me on my trip. Dreadful.  I will NOT be ordering from them again as these issues appear to be common place."
"July 10, 2018",1,Utterly useless,Utterly useless - lost my order and making me order again - then someone to be in contact within 18 days!?? Why pay for next day delivery when their issues department take 18 days to respond?! Totally misaligned - sort it out you sorry excuse for a company
"July 10, 2018",1,"Appalling service.  Order never received, all goods now out of stock & still no refund!","I recently made an order for 3 items, 1 for an interview the next week and another item for my wedding.  Paid for next day delivery to my work address, as it is a 24hr managed building so someone would be there to sign for it on the Saturday.When I came into work on Monday, no parcel had been received, and when tracking my order it said it was signed for by myself! Funny when I only work Monday- Fridays and wasn't even in the same city on that day.....When complaining to asos I was just told to wait for it to be looked into and have had to do all the chasing myself! Every item that I had ordered is now out of stock so asos aren't even able to replace anything, and yet I am still waiting for someone to refund me for the order I never received.Appalling service and I will not be shopping with them again."
"July 10, 2018",1,AVOID! Appalling customer service,"I have been shopping with ASOS for over 10 years, rarely do I have anything to complain about. The odd delivery may be delayed or occasionally I've received the wrong item but it's always been fixed within a day. If you do however need to contact customer services for anything I apologise, I have done in the past and they've been rude and incompetent. However again rarely have I complained I work within a customer service centre for an online retailer so I have sympathy for the people who work there and try not to complain unless absolutely necessary. Now it's necessary!On 3rd July I sent 3 items (3 separate orders) back in one returns bag, all listed on the same returns form. On Friday 6th July I received email confirmation advising of the completed refund for one of the items Immediately I chased this up with them via email and they advised me to wait 24hrs and get back in touch, 24hrs passed and still nothing so I emailed. The girls via email were very friendly and assisted where they could but advised that it needed to be passed to a specialist and they'd get back in touch within 14 days. This is an absolute joke, to wait 14 days to be informed what has happened to goods that I sent back in good faith is not acceptable!!I have just had an online chat with an advisor called Ansa and again the level of customer service is disgusting, being a Customer Service Manager for an online retailer myself I know if there is a complaint I should be the one to deal with it. Ansa refused to pass it to someone senior 'as they would only tell me the same' I then asked for contact details for someone at head office. She insulted me further by telling me there was no contact number and giving me the link to the main contact us page that I had just used to speak to her!! Ansa then proceeded to tell me there was nothing more she could do to help so she was ending the chat and that she did.I am appalled at the customer service I've received and the fact that I am being made to wait for a 'specialist' team to look into my query, it's simple someone at the warehouse has lost these goods as they were in the same bag and written on the same piece of paper! I am now being inconvenienced for this. I will be taking this further and I won't be shopping with ASOS again, it's a shame because I think they know they have such a huge customer base there is no need to worry themselves and offer great customer service. BEWARE!"

"July 09, 2018",2,Either hit or miss,"I love Asos and their products but oh my god they need to fix their customer service. In my experience, trying to get in touch via email is always a dead end, but the live chat works relatively well. I've never experienced an issue not being resolved, but it's so tiring to have to always remind them that there is an issue. Furthermore, their deliveries seem to be completely chaos. It's always either hit or miss, you either get it on the day you were supposed to or you don't get it at all. It's very unappealing as a customer to have to wait months for an order that was supposed to take four days. (And also never being informed on the process! You always have to contact support multiple times or you'll never get any answers.) It's sad to see that so many people have had similar experiences to mine, and I really hope Asos fixes their problems because I honestly love their stuff but might have to find an alternative with a higher standard of customer service and delivery."
"July 09, 2018",1,Bad delivery service.. even worse goodwill gesture offered!,I ordered an 2 items in separate deliveries for next day delivery.  Neither came.  Ruined the party as needed them as a gift.  Offered 15% off my next order for the inconvenience.  Disgusting as this is th third time this has happened.

Totally irresponsible and good-for-nothing. They have no idea what they are doing, where are the packages or why there has been such a long delay in delivery. I ordered several items worth more than $500 on June 25th and have not received anything yet on July 9th. The customer service just exchanges email to tell me to check the porch while the tracking status shows that the package is still in the airport. They ask for address confirmation and finally recommend to wait seven more business days to see what happens. They have no shame. They really don't deserve an eye roll, let alone a star!"

I'm an incredibly loyal customer and cannot understand why ASOS wouldn't re-send the parcel like all other good online retailers. I'm absolutely disgusted as this was ordered last week for my best friend's wedding this week. I will no longer be shopping with ASOS after years of shopping weekly.

I screenshot this to ASOS who informed me ""We did state that normal deliveries are taking two days longer than usual"" and I replied ""Oh okay, where does it say this"" and its highlighted under the ""customer care section"", like you look at that when you're placing an order! So I said its obviously going to be late, can you look into this now, ""no sorry, we cant until its passed it official date"" even though I had just explained its confirmed by Hermes its going to late. So I asked for a customer care number to discuss, and was told they don't have one (I know this is a lie because I have spoken to them before), and I said Id rather talk in person, next thing ""here is your customer ref number for this chat, please close the chat when you are ready""....

They have no problem solving skills as every time they get contacted, they come up with a later date for you to wait for an answer. Now they have delayed the date of giving me an update for the third time, whilst I have found out my package is only some miles away from me at a logistic terminal, it really makes me mad. Instead of writing me to wait 11 or 12 more days, they could have called the terminal as I asked them to.... I have given up on shopping from ASOS."

I‚Äôve been told to wait minimum of 12 days until they investigate what happened.My question is why ASOS is not meeting my request as a customer to give me a refund since it‚Äôs their fault that my parcel is lost  and also they failed to comply with the purchased Next Day Delivery service.  It is simple, if you don‚Äôt deliver as promised, customers ask for refund.Also the customer service of ASOS has been extremely rude and useless, I am not even sure if I would get my refund at all. Not only that but I wasn‚Äôt even offered any voucher or discount for the company‚Äôs incompetence. My case was seen by the customer support representative as simply an ‚Äúinconvenience‚Äù that my order is gone. Very disappointed by the whole customer experience. i wouldn‚Äôt use them EVER again!"

Their system let me cancel the original order, but when I reordered the system said the voucher had already been used. OK, I can sort of see their logic, but in effect I have now not used the voucher. I contacted their Customer Support, and basically got told ""tough"".

Asos is an online shop one thing they should have on point is their delivery services. I am very disapointed as i paid and I do not know where my package is and their costumer service is very very slow.

"July 03, 2018",5,I LOVE ASOS,"After having some terrible experiences shopping with other outlets lately and ranting about them on here, it made me realise how efficient ASOS is so wanted to share my opinion. They have become my number one go-to place for all clothes, sportswear, underwear, shoes everything. I've been using them since they launched which was years ago now and the range keeps getting better and better. I always check other outlets when online shopping to look for the best price and ASOS seems to always be competitive and even if they weren't I'd probably shop with them anyway as I trust them and it's always an easy process which is so important when online shopping.They make it so easy to return items and I've never had an issue with being refunded (and quickly). I live rurally and I trust ASOS enough to buy huge orders worth hundreds of pounds in different sizes and styles so I can try everything on at home knowing they'll be no problem returning and getting my money back on any items I don't want to keep. I know this sounds like it should be the basics, but if you read my reviews of House of Fraser or Uniqlo you'll realise some companies make returning things a nightmare - if they even arrive to begin with! Also this brilliant customer service is coupled with a really easy to use website which looks great, really cute write-ups for the items and a massive amount of choice in terms of style, sizes, brands, prices."

Used the chat service (where the woman took ten minutes to reply to every question) and asked what was happening. She told me should would inform the relevant department and I should hear back within 7 days. I asked what normally happens in cases like this (would I be sent a replacement item if it was damaged? etc) and all she would say was ""the other department will tell you that."" They take your money, often don't deliver (this isn't the first time this has happened to me), and then won't give you any answers or resolutions on the chat service.

I was confused that I recieved 2 emails.My next day order never arrive. I called UK mail and they said it would be delivered on the 28 June istead as they hadn't received it yet. It didn't arrive on this day either. I contacted ASOS  (28th June) to ask about my order and the agent was rude and cut me off when I asked for compensation and didn't sort my order out. I contacted ASOS once again at roughly 9pm and was told that my order would be delivered by 10pm or by the next day.I keep checking the tracking on both DPD and UK mail and neither say they have received the package or have any tracking after the line that says your parcel will be with us soon etc.Next day delivery has so far taken 3 days. I have been told it was delivered and signed by me at 6.30pm when I was in my room and window is next to the front door. So know one knocked at all.
"June 29, 2018",1,Unacceptable horrible service,"Unacceptable customer service. Since I reside in the US, I only have the option to chat or email. I opted for a chat for faster response. Lo and behold, nothing was resolved. Package said delivered but was not there. Spoke with a chat agent and said the investigations team will follow up within 48 hours. How long does it take to actually look into it. I have not gotten a response yet and followed up again. It has been 3 days. They will just give you lies and push the timeline to 6 DAYS. Will just give stupid excuses. Will not issue you a refund nor answer your questions. And yes, they will close the chat on you and when you return for another agent, they will transfer you to Sarah who never responds.  DECEPTIVE and ABUSIVE. You should fire Charlotte and Harry. There is no customer service or care without service or care!!!!!!!"

Why would I waste time looking at their stuff and placing an order if they can't even ensure it is delivered.  I think them trying to cut costs has significantly reduced the quality of their site to the point where I don't even trust them anymore. I am done with ASOS.

They then tell me to try and reorder using a different payment method? Seriously? Yes, that's what i want to do, give you more money - not!

""Customs or import duties are charged once the parcel reaches its destination country. These charges must be paid by the recipient of the parcel. We have no control over these charges, and can't tell you what the cost would be, as customs policies and import duties vary widely from country to country. It's a good idea to contact your local customs office for current charges before you order in the future, so you're not surprised by charges you weren't expecting."" Who can expect about the import duties without note!They must have so many inquiry from people who has same trouble before but they don't mention on their website. So kind, huh?They allow canceling the order only in 15 mins after we order.The merchandise was completely different from the pictures. Their marketing is totally fake!!!"

"June 24, 2018",1,Incompetent delivery and company,"Initially I really liked this company. They had nice quality clothing and actually fit my tall husband.  However I‚Äôve had a lot of problems with them lately. They send me someone else‚Äôs packages twice. I could have kept the items but I took the time and trouble to return them to the company. They did nothing to thank me. Which I let go of initially. However, I placed an order for 2 day shipping, which I know 100% I selected. My husband saw me do it. I needed the dress for a wedding before I left on a trip. They then changed the shipping to 4 days but not only will it not arrive in 4 days it will arrive 10 days from now. I contact them to ask them to make the adjustment. They refuse to help me. I just spent $160 at their company and paid for shipping and they wouldn‚Äôt fix their mistake. What an incompetent joke of a company. I will never shop there again. They really should have given me a coupon for helping them out twice but instead they stole my shipping money and made sure my order wouldn‚Äôt arrive in time."

ASOS will not refund your money or help to locate your missing order.My order was worth over ¬£300, and i paid for ext day delivery.

"June 23, 2018",1,Spoke to a lady called Lateefah‚Ä¶,"Spoke to a lady called Lateefah on live chat regarding DPD turning up and not bothering to deliver my order (he parked directly outside, took a picture of the buildings opposite, then drove off and notified me that there was nobody in to take my parcel). She ignored my issue, claimed that nothing had gone wrong and implied it was my fault for not answering the door, despite me pointing out that the driver himself had taken a photo of the wrong address. When I asked her if a refund of my the postage costs was possible, she again ignored the issue and like a robot asked me if there was anything else she could help me with. So as I've paid through PayPal, I've raised a claim with them to get my postage back. I didn't pay ¬£6 to watch the delivery man, with my parcel in his van, directly outside my flat, take a picture of a completely different building, and then proceed to drive off without even leaving a calling card. A shame when ASOS gets its right everywhere else (price, quality, ease of ordering)... all let down by a chatbot (might as well have been) and a rubbish courier."

"June 23, 2018",1,Worst customer service I have ever had,"Worst customer service I have ever recieved. No parcel, no refund. Clueless, inconsistent, & incompetent. And to top it all off they are liars. Could not and would not resolve my problem.  I will never shop with them again."
"June 22, 2018",1,"Turn back now, empty your cart","Alright, so I‚Äôll start by saying that I‚Äôve ordered from ASOS before with no problem. However, this time has been an absolute nightmare and they‚Äôve lost my business forever. I ordered several items on the first of the month and was notified that they would be delivered by the 12th. The tracking showed the package‚Äôs arrival at JFK on the 6th- where it stayed for the next 6 days. When I called to inquire about this, I was told there had been a delay and my package would arrive on the 14th. Ok two weeks is past their promised 2-7 day shipping but I understand that international shipping is lengthy. When the customer service representative confirmed my address at the end of the chat, it was my old address in a different state instead of the new address I had entered and saved. Ok, technical difficulties are frustrating but understandable. The customer service rep offered to send a replacement to my correct address with express shipping, which was appreciated. He had me change my address in the system, which gave me an error code several times before allowing me to save it on my mobile device. He confirmed that he could see my correct address in my account TWICE. I received a confirmation email the next day and one of the items I had ordered was now out of stock. Frustrating, but again understandable. But any guesses what the shipping address was when I scrolled through that email? That‚Äôs right, they AGAIN shipped it to the wrong address. When I contacted customer service to express my frustration and see what they could do to resolve the issue, they told me that it could not be re-routed on their end and to contact UPS. If I could somehow return the packages delivered to the wrong address in a different state THEN they would refund me. Worst customer care. If you mess up twice and you customer still does not have the package in their possession you should automatically refund the card. So now I‚Äôve had to ask a friend to pick up and ship both packages to me, which was not cheap. And it‚Äôs been an absolute nightmare with UPS as anyone who has used them for shipping knows. Still don‚Äôt have my package that I ordered a full month ago now. I mean, please don‚Äôt shop with ASOS. The nightmarish pergatory you‚Äôll be stuck in is not worth it."

But this last week I have been having to chase them daily to find out where my order is. I placed my order on 14 June with delivery expected on 15 June and it didn't arrive so I chased them on 16 June. When I originally contacted them, they told me I'd have to wait 48 hours for a response and this time period elapsed with no contact from them. I've contacted them daily since and each day they issue a new timeline of 3-5 working days for when I should get a response from them with an update on my order.  And now, each day the 5th working day of their 3-5 working day timeline just keeps moving further and further back!!! I have repeatedly asked them just to cancel my order and refund me, but they refuse, stating this spurious, ever-extending timeline!! The irony is that I recently renewed my Premier delivery subscription to be able to get next day delivery and to add insult to injury, the items that I ordered I've been able to find alternatives elsewhere!!

I reached out to ASOS and they quickly replied that it would be here June 15(4 days after the original expected delivery). June 18 I decided to reach back out and ask for an update. They lost my package. I told the really unhelpful gentleman that this was for my rehearsal dinner and now that that has passed I am done dealing with their company and just would like a refund. Well he refused. He said they reported it to their ‚Äúshipment team‚Äù and they‚Äôll be in touch. So I got online to try to call someone to get different help. You can‚Äôt. You can only chat with someone who will copy and paste the same response over and over again. I spent $200 on this order and much more before that. I will never purchase from ASOS again.

After bringing it up to ASOS, they offered a compete refund without the need to return the shoes, and were very helpful and attentive to the situation.

It was sent quite quickly and was out for delivery on the 14th, cool I thought, my local Hermes will just deliver it through the letterbox and this will be the end of this story. But no.. Hermes couldn't deliver my parcel and I look on the tracking number, where it says they will try again in 24 hours, great I thought, I will be home then. Bear in mind that I haven't received any emails at all from Hermes.. so come Friday or Saturday,  I check my tracking number and it now says 'return to sender' I am like what the heck, this never had happened, I have over 20 orders ALL MADE TO THAT ADDRESS!!! I contact asos, and this is where I am met by a wall of rudeness, they said that it's Hermes fault and that I should contact them, then I did that, and Hermes says it's asos as a retailer that should contact them to stop the return?.... Rude employees at asos tells me to just make a reorder, thanks alot - But the item is sold out, which means that they didn't even bother to look at that (they tell me they don't know when it will be in stock... I didn't ask for that!!)? I worked in customer service for a big online company, I know what good customer service is, I definitely didn't receive that here... They won't even give me a compensation for my time and inconvenience. All I wanted is a we are sorry for this, I can definitely see that there has been a mistake here...

For the prices they sell, we can't expect a 5 star customer service but they come close enough from it.I would recommend."

I was very stressed, and told them I do not like owing money when I don‚Äôt and wanted some sort of confirmation.I ended up making a complaint, I spoke with Dominic over Webchat. He told me he had resolved my issue by telling me to go to Klarna and tell them myself, of which I told him surely they could not take me just on my word and he provided an answer of maybe.I actually had to ask for an apology for their admin error, as prior to that all he had said was ‚Äòsorry for your inconvenience‚Äô.When I asked who he was governed by he would not answer, saying he was able to resolve the issue.

"June 15, 2018",1,very Poor customer service,Slow and robotic responses I‚Äôm guessing they have been trained to respond that way - never follow through promptly on refunds - recently hurt my ankle on a pair of shoes I only wore once - clearly a quality and control issue and they are still investigating after I sent the shoes back ages ago. Needed to visit my doctor for anti inflammatory medication as the shoe completely snapped and I was as left injured in town centre and embarrassed - seeking legal advice - Don‚Äôt seem to care about stress or inconvenience.
"June 15, 2018",1,Just awful 'customer service'.,"Just awful 'customer service'.Desperate for clothes for holiday I paid extra for evening delivery the following night. Waited in all night..it didn't arrive. Turned out asos hadn't processed it. No applogie from the robot  I contacted, just told me I had to redo the whole order of 30 items manually!Re-placed order and waited in last night, at 11pm finally gave up. Contacted asos again.. really rude and unhelpful. God knows where my order is!Will not be shopping with asos again!!!"
"June 15, 2018",1,Appalling company and customer service.,"Order was returned and confirmed via Collect Plus tracking that it was received by ASOS 2 days ago. When I contact customer service to see when my refund would be processed, I was told they haven't received it and wait another 11 days, even though I confirmed it shows the journey online and that it was received. Was also told I cannot make a complaint as customer services deal with everything. Quick enough to take your money but wont return. Appalling."
"June 14, 2018",1,Poor shipping,"I have to leave a one star purely due to the terrible postage times and lack of customer service regarding the postage. I live in Australia and years ago Asos used to have super fast shipping over here. I would receive my package within days. They have now been using TERRIBLE courier services in Australia to deliver their products. I have contacted the Asos customer service multiple times to tell them how bad their partner courier companies here are and they did not care one bit. It wasnt even a 'oh we will take that into consideration'. It was just a 'too bad deal with it'. I even stopped using Asos due to this fact about a year ago, but about 2 weeks ago I decided I would give them another go to see if hopefully they had chosen a better courier partner, however nothing has changed. I've been waiting 2 weeks for my package,  the Australian Courier company (Couriers Please) have had my package for 7 days and they have not once attempted to deliver. I am awaiting a response from their customer service... Its also the fact that Asos try to tell you that you will have your item in a few days.. its been 2 weeks. Its false advertising."
"June 14, 2018",1,Rude Customer service & refuse full refund,Ripped of when not given full refund and customer service end the chat when they do not want to deal with you. Avoid as much as you can all they want is your money
"June 14, 2018",2,Don‚Äôt get shoes that are smaller than size 3!,"I got these partyline wide fit platform heels in a size 2 and I was so ecstatic because no shop ever sells size 2 heels for women. The delivery was fine and the quality is good however, they are not a size 2 but more like a 3! There is so much gap in the heel that I can‚Äôt get away with putting anything there to close the gap. The same thing had happened with a pair of sandals however I can get away with them as they aren‚Äôt heeled. I don‚Äôt know whether ASOS don‚Äôt know their sizing or whether they just put size 2 but actually make sizes 3 but they are definitely not size 2. If you have small feet under size 3 don‚Äôt get shoes from here!!!!"

You pay for a Premium Next Day Delivery Service, and 4 days later still no delivery, no communication from ASOS and no response to comms from the customer.  Yet they are still sitting on my ¬£265 while they try to understand the issue with their ""Specialist Team""Someone give them a sharp less in Customer Service and Communication Skills!Worst on-line retailer ever ........."

When I haven't received it yet on the 20 May I wrote to them, and they promised to look in to it.I have since written to them like a dozen times, because they never went back to me.. They always make the same excuses, that they are looking in to it and I will have to wait 48h until they will have an answer. That is now a month a go they started to promise me this.. And i still haven't received neither my order or my money back.. They doesn't want to help me. And closed my online chat while I was chatting with them, just because they didn't know what to answer me.. I will never shop on this site again.."
"June 12, 2018",1,Insult to injury... shocking!,"I cannot even begin to explain the disgusting level of ""Customer Service"". Repeated robotic emails with no sincere apologies or assistance! I received my parcel on the 31st May, returned back on the 1st June. The 4th June it was delivered back to them. On the 11th June, I contacted them for an update on my refund... as I know it can take up to 7 working days to process this. I received an email ""apologising"" for the delay, stating that the parcel had been received and I should have a refund actioned by the 12th (today). Then, I get another email saying they haven't got my parcel ü§î and to contact them today if I'd not heard anything. Still not heard anything, contacted them to then be informed that I have to wait until the 19th?! How is it acceptable to allow a customer to wait 18 days after a parcel was sent and 15 days for a refund to be processed after it has been received? Then to add to the insult that 3-5 working days for the funds to show as available!! I know they will not be bothered by this review, as you can tell by all the others. They should respect their customers and help them! That's all we ask"
"June 12, 2018",2,I tried but...,Honestly I‚Äôve tried to buy things that I adore from ASOS several times and each time I‚Äôve received horrible quality items. Sizing is fine but the materials are just yucky. Not comfortable at all and not very flattering.
"June 12, 2018",1,Atrocious customer service and worst I‚Äôve ever experienced,"Ordered some dresses 9th April 2018, parcel turns up damaged (with DPD tape all over it) and 2 items missing.  Tell ASOS and it‚Äôs now 12th June and still no refund for the missing items.  I‚Äôve e:mails lots, used live chat, messenger etc.. and all I get is ‚Äúlet me apologise for the delay in resolving your query‚Äù.  I lodged 2 separate complaints without getting any formal acknowledge or progress update except them saying ‚Äúwe are looking into this‚Äù.  It‚Äôs quite honestly the worse and the slowest customer service I‚Äôve ever received.  Appreciate they have processes to follow for missing items but to take over 2 months to sort something so basic is atrocious."
"June 12, 2018",4,Alot to choose from,Alot to choose from. Always quick to deliver and no problem with returns
"June 12, 2018",1,Mistakes and bad service,"I have ordered dresses on Sunday. As this is quite urgent, I requested a next day delivery. They did delivered the next day, but as I am working, I wasn't there, and as this is delivered with DPD, I couldn't pick the parcel up at the post office. So I organised to have a delivery to a local shop today. Then, I received a SMS saying that ""as requested"", the delivery will be on the 13th, which is tomorrow, when I never requested this. So I have paid for a next day delivery, but will receive it (maybe) tomorrow, so 3 days after. I have contacted the customer service which couldn't help me because I have ordered through my boyfriend's email address. Really unhappy, should have checked Trustpilot before ordering anything. Won't do it again."
"June 12, 2018",1,Worst online retailer,"Worst online retailer. My last order never arrived through a mistake by them, not the courier. They never sent the package in the first place. This is the second time this has happened to me and the last time it took 6 weeks for them to finally resolve it and just resent my items. Worst customer service. If you have any issues good luck trying to get help, it is virtually impossible"

"June 11, 2018",1,Do not shop at ASOS,Do not shop at ASOS. The company is not U.S. based and they do not offer immediate customer service. I placed an order online May 31 and my delivery was scheduled for June 8th. Upon getting my package every item I ordered was incorrect. I searched the website hoping to find a customer service number but they did not have one only could be contacted via email. After several hours and days of delay communicating via email they informed me that all the items that I had ordered were no longer in stock and they could not fulfill my order. Highly upset because at the time the items were there and had my order been fulfilled correctly I would have received my items. I am an avid online shopper and have never experienced such unprofessionalism. So long story short DO NOT ORDER FROM ASOS.
"June 11, 2018",1,Worst customer service ever!,"Worst customer service ever!I am a customer for 7 years, but i had so many issues with 1 order, and still not resolved. Asos made mistake for 5 times with 1 order. All the time something missing from the order, then ages to wait for reply. Never received reply on complain emails, people who is responding on live chats, are useless and rude. Horrible customer service .Nothing can be resolved if anything about deliver / refund . The worst thing is that it need to be chased everyday. When i asked for compensation or anything to make my experience better, i have been told that this option is not available. Frustration."
"June 11, 2018",1,Absolutely shocking service,Absolutely shocking service! Be aware when returning items mine got lost and I have not received a refund!!
"June 11, 2018",1,Bad customer service experience,"I contacted them for my student coupon code issue but the customer care rep (Chloe) did not help me at all. Even after I showed my student ID and my fall 2018 classes schedule then she said they can not approve it because there is no enough formal document infor that showing my graduation year. I never heard this before with any other companies in order to get my student benefits. With other companies u just have to proof u r an active student then good enough but I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with ASOS. I‚Äôm Very upset and I‚Äôm not sure should I keep shopping with them, I lost my confident with this company."
"June 10, 2018",1,slow clap for ASOS!!,I ordered these shoes from ASOS: RAID Helena Grey Multi Buckle Grunge Flat Ankle Boots - Grey / UK 6 and within 4 months they had split nearly all the way accross the sole on the left shoe and starting to show the same damage on the right. Holes have appeared at the seams and where the fabric joins the sole - for the amount of money I paid for them this is unacceptable. This wouldnt have been so bad as it is reasonable to expect that this will happen from time to time but coupled with a customer service who responded to my varied and detailed questions with 'i do not have this information at hand' or 'this is decided else where' and repeats there of really gave a real sense of a distinct lack of caring ASOS has for their customers. Big slow clap for ASOS!! If customer reviews were allowed on their website I would post a lot of images of shocking quality shoes falling apart after only around 12 weeks of wear so I can see why they don't have that facility!! Very poor quality items and astoundingly dissapointing customer care!
"June 10, 2018",5,Frequent user of ASOS,"Frequent user of ASOS, deliveries are on time and returns are no hassle. On the rare occasion where a return has not reached the warehouse, I have emailed the customer service team who handle it very promptly and issue a refund provided you have proof of postage.

"June 09, 2018",1,"Awful sizing, awful customer service, avoid!","I am a petite girl and was thrilled to find a Petite section on Asos' website. Using the measurements of each item on the site, I put in an order I was very excited about, because by the measurements the clothing would fit perfectly! Needless to say, every single article of clothing was a completely different size than what was advertised on the site.I had to pay all of the shipping costs to return the items to them, and still 3 months later, I hadn't heard anything from the company. I tried to contact them to see about my return and refund, and they said they couldn't do anything about it and their customer service was very bland, unhelpful, and it seemed like the agent was basically copying and pasting paragraphs from a manual.Looking back, I definitely wish I didn't order with them, because a huge warning sign was that they don't allow customer reviews on their website. If they did allow reviews, I would have seen all of the awful things people are saying here, and steered clear of this terrible company. NEVER AGAIN, AVOID AT ALL COST!"

"June 09, 2018",1,ASOS customer services is REALLY BAD,"Their customer service is appalling. After placing an order (with premium delivery ¬£9.99) I received an email from Asos 3 days later stating that they made a mistake with the delivery address and the item was send back to them.This is what they wrote to me:'I'm getting in touch to let you know your parcel has been shipped with an incorrect address label on it and is now being returned to us - I'm really sorry about this.I've arranged for a replacement of your order to be sent to you (subject to stock availability). Don't worry - as you've already been charged for your order you won't be charged again and the replacement delivery service is free. We'll be in touch within the next 4 days  with an update about your replacement.In the meantime, if you have any other questions, please do let me know - I'd be happy to help. First of all why do you need a replacement. If it was returned to Asos just re-send it. Secondly it's been 10 days and still they have not updated me and although I've send them a couple of emails asking for updates they have never replied to me - NOT SO HAPPY TO HELP. Also I laughed with their reassurance that I would not have to pay extra shipping costs...I am currently on a live chat with them. Still no answers.ooooh got a refund! Well done Asos! Now they are telling me that I received the wrong item (never received anything) and when I asked for an exchange they didn't have the original item I requested. So my fault or the carrier's or the weather's....The live chat is now over. James from customer service just ended the chat. So that's it. Although it was their mistake, they now have turned it around to it being my fault, and that basically since they refunded the money I should be happy."

Been emailing them, asking them where my goods have gone as monies have left my account. In the meantime, the item has now gone back up in price and seems they don't want to honour the transaction. They claim my order 'just hasn't been sent' and they do not know why but we will order a replacement -Subject to availability, which no one has come back to me on....The item is now 'Out of stock' as its been so long.All in all, after my many emails and telephone calls to chase this missing order, it was a complete waste of time! A big failure of ASOS' part.I shop online all the time and have never experience such stressful and disappointingly bad shopping experience. Certainly won't be shopping with them again or believe any of their sale prices the next time it pop up on my online ads. Shop elsewhere for a stress-free experience, where you do actually get something at the end of it!"
"June 08, 2018",1,Paid over 100 for a worn and stained dress,"The over 100 Euro dress I bought for an event came stained. It looks like someone ordered it, worn it and then returned it and Asos is just selling it further at full price. Unacceptable."
"June 08, 2018",5,ASOS,I've been shopping with ASOS for over ten years and it's always been a stress free experience. The shipping and returns are easy and free - who can be bothered trying things on in stuffy changing rooms any more?

Instead of getting bikini bottom and a top I got two bottoms. I immediately contacted them through this chat and she told me they would try to find a new one the next 24hrs. On Thursday I got an email saying they didn‚Äôt have it and refunded me. Next day (on friday) I got an email saying the bikini top was on its way! Great costumer service. I‚Äôve been purchasing on asos for awhile now and I love it. Would recommend 10/10"

They rip you off on returns!!! They reduced my credit by the ENTIRE promo code i had used for my purchase. Basically I should have kept the items because they gave me almost nothing for refund. They should have prorated the promo code discount to all my items but instead they reduced my returns by the ENTIRE promo code. SCAM!!!! And I kept more than half of my order. I WOULD NEVER BUY FROM THIS SITE AGAIN. Can't talk to anyone either, only chat. They won't let you chat with a supervisor either. they have well-trained staff to give you NO Customer Service!"

Still trying to squeeze a replacement out of them 2 weeks after a DPD driver was witnessed returning to his van with my parcel and driving off, leaving me with a missing delivery. Because he claims to have left it in the garden they have dragged it out for as long as possible 'chasing with DPD' (the amount of times I've been told to wait another 3-5 days is laughable). They're only interested in getting their claim from DPD and don't care that I have paid money and have nothing to show for it. They copy and paste answers too which is the most patronising way to be treated as a customer. I was a loyal customer ordering  regularly but will be cancelling my premier account ASAP and going elsewhere. I work in customer service myself and can safely say if I provided this poor level of service to one of my customers, I would be disciplined by my manager! Stay away!"

So the money was paid via Paypal , but there is no order on the site. I've contacted seller, but he told me to contact asos. I've contacted seller again via Paypal, but no answer. Then I've contacted asos by their contact email, but no answer! I'm very very unhappy about that. On asos site I even can't find messages sent to the seller! I don't trust asos anymore. It is too much problems with the purchase via this site. Not going to use asos ever in my life again."

I got asos to re arrange the delivery and they promised it would arrive the same day as a rescheduled delivery before 10pm. Didn't happen....Checked with the useless company ukmail to see where it was, it's still at the bloody depot!I paid ¬£6 extra for next day delivery but I didn't receive it next day. Im absolutely furious and feel robbed."
"June 05, 2018",1,Absolutely awful customer service,"Absolutely awful customer service. Ordered a dress and needed to exchange for a smaller size. They said absolutely fine for a free exchange. Then they refunded the money. I could not repurchase the dress as it had gone up in price. I was on chat for and hour and 15 minutes and they would not let me exchange/re order the dress for the same price. What a waste of my time. Tried to offer me discount codes that did not even match the original price I paid, then suggested I re purchase full price and then contact for a refund, I don't trust them now so wouldn't do this. Online chat is the only help available and they don't care. They hope if they waste your time for long enough you will go away which is what I had to do in the end."
"June 05, 2018",1,Fastways and ASOS both awful,"I placed my order 3 weeks ago. The order was dispatched and got as far as Ireland, but Fastways never delivered or contacted me. I got onto them and they said that the order was gone back to ASOS. ASOS emailed me then to say my order was being sent this time by UPS who did call me and delivered quickly but without the majority of the items. So all in all terrible."
"June 05, 2018",5,They‚Äôve Got your Back!,Nobody‚Äôs perfect but what I appreciate from ASOS is even if they have made a mistake they would admit it and apologize. I have been buying off ASOS for years and I have been always in constant contact with their customer service. Some days they take forever to respond while others in an instant. But you should know that that no matter what they will always respond to your mail. I have complete trust in their products and service. They literally make my life easier and that‚Äôs why ASOS is my go-to!

"June 04, 2018",1,Still waiting for my refund‚Ä¶,Used to be very good at customer care but it seems they have gone downhill. Returned an item over 5 weeks ago now but they seem unable to refund me due to technical issues. Fed up of this dragging on. It seems from other reviews that this is now a norm for ASOS.
"June 04, 2018",1,Stay away,Guys do not buy from ASOS. Purchased a watch and it had a defect which prevented it from clicking and it always fell. took it to a horologist and he told me it was a defective product. The price to repair the watch would be greater than the cost of the watch itself.I also bought sunglasses but it was not UV resistant as it mentioned. While driving the sunlight hit through the sunglasses and made it extremely difficult to focus on the road. At one point I could not see my speedometer due to the knockoff product they sold. They falsely advertise and do not give crucial information about products. First and last time I purchased there.
"June 04, 2018",4,Happy overall,"Fast shipping, cute clothes and free returns. Have been shopping here for 4 years now and only thing I wish could improve is the quality of some of the merchandise, but for something quick and easy for the season, this is the place to find something!"

"June 03, 2018",3,Long story..,"Long story..I spent about ¬£120 in the sale, just to update the basics in my wardrobe and add a little colour ready for the summer.I asked for the delivery address to be the same as the billing address. But when I got a notification that it was delivered, I hadn't heard a knock on the door or had a delivery slip come through so I was really confused.I went on the website and ended up talking to a customer service representative through their instant chat. She informed me that it had been sent to a different city, to an address I didn't recognise, because that's my default delivery address.. I found it very strange, she offered to send me a replacement order. She made sure I had deleted the unknown address from my address book before she sent the replacement.Shortly after that conversation, I realised I had a friend in the city it was sent to, and reached out to see if she knew the address. It really is a small world, because she did, and she was willing to contact the guy she knew to get my parcel back. I didn't want to be committing fraud by reporting a parcel as undelivered, getting a replacement and getting the original. So I got in touch again using instant chat. I explained to the new customer advisor that I had spoken to one of his colleagues and I just needed him to cancel the replacement order as I could get it back myself. He thanked me, and did as I asked.Once I got the order, I noticed there were items missing. 6 in total, which amounted to around ¬£40. I didn't have a delivery note so I felt like there was nothing I could do. To be sure, once again I used the chat feature to talk to customer services. They apologised and asked for a list of the missing items. They offered me replacements where possible and a refund for those out of stock.Where do we think this replacement order was sent?! Yup, the same place as the first one!I got in touch again, making sure they knew this was ridiculous. I spoke with Daniel who took AGES to respond to me. He made very little apology, considering this is their mistake. He suggested that I make arrangements to get it myself. I don't really know how he expected me to do that since my friend was on holiday, but he didn't have any other suggestions. 11 minutes to have a conversation that should have taken 3 at most. Brilliant..I made it very clear that I would never shop with them again. How can you send my parcel to an address not in my address book, and then expect me to clean up the mess..?!"
"June 03, 2018",1,Absolutely horrible,"Absolutely horrible. The sent me the completely wrong dress and wrong size. When I spoke with customer service about it, they were disgusting, and said that processing takes 4 days. And that I wouldn‚Äôt receive my dress for another 8 days... I needed the dress this week and I asked them to give me some sort of refund for all this. They said they couldn‚Äôt give me any refund if I was asking them to send me the replacement. I will never buy from them again. Horrible horrible company!!!"

They send me wrong dress but tag says the name of dress i ordered, wrong size too. i call they tell me replacement takes 4 days i call to verify next day,  now they are telling me 8 days. i paid for expedited shipping to have this dress for a wedding. They could careless. I wish I would of read the reviews bc i would NEVER have ordered from such a shady unprofessional company."

"June 02, 2018",1,I returned boots I ordered from asos 3‚Ä¶,"I returned boots I ordered from asos 3 months ago, they sent me the wrong boots and I returned them. They send me another pair the same ones but a different size. No where did I ask for a different size I simply asked for a refund but they have poor customer service I will never buy from asos again."
"June 01, 2018",1,Rude and condescending,"I ordered a dress form ASOS and the estimated arrival date was one week later. Good, looking forward to my dress. Two weeks later still no dress, I speak to the helpline provided by ASOS, the lady I was speaking to was rude and no help as to why I had not received my dress and told just to wait and to close this conversation."
"June 01, 2018",1,Placed an order on 22nd may,"Placed an order on 22nd may, estimated delivery date 30th may. No news on 30th, i write to them, they tell me i need to wait until 10 pm. No news on 31st, i write to them, they tell me they‚Äôre sending my case to customer care, who will get in touch with me, no news. Today, 1st june, i receive an email my order was dispatched, but none of the links work, i write to them again. They tell me my order was canceled, by me, i ask them for a proof my order was canceled by me, they just closed the chat. I have no idea when did asos become such a bad and unreliable seller, they were so much better in terms of deliveries and customer service."
"June 01, 2018",1,THICK,"Ordered some boots nearly two weeks ago (slowest delivery ever) and just when they‚Äôre due to be delivered today, they‚Äôre now on their way back to the warehouse for some strange reason?!.. boots are now out of stock in my size and now I don‚Äôt get my money back straight away. Joke of a company with the slowest delivery times and now I have no new boots to wear this weekend because ASOS are stupid!!!!"
"May 31, 2018",1,Refunds are terrible,Refunds are terrible - if you order with a discount you will not get a pro rata refund when you return an item. Had ¬£20 off order of ¬£137 pounds (so spent ¬£117). When returned ¬£25 trousers only got a refund of ¬£5. If we had known that we could have sold them for more than ¬£5.

"May 31, 2018",1,Terrible service!,Never experienced such dreadful service. Ordered an item for a wedding Was told it had trouble leaving the warehouse and they were going to send it out again. Still waiting 2 weeks later. Even next day delivery takes 5 days apprantly!
"May 30, 2018",5,Great Experience Shopping Online,"Great experience shopping with Asos.Great customer support, on-time delivery of the product (outside UK) and huge selection of styles with okay prices.I love their marketing content as well."
"May 30, 2018",5,My go to company for clothes,"I place orders with ASOS frequently and have done so from many different countries (UK, Sweden & Canada) and has never had a problem. UK offers next day delivery which is great but even abroad the delivery time is good. Never have an issue with returns or exchanges and refunds are processed quickly. They now offer KLARNA which I love because if you are ordering multiple sizes or not sure about an item you don't have to wait for a refund, just simply pay the bill when you know what you're keeping and what is going back."
"May 30, 2018",5,in time and smooth return,Ordered from sweden and the order was delivered earlier than specified. Kept one dress but returned the other. The return went very smooth. No costs and got an email when the return had been received. I really recommend Asos!
"May 30, 2018",5,Fantastic service,"Great company, fab clothes, returns couldn‚Äôt be easier and very fast delivery. What‚Äôs not to like? Well done ASOS üëåüèº"
"May 30, 2018",2,Bad costumer service,"I like asos as a clothing store, but i hate costumers service. I just had a chat with them, and because THEY send an wrong item, that I did NOT order, they want me to send it back, so they can send me the right item.. but the problem is I actually like the wrong item, and I wanna keep it, but they want me to send it back anyways. Like why?? I wanna keep it. Why make it such a big deal. All I wanted was for them to reconize that they made a mistake and maybe give a discount because of THEIR mistake, so I can get the one I actually ordered. Like. I was willing to REORDER, and pay again, but no, they want the wrong item back even tho I like it. That‚Äôs not costumer service."
"May 30, 2018",2,Awful customer service,"Awful customer service. Unwilling to help or accept responsibility for their faults. Clothes don‚Äôt look as they do on the net, sizing of the SAME style varies drastically. Not shopping there again and don‚Äôt recommend."
"May 30, 2018",1,Order not received after 9 days and bad customer service.,"I've ordered on Asos on the 21st of May and 9 days later, I don't have my order yet. The courrier (Hermes) pretented they tried to deliver it yesterday and today but it's not true. I was at home all day, yesterday and today.Asos customer service is useless as they keep saying that according to the tracking website, delivery attempts were made. They don't want to contact the courrier to fix the issue and they told me to wait for a refund if I don't get my order‚Ä¶ They are not professional and they don't care about customers."
"May 30, 2018",2,good but use bad companys,like using asos but cant rate any higher as they use hermes as a courier

Their sizes are vastly off, and most of the items are either cheaply made, or appear very different to their pictures. I will not be ordering from ASOS again."
"May 30, 2018",5,i love ASOS ‚Ä¶ sorry some people don‚Äôt,"My friend brought me to their VIP event last year. Before using them I hadn‚Äôt ever shopped. I‚Äôm so happy with my service. Face and Body is amazing - had some great buys I love the discounts and the extra points to make things cheaper. I don‚Äôt exchange. I will buy either two sizes and return one. Or buy it in the size I think, if it‚Äôs wrong order another and send back the wrong size I‚Äôve never had any problems with returns. I rave about ASOS, one stop shop for essentials. I hope to be at your next event please !!! I‚Äôve spent so much with you now üòÇ"
"May 29, 2018",5,Great Experience,"I recently ordered $50 worth of swimwear from asos. Unfortunately, neither the top nor bottom fit well so I ended up returning both of them. The quality was the same as you'd get from Target or any other cheaper-priced swimwear store. I received the items within 3 days of ordering, even though I only did standard shipping. I was pretty nervous to return the items because of previous bad reviews, so I ended up taking screenshots of all of my order and delivery information and kept a close eye on the tracking. However, I didn't need to do any of that (but I'm still glad I did just incase) because the return was completely smooth. They had a free return slip through USPS, tracking is free, they contacted me the day the tracking said they got it and confirmed that they did, and I received my full refund within a few days. Perhaps I got lucky, or they changed up how they do the returns since the other bad reviews, but I had a great experience with them even though the clothes didn't work out."
"May 29, 2018",4,Great selection of almost everything,"Great selection of almost everything, love the option of buy now pay later with Klarna which means you can order things, try them on and only pay for what you keep. The only slight downside is that while it says ‚Äúwith you on or before xxx‚Äù it usually comes later than advertised. But as I‚Äôm not one to buy things in a rush it‚Äôs ok but it might bother there who need a last minute outfit so be aware it might not arrive on the day they say. But overall I will happily order again"
"May 29, 2018",3,Used to give this 5 stars but‚Ä¶,"Used to give this 5 stars but as a regular customer in recent weeks I have seen the service decline and having experienced their customer service for the first time on these occasions I find them arrogant and unwilling to help.I pay for Next Day Delivery, therefore I expect next day, and 3 out of the last four deliveries have been 5-6 days before arrival. No one at DPD or ASOS seems inclined to assist and I just have to wait, while being reminded how happy ASOS is of their own.A final point, stock seems to be an issue. So many items out of stock."
"May 29, 2018",5,Great clothes and shoes in small sizes,Great clothes and shoes in small sizes! Delivering is very fast and did not have any problems with it so far! Mostly it is for free when you spend a certain amount.
"May 28, 2018",1,Not worth it,"Not worth it, if you are shipping internationally don't waste your time with ASOS. Shop at mango or something. They have free shipping and returns and amazing customer service. Every time I shop at Asos I regret it. My total came to $380 and I paid $140 for duty only and $15 for Express delivery. I paid extra for delivery and it still takes longer than when I place orders with Mango, which ships it right away. I literally get my order in 3-5 days with Mango. But with Asos I haven't even seen the clothes yet, and I just hope they look and fit well because I can't even return them since it won't be worth it."
"May 28, 2018",1,Not worth the hassle,"No joke, 3 of my last 4 orders have been incorrect. One was the wrong jeans completely, the second was a jacket in the wrong colour. However, today was a new low, not only were the jeans completely wrong, but they have a huge tear in the crotch and clearly look like someone has worn them a few times and returned them. 9 hours later, I am yet to hear back from ASOS apart from the auto generated nonsense. Will never ever use again"
"May 27, 2018",5,Couldn't fault it.,"Always had excellent service for delivery, returns, any issues etc. A good, reliable website."

"May 26, 2018",1,This time around I have had a VERY BAD‚Ä¶,"This time around I have had a VERY BAD experience with Asos. I returned some items and they have confirmed that they have received these but haven't refunded me my ¬£96! It has been nearly 3 weeks! I've contacted them via telephone and email (each time having to repeat the same details). They asked for a statement and I sent them a csv file from my online account (I can only download in csv from their website). I explained this to Asos and to show authenticity, I also sent screenshots but to my dismay, they have said that this is unacceptable. Furthermore, they were unable to open the csv file but had the audacity to patronise me and say that if I don't have the capability to send a pdf then I should ask a friend or family for help. I'm a computer scientist! They want me to print off the statement and send in photographs of this print out instead! Doesn't make any sense to me why they can't accept the screen shot! I've been quite stressed because we're not just talking about a couple of pounds and I have bills to pay! It has definitely made me think twice about shopping with Asos ever again!"
"May 26, 2018",1,Patronising customer service who refuse‚Ä¶,"Patronising customer service who refuse to accept that they could have made any mistake, such a shame as the clothes are great but I have NEVER had an order from these clowns without problems or delays."

"May 26, 2018",1,Highly unacceptable customer service I‚Ä¶,"Highly unacceptable customer service I faced today. I ordered a package on May 22nd paid for 2 day shipping , received an estimated delivery date of May 25th.Learned today that ASOS did not prepare the shipment until yesterday. And requested not a Saturday delivery. I am scheduled to go out of the country on Sunday without 3 items I purchased that was supposed to be delivered today."
"May 25, 2018",5,Never had a problem,"Among a huge number of online stores with non-refundable items poorly made and shipped from China, Asos is NOT one of them. I have been buying from them for several years now, and yes, not all sizes fit me, but it had never been a problem, because the refunds are super fast, the fabric is exactly as described, and to this day I get compliments on several Asos dresses. They are unique and have tons of options."
"May 25, 2018",1,Zero star customer service,"Zero star customer service .  Again, horrible customer service . Nothing can be resolved if anything about deliver / refund . i have been waiting for my refund over 1 month. still nothing .. need to chase any day. what's the point to buy from them again"
"May 25, 2018",1,rubbish customer service,"exactly the same as the review below from mehran - used the ¬£30 discount for an order worth around ¬£150, when i returned some of the products they took the ¬£50 discount off me. so a returns which should have been ¬£56 was instead ¬£26. one of the items i returned cost ¬£22 in itself so they completely cheated me out of money. i asked to rework the original order to use another discount code, or to just get a different size for the items i returned so i didn't lose that money, and i was point blank refused by daniel and che who did not provide good customer support at all. i couldn't believe they would rather lose a loyal customer then just give me the ¬£30 back"
"May 25, 2018",5,Really good service,Really good service. They completely refunded me orders which had been sent to the wrong place (my fault)
"May 24, 2018",1,It's great until things go wrong,"It's great until things go wrong, the customer service is shocking. If you use discounts on purchases and have to send them back just be aware you loose the full discount even if you only send one item back."
"May 24, 2018",1,ASOS asks for TOO MUCH!,"Never ordering from them again. I returned one pair of jeans and they refunded me for the wrong pair and because of that, the refund was much less than they owe me. They claimed to have updated the refund and it should show up in my bank statement in X business days. After 3 weeks, I still didn't see this refund.I contacted ASOS and told them and they asked me to wait another week, totaling a whole month. Again, nothing. I contacted ASOS once more and they asked for a credit card statement PDF because a screenshot isn't enough. Okay, that's weird but fine. I send them a single page PDF with a duration of 2 weeks where the refund never came. ""No, it has to be a full statement"". I sent them a full statement with my personal info and non-related transactions crossed out. ""No, you can't block out content from the statement"". Sure, let me give all this personal information to a bunch of strangers in a foreign country because that's what most people would do right? Wrong. After going back and forth for *3 MONTHS* over this stupid non-sense, I told them I'm filing a chargeback on my credit card and that  was EXACTLY what I did. Got my money back. My biggest mistake was not filling for the chargeback earlier. Also, every time I sent the an email, a different rep would respond and the rep would have no freaking idea what my issue is or what they're talking about."
"May 24, 2018",5,:))),"I have had no problems with them.  I had three orders, which I returned all three orders.  I am looking to a specific dress, which is the reason for all my returns.  The quality is great.  Shipping and returns are free, which is awesome.  They processed all my orders fast and got them in a reasonable time, along with my returns!  They do not do exchanges, so as I was reading some reviews, if you want to exchange, just return the item and re order it, because shipping and returns are free you might at well!  All three orders I have had a great easy time."
"May 23, 2018",1,Terrible costumor service..not willing‚Ä¶,"31-7-2018 still waiting for my money..its been more than 10 weeks!!! They dont peply to anything anymore...I started a fb group for onther victims"" ASOS gedeputeerden"" join if you want..maybe together we stand strong Terrible costumor service..not willing to help at all with order issues they created....and dont reply to emails. Very frustrating! Would rather take my money elsewere.....were i am apriciated as a costumor ( who spends thousands of $ a year)"
"May 23, 2018",3,the products turned out really good and‚Ä¶,the products turned out really good and according to my expectations; the delivery time wasn't that fast though. recommended to all my folks out there!
"May 23, 2018",2,Pay on your own for your more expensive returns if you care about your money,"The clothes I orderd are mostly ok. The wedding dress is nice except it is more yellowish than it should be. The same dress is more white on the video, of course. The other items were completely fine.I ordered two wedding dresses and returned the size that didn't fit. The price was 200 GBP. I followed the instructions for the return, and after 40 days it seems that my dress didn't arrive in their warehouse. Why? Somebody stole it because it was untracked item. This issue is common but they don't want to inform you about it because people don't want to pay for returns, and it's complicated, and they wouldn't buy many items. It's of psychological nature. So, I lost 200 GPB because I didn't know that I should've payed for sending it back to them. It would cost me 10-20 GBP, but I wouldn't lose 200. If I were smarter, I would do it, but I trusted the system. Foolish."
"May 23, 2018",4,Always use,"Although my delivery was a few days late (after paying for next day delivery), I have never had any issues.Delivery is usually quick and also so are processing refunds"
"May 22, 2018",1,"Horrible customer service, BEWARE!",ASOS randomly charged my card for over $100 and has no clear form of communication. I‚Äôve been trying to sort out the issue for months and have not yet to resolve it because of their poor communication. Very unprofessional and sad. I will never purchase anything from them again. Beware.
"May 22, 2018",1,Avoid this company like the plague,Avoid this company like the plague! I‚Äôve had a similar experience as a few on here where I‚Äôm been told to send bank statements to assist with non receipt of a refund and won‚Äôt help me until I send a PDF through. I politely advised that data protection exists and also that they should be the ones doing the leg work not me ! I will be reporting them. Oh and their advisors are obnoxious and ignorant so don‚Äôt bother phoning when you have an issue...you‚Äôre  better off with the robotic response. I‚Äôve never been as angry following a phone call as I was when I spoke to an advisor...they guy thought it was amusing to pretend he couldn‚Äôt hear me. I don‚Äôt think my ten year old would behave like this.
"May 22, 2018",1,Terrible,"Weird fitting clothes, terrible customer service and horrendous returns methods.When I asked for assistance as to why my returns had not been collected they offered little to no help. They said that they could not see the collection from the chosen company and that was where their assistance ended. Rubbish customer service and I will not be ordering from here again due to the returns methods and often over priced clothing."
"May 22, 2018",1,Do not buy from ASOS,Do not buy from ASOS! They claimed the shirt I ordered was due to be delivered no later than the Friday which was fine as I didn‚Äôt need the shirt till Saturday afternoon. However the shirt didn‚Äôt arrive until Saturday evening! I complained twice enough their online chat and both times they weren‚Äôt helpful at all and didn‚Äôt help me whatsoever. All they offered me was to refund my delivery of a mere ¬£3! Despite the short being now useless as the lies about the delivery date! After returning the shirt it took more than a week for the money to be returned in my account! Poor reliability and poor customer service! Do not use ASOS.
"May 21, 2018",1,Bad customer services,"Bad customer services, returned a faulty pair of shoes which stopped tracking on the 5th day after I shipped it, I contacted the company to be told I have to wait until 10 days have passed until they will look into further, then I was told I have to wait 10 WORKING days until they will look into it. I emailed the CEO and had a reply off customer services who was no help what so ever and didnt address all the issues I raised with the live help member of staff who closed the chat on me and refused to pass me through to a supervisor. Will not use again and would advise friends and family to do the same. They are good when things go right but not when things go wrong. Ill update to advise if I actually get my refund as the item is still not tracking and Asos dont seem to careBrand reputation is important, when its been ruined its hard to repair"
"May 21, 2018",1,Absolute worst customer service and policies.,"Clothes are decent, but the customer service is terrible. I qualified for a promotion that was happening, returned part of my order because it did not fit, and the entire promotion was taken off and i received no compensation for my refund. I even actually went NEGATIVE sending back clothes because i needed to buy a box to do so. This doesn't add up, because the promotion had different levels of qualification. I still qualified for the promotion, but simply not the original monetary amount. I returned $105 of clothes, lost my $100 of promotion (which means $5 refunded for $105 worth of clothes,)  and am left with a live-chat response of somebody who has no clue of my situation. First time buying from the company, and it's my last. I'm also returning the ENTIRE order. A large company pulling a shady tactic looks terrible, and i do not want to fund a company that's cutting corners with my own money."
"May 21, 2018",1,Robotic and ridiculous system,"Purchased an item, returned it which they received yet days go by and no refund.I contact asos eventually who state a refund was issued yet I had received nothing. They wanted a bank statement from me to prove this, I went to the bank and got one printed out. They rejected it stating they can't accept photos or screen shots even though I took a picture for the whole month!! Then I got the same generic email 3 times explaining what I need to do. I didn't have a pdf attachment to attach to an email so photo of the statement was the only way... after losing my patience with their robotic email system, I found a contact number for asos online! (Strange how they never publish this on their apps and website).. Will see If it's resolved soon however shocking. Been an asos customer for 7 years and I will not shop here again. Ridiculous"
"May 21, 2018",1,DONT BE LURED IN BY THEIR DISCOUNTS,"SCAM ARTISTS with their frequent discounts to lure you in. I made an order with ¬£30 discount, and had to exchange a tshirt for a different size. Of course my size is out of stock, and instead of offering me an alternative size, they immediately issue the refund, HOWEVER, i only received ¬£12 back from the tshirt worth ¬£42 as they deducted the ENTIRE discount from the refund. SCAMMERS, didnt even try to ask if i wanted an alternative item or offer any future discount codes, i even said to send me back the oversized tshirt, they declined. BE VERY CAUTIOUS!!!"
"May 21, 2018",5,really good customer service,"After reading the trustpilot reviews, the common theme seemed to be that Asos was brilliant until things went wrong, so when things went wrong I wasn‚Äôt expecting a great outcome. The quality of their clothes is rather mixed, which for a company who sells many other brands is to be expected. I love the next day delivery service for a year for only ¬£9.99 (I think) and have never had a problem with it. I also love the range of clothes that they sell and find great outfit inspiration from their social media feeds. I have had a couple of things that have ended up with small holes but it is nothing that a sewing box can‚Äôt fix. 2 months ago I bought a pair of leggings for my sister that recently ripped in a trampoline park at the back (she was mortified and had to sit out on the bench the whole time). I was really annoyed at the situation, so messaged Asos, whilst the first person I spoke to offered me the solution of a replacement (which I explained was not appropriate) he must have passed this on to a separate team who dealt with the issue really effectively. They refunded the cost of the leggings, and the entrance fee to the trampoline park, and offered a goodwill voucher as an apology for the experience. My faith is truly restored in Asos, and I will be more than happy to continue shopping there."
"May 21, 2018",5,Always fantastic,Always fantastic. I'm so surprised by the low reviews here as every single time I order with ASOS they have been fantastic. The clothes are good quality and the delivery is so quick. Returns are easy too. I would recommend ASOS to anyone!
"May 21, 2018",2,The only reason I still rarely shop on‚Ä¶,"The only reason I still rarely shop on ASOS is because they have the most decent plus size options for online shopping. Their customer service is absolutely horrid though... doesn‚Äôt matter how simple your request is, they‚Äôre literally always ‚Äúunable‚Äù to help you. It‚Äôs pure and utter crap."
"May 21, 2018",4,Size was a bit small for clothing not‚Ä¶,Size was a bit small for clothing not as advertised
"May 21, 2018",5,Nothing but great things!!!,"I'm honestly baffled by the low reviews. I've ordered from Asos at least twice a month since December and have had nothing but amazing service. They carry many different brands so sizing is not always consistent but anything that doesn't fit, I send back and get a full refund. People are always complementing my clothes now and they are now used to me always saying it's ASOS. I love them!!!"
"May 19, 2018",1,Sad I can't give 0 stars,Sad I can't give 0 stars. I've order on 3rd of  May and they can't manage to deliver. Now askin to wait until 24th of May so they might have an update! So won't offer refund or the items!! Rubbish company
"May 19, 2018",1,Flawed Returns and Refund Procedures.,"I returned two orders about two weeks ago, requesting a refund. ASOS supposedly provides no-hassle free shipping AND returns. You‚Äôd think this is a great perk for the customer, however, their return procedures are flawed. Customers should beware. I waited the 10 days before reaching out about my return as ASOS says returns take up to 10 business days. When I received my packages they included return labels and instructions for making the return. Their marketing on their website and return instructions within the shipments tote a hassle free process. You‚Äôre simply supposed to remove the original shipment label on the package, replace it with the prepaid return label (paid and provided by ASOS) and then either leave it for your mail carrier or drop it in your local neighborhood mailbox bin for USPS to pick up. I did exactly as the instructions said. When I contacted ASOS regarding my return orders they asked for ‚Äúproof of postage‚Äù and said it was the responsibility of the customer to 1. add tracking to the return package and 2. also ‚Äúinsure the items‚Äù that are being returned. These steps are NOT included in their return instructions. When asked what is ‚Äúproof of postage‚Äù, I didn‚Äôt receive a concrete answer. After telling them that the return instructions DO NOT mention these additional steps, they resent me an email with the same script, repeating that I need to provide proof of postage and until I do that there is nothing they can do. I then asked them why they wouldn‚Äôt know the tracking information for the return label that THEY provided. They then sent me an email saying they looked up the tracking for they return labels they provided and said it came back as ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù. SO THE TRACKING NUMBER FOR THE RETURN POSTAGE ASOS PROVIDED IS INVALID?? AND SOMEHOW THAT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY AND FAULT?? They also looked this up for only one of the package orders I returned. So in a subsequent email I asked them to track the other second package. The ‚Äútracking number‚Äù that was assigned turned out to be the SAME as the other package they ‚Äúsupposedly‚Äù looked up: 1001000000000000000**SSN**1. ASOS are frauds. To end, the last email I received from them condescendingly advised the following ‚ÄúI can suggest contacting the carrier you returned your items with and asking for proof of postage or a tracking number‚Äù. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DO THIS? GO TO THE POST OFFICE AND ASK FOR PROOF OF POSTAGE FOR PACKAGES THAT ARE NO LONGER IN MY POSESSION AND HAVE BEEN MAILED 2 WEEKS AGO?? ASOS is a joke, and they do not care about their customers. I have scrolled through several customer review sites including this one, and this issue with refunds and returns goes back for YEARS. Why haven‚Äôt they updated their return instructions on the slip included in packages stating that customers should add tracking AND insure their items? Its because if they did, the return wouldn‚Äôt be considered free. Instead they place blame on the customer on the backend and refuse to honor returns. Save yourself the stress and money. Do not purchase goods through ASOS. I'll be submitting this review on others sites. Hopefully it helps others who review businesses before giving them their money. I will from now on."
"May 19, 2018",5,Amazing company..,Amazing company... I bought free delivery and returns for a year and it was the best investment ever. It‚Äôs so so so easy to use and such a great selection of items to chose from. It‚Äôs a great company!Although it takes around a week for a refund
"May 19, 2018",1,Poor service,"Poor service, sent me wrong product and refused to rectify issue. I lost out on my voucher that i used. Paul from customer service unhelpful. Disappointed, deffinetly won't be purchasing from them again"

"May 18, 2018",5,great,good company no issues so far
"May 17, 2018",1,Returns are dreadful,"Sent me the wrong item and when I contacted them they said they'd send a replacement because I already returned it 10 working days ago. ASOS are claiming they don't even have my returned INCORRECT item that they sent by mistake in the first place! To add insult to injury they tell me my item I originally ordered and paid for is now out of stock. Unbelievably so, they also told me I still needed to send them the item for me to receive the refund (Which I didn't want.. only wanted the item I actually ordered) So now they're withholding a refund I'm 100% entitled too because they won't acknowledge I sent the wrong item back - which I even proved with a dated postage receipt!! I used to love ASOS but I don't think I'll ever shop with them again, they've totally lost my respect."
"May 17, 2018",1,Bad Customer Service,Be careful if you have to return an item and used a promo code when you made a purchase.  I returned $161 of merchandise but only received $61 back because they took off the full promo I received when I made the purchase.  If I had returned $100 of merchandise I would have received a refund of $100 because the promo would still apply.  Makes no sense.  Most companies prorate the promo for the items you kept.  I would have received a larger refund if I had returned fewer items.  You could actually end up owning them money for returning items with the way their return policy works.  Avoid at all costs.  Spoke with a customer service rep and they just didn't care; it's the way it works.
"May 16, 2018",5,Excellent company,"Excellent company! Unique and good quality shoes and clothing, at a reasonable price due to constant sales. Have placed many orders and never had any problems with returns. Refunds are prompt. Highly recommended! Surprised to see so many negative reviews."
"May 16, 2018",5,Placed order,"Placed order, received item 2 days later - free p&p. Item received in the allocated time slot that was emailed & texted. Very happy with the trainers. Very competent & user friendly online service. Would recommend & use again. Many thanks."
"May 16, 2018",5,Positive experience,"I was very doubtful to buy in this website because of all the reviews I saw. However, I was looking for this dress I saw on The Voice and ASOS was the only store that had it, so I decided to give it a try. The dress arrive on time and it was the same size I asked for. The only detail is that it was missing a the belt that comes with the dress, but I asked them and they sent me whole new dress the next day (this time with the belt included). I would totally buy again from them."
"May 16, 2018",5,Love this website!,"Love this website, I've bought several items from clothes to watches and everything came through in perfect condition. The best thing about this website is free and easy returns process."
"May 15, 2018",5,My no.1 site for shopping,"I've been ordering from Asos for years now, probably over 50 times and I've always been very happy with the quality of products and fast shipping. Once my order got lost and never got delivered (it was mainly a problem at the post office) but I issued for a refund through paypal and they refunded me very quickly without ever needing to contact their customer service. I pretty much always find what i'm looking for and Asos is the first place I check. I love that they have so many different brands and lots of variety and different products, also their own Asos-line is fairly good quality and affordable. The catwalk videos really show their products better than any other sites. I don't really understand why they have only two stars, most of the  negative reviews seem to do with customer service and returns, of which I have no experience.. So maybe something for Asos to work on? Overall to me they seem like a very professional company (site works really well. never listing items that are not in stock. no ridiculous discount codes or bribing influencers..)"
"May 15, 2018",5,Wow so much negativity!!!!!,"Wow so much negativity!!!!!! I have ordered from Asos countless times and I have never had a problem. My only criticism is that it takes them ages to restock popular items. The website is easy to navigate, I find Asos own label clothing true to size, theres always something new in and even the standard delivery is quick (UK)."
"May 15, 2018",5,I do not understand why ASOS have only‚Ä¶,"I do not understand why ASOS have only 2 stars. I absolutely LOVE this company and it gets  better by the day. I shop here at least weekly and have never had a problem. If I have needed to contact customer service, they have always been so helpful and friendly. The ASOS A-LIST scheme is amazing too. Getting money back for spending money? Yes please. Also loving that they now stock brands like MAC and BOBBI BROWN"
"May 15, 2018",1,Ordered Black trousers for my holiday‚Ä¶,Ordered Black trousers for my holiday which is soon and ASOS sent me the completely wrong item (Black Swimsuit). I therefore contacted them for a replacement to receive the reply that they were now out of stock and I would have to return the the swimsuit i did not want at my own convenience and also keep checking the website MYSELF to see if they came back into stock. All bearing in mind this was their fault but I was the person having to go out of my way. I work in customer service and this is NOT service.
"May 15, 2018",2,They need to provide better customer support,"Customer support do not know their products - I sent images 3 times of the wrong size trainers that I was sent and I was still sent the wrong size a second time. Response time is too long to emails, chat etc.. I ended up buying another pair of trainers and when they arrived today they are as if they were already worn and just thrown in the box. the laces were untied and the trainers were not packaged well. For such a big company, they need to have a bigger customer support team."
