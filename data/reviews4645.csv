"February 16, 2021",4,As usual ASOS is dope,"Received an email right away with the tracking and got my order on time (in a week) with everything I ordered. So as usual, ASOS is great with that. Only downside was that one of the shirts was crumpled for some reason in a bag with a rubbed out barcode and another ripped label on top, which was wierd asl. The shirt itself had no tag, but was in perfect condition despite it being creased. Washed it twice in case. Other than that small nitpick, I can't wait to buy from ASOS again!"

"February 16, 2021",1,SHIPPING LOGISTICS IS FAILING,"Dear ASOS TEAM, You should work on Shipping Logistics since it is not working. You should be aware of shipping issues and contact the customer to keep them inform about any inconveniences. That way the customer can decide in time if they want refund or replacement before half of the items are sold out. I placed an order and it was never updated its tracking history. I kept reaching out through ASOS CHAT and they kept telling me the order will arrive soon even when it was already late for date expected to arrive. 13 DAYS after, I contacted back ASOS CHAT and they told me I could have a replacement or refund, not only I had to contact them for information of my order, but because of the time delay most of the items in my order were now out of stock. A week after I reach  out for a previous order and they told me they found the lost order and both are on the way. It’s been a month and I have received none of my two orders. Nor I can request a refund because they ask me to wait until  tracking history doesn’t update for a couple of days in a row. Recommendation: don’t order from ASOS ."

"February 15, 2021",1,Items missing- be ware!!,"Items missing- be ware!!! I paid for the next day delivery and was very exited to see my parcel arrive. When I opened the parcel I discovered that only a coat arrived but the trainers were missing! Contacted ASOS and they said the parcel was sent as one and they had no idea what happened to the trainers. They said they will refund for the trainers and then sort out replacement which should be done in about 4 days or more - I asked what about my next day delivery I paid for and they said well you not always get the solution you want. So I asked for refund and ordered another pair so I can get it the next day rather than like a week time - unfortunately though I lost 20% discount I got the previous day when I placed the original order. How can items go missing just like that, expensive trainers... seems dodgy... Don't trust them anymore what if more items will go missing??"

Surely I texted to help me and they said it is not possible cause they have sent it already and recommended me to find someone who can receive my order behalf. Great , but I have nobody,because we will be in Russia on 21st of February! Till April ! So I will not have time to send it back to you and receive my money. Also I must pay the big commission for this delivery round 200$ this is the rules in Korea. So thanks a lot,it is not a good service for such big company like ASOS . I will not order from here more , because I see the delivery date until 18th of February on my profile right now and I saw it while ordering that’s why I ordered! Good luck and f....you"

"February 15, 2021",1,Day light robbery,"Worst customer service, unhelpful and rude! Continuously did not listen throughout and sent the same solution multiple times when already mentioned I've tried this.I have had my monies stolen from Topshop which is now Asos and nor Topshop or Asos want to help. Asos, your reputation is sinking and will continue to sink if you're taking on the same level as customer service as Topshop. You both really should be proud of the stealing many customers monies.Why is this any different then a pick pocketer? Or card theft?"
"February 15, 2021",1,"Holding Money, Bad service","I have previously had good experiences with ASOS but the service has been an issue as of late.Three orders in the past month in particular:1. Missing item (not replaced because it was then out of stock)2. Incorrect item sent-- I received shorts rather than long pants in a totally different style. I was told I had to return this incorrect item to receive a refund and then also repurchase the desired item again. In order to receive the same price as originally ordered, they told me to purchase as-is, contact them again, and they would refund the promo amount. After some back and forth, they decided to send me a new code. So now I have paid for the desired item twice.3. Incorrect item received AGAIN. And they will not issue a refund for either item and told me to standby while they dig into the issue. I have now paid $100+ and am supposed to wait 10 days after my items are returned for my refund."

It is her Birthday today.  The system said that I had no orders and as a result I couldn't return the 2 items I needed to.I went onto your Live Chat and Jeffrey was absolutely fantastic.Had a great understanding of my problem and sorted it for me by producing a label and sending a QR Code to my email address.He asked all the right questions, was extremely professional, efficient, helpful and understanding.Jeffrey showed sensitivity too as I was feeling quite frustrated at the beginning of our conversation.He is a credit to you and a great ambassador for your organisation in Customer Care.I hope my comments reach him and that you let him know how much he is appreciated.He is doing a great job in these difficult times and I can't praise him enough."

"February 15, 2021",1,Worst customer service team ever,"I ordered some items on 8th January and they have never been delivered. I contacted their courier DPD who confirmed my address isn’t what ASOS gave to them. Despite this, it has now been 5 weeks and ASOS are refusing to issue me with a refund. I have been in touch with their customer ‘care’ team 8 times over their live chat and Facebook messenger and they literally just ignore me for days on end. I have now received an email stating that DPD are going to attempt to ‘retrieve’ the parcel from where they delivered it and redeliver a used item to me. I have also written to ASOS co plains department and they have ignored me even though they have signed for the letter. ASOS have now lost a loyal customer. Worst customer service I have ever dealt with"

"February 15, 2021",3,Wrong orders,just disappointing company to shop at some time. orders always going wrong and it’s not just me colleagues and friends all have the same problem with this company. When all we can do it order online at the moment just some care in the delivery and attention on the sizes  would be appreciated instead of going back and forth with returning the wrong items. It's a waste of my time and really bad to make customers who might be isolating/vulnerable to make returns and going into shops when they feel afraid.

"February 15, 2021",1,Terrible Customer Care,"Placed two separate orders for gift certificates for peoples birthdays, orders were placed two days in advance, confirmation of both orders was received immediately and money was taken from my bank account. 24 hours later received an e-mail saying the first order had been cancelled and my ASOS Account closed, no explanation. Contacted the online chat who basically could not help and said someone from their 'specialist team' would get back to me in 24 to 48 hours, explained that was no good as the birthday  in question was the next day but they said they couldn't do anything, basically tough s***! NOT GOOD ENOUGH BY A LONG SHOT."
"February 15, 2021",1,The services and process is very bad if something goes wrong,"Products don’t fit to size it’s always a guessing game. A lot of stock not in stock. Worst part of all is your experience of something goes wrong, this is when you truly see how much you are valued or not as a customer. My order never arrived, the picture DPD left was of a different address entirely, I went the address the front doors were wide open (as they were in the dpd picture) and there was builders in and out. It is a block of flats and was left in the entrance so anyone could have picked it up and walked away with it. Never the less 10 days later and no update, replacement or refund. I chased many times and even encountered a very rude advisor although the rest were polite. I wanted to share a video of the address versus me going into my home or a anything to provide evidence and no! I have to keep waiting and am £100 down. To top it off it was my birthday and I ordered some new jeans to wear for a birthday dinner that never arrived. Now I have come to see ASOS does not let you give feedback or review their service. They only allow for feedback on products or technical faults so they don’t effect their score. This is shocking and just overall I’m super upset. Ordering online is not the best at times but I have never had this issue so maybe this is normal. I just wanted some birthday jeans."

Not only did I pay for 2 day express for a wedding trip and items wont arrive until I'm gone... but ASOS customer service told me I can't get a refund because DHL is still delivering the package.  WOW! So I'm short of almost 400 dollars worth of merchandise and. nothing to wear for a wedding trip... and I""m the Bride.  This is painful, to say the least, and disappointed at the lack of effort customer service to resolve the issue"
"February 15, 2021",1,Totally useless,"Totally useless. When trying to make a return using Collect Plus (the service offered by Asos) I tried my two local collection points three times each, and each time the collection points refused to take my parcel (with excuses alternating between their machine being broken and/or that I could only make a drop-off if I went at 8am). Took me three different days of going out and walking around for 45-60 mins each time before I was finally able to return my parcel. Way too much hassle."
"February 15, 2021",1,Change your policy ASOS,"I have just received an order, to find ASOS sent me the wrong item, £10 cheaper than the goods I purchased. I contact customer care ASAP. Here I am told I would have to return the wrong item sent first, to then receive a refund or replacement. The person I spoke to said this was their policy and they had to do it this way. This is extremely unfair on the customer when the fault is not theirs and means I will have to wait much longer to receive my goods I’ve paid for, not to mention I paid for the Premier Delivery too. I also am disabled and struggle to get out and about, so this will affect my ability as to when I can return this item. Although this is nothing to do with ASOS and I’m aware when I purchase online if I do not like the product/does not fit etc, I at some point will have to return it, but this situation is completely not of my doing and a mistake by the company, yet they are not making any concessions to help me receive my goods sooner or make the situation easier for me. I’m very disappointed with their policy and the fact they did not wish to rectify it in a way that was more helpful to the customer. It’s made me look at ASOS very differently. It seems to me, a big company isn’t so caring about their customers satisfaction and therefore I in future will avoid purchasing from them and will try to help smaller companies when possible. I hope others will do the same too, so big companies learn to treat their customers fairly!!!"

My email was never answered, so I contacted the live chat. I talked to 3 different operators, and all 3 of them gave contradicting answers. The last one (Mary) was the most unhelpful.

First saying they are refunding my account and to wait ten days.  Well, no refund.  Then they said to wait another 10 days..no refund. Then they said they credited my account,  but they have not, my credit card statements prove they have not. Also, they asked me to give them copies of my credit card statements to look into the matter! That is shady.   A reputable business does not need its customers to send them personal credit card statements to find out if they processed a return.  Customer service is a joke.  Its often an automatic response system.  Also,  I had to repeat my story over and over again because no one had knowledge of it. I opened up a case with my credit card company will be getting my refund. They will deal with this terrible company."

They told me there was nothing they could do and i would not be receiving a refund.This is extremely frustrating as I purchased multiple items to use the promo code.

"February 15, 2021",1,Aggressive behaviour from Bren/Bret.,"Aggressive and rude service from Bren. All I was trying to do was get a tracking number for a jumper I’d ordered. I’d used an old email address that I had since forgotten, however I had proof that I’d made the order, such as order number, order details, proof of payment etc. Bren aggressively said “it’s your old email address at least you should remember it” nasty comments like that, instead of just helping me track my parcel. I have screenshots of the conversation showing how rude and aggressive he was to me, and will be posting these onto social media. I mean if you can’t let me know when my parcel is coming, that’s fine, but you don’t have to be rude about it. It’s only a jumper, not a block of gold. And I’m confused as to why ASOS would hire someone that speaks to people in this way? Are you intentionally trying to lose customers...? It seems they’re just giving jobs to anyone who can type at this point. No care for the customer at all. And I’m not the only one who has complained about this. A note to Bren/Bret: you do not know my circumstances or personal reasons, you don’t know what people are going through, don’t assume and speak to your customers as if they are dumb. Retailers are in such a precarious position right now, it’s in your own best interests to speak to your customers with some decency and respect. I will never be ordering from here again. Thanks."

They say I keep giving wrong information, am positive how I registered, passed from pillar to post and quite frustrated now.  Just want my £15 refunded. The birthday gift has now cost my £30 as did not want god daughter to miss out!  I keep requesting a refund, your team keep telling me I don't have an account and yet you managed to take the £15 from my bank account!  I am at a loss now and so so disappointed to have let someone down - this was the treat she wanted for her birthday and something a simple as a gift voucher should have been easy to process!!!!

They basically said sorry, nothing we can do, you can chase it up with our return courier and see how you go...If they have a contract with the return courier, I am very disappointed that they have no way to chase up lost/misplaced returns.I am out of pocket 52€ (glad it was not more!) I would advise against their ""free returns"" in Ireland and even the courier couldn't help me with it either so it seems I am out of options but to forget about the whole thing entirely, which puts me off using Asos entirely.Disappointed.."

"February 15, 2021",1,Lacking empathy and customer service. Happy to take your money,"I ordered on my account and set my new postal address as default, when the order placed it reverted to an old address that I no longer live at. Having noticed the mistake straight away I contacted support to get the address changed/ or the order cancelled so I could re order to my correct address. This is where the never ending disappointed started. They advised as I ordered with afterpay you cannot cancel or alter orders (which is not advised when purchasing, but is on a link they continuously send on the chats) , the parcel has to be sent all the way across the world to (hopefully) be rejected by the house it ends up at, then sent back to the UK until o receive a refund. Or I could try contact the courier to get it returned to sender. I contacted customer service on all levels to try get the parcel intercepted but I kept getting matching responses from every team member. No one offered to help me, they seemed to not care that potentially a parcel is going to go missing, because they have my money. They didn’t offer to contact the courier to RTS the parcel. 0 customer service. Along with the automatic responses they advised me  ‘since your order has been processed and successfully shipped to the courier, please contact the courier’ I then contacted the courier to be told ‘We are unable to request a return at the moment as the order has not been shipped. The whole process has been stressful, exhausting and disappointing. I know they are convenient and have lots of great products, but when 1 small thing goes wrong they will take your money and leave you to figure out how to fix it. Not worth it"

I contacted asos via the chat and they told me they would contact Hermes but a response would take 72 hours. 72 hours passed and I had to chase again - I was asked to wait another 72 hours. Hermes has lost my order and I can have a replacement if I want. I accepted and said I want it free next day as that’s what’ve paid for - nope you have to wait at least 6 days and is subject to stock availability. I can see now that most of my stuff is out of stock now anyway so what is the point - no compensation available and no way of speeding up the process apparently. I’m just tired and frustrated with this order that I’d rather just forget it ever happened and avoid asos in the future.

I like how easy the returns are, and how I am kept informed of refunds and deliveries. The site is easy to use, and they have so much to choose from. I find delivery is fast, and items come together (not separately like some other sites). Yes not all items I like, so I send them back. That’s to be expected with on line shopping, you don’t fully know what you  are getting and how it will look on you until it arrives. But, I just send it back What I don’t want ."

"February 15, 2021",2,Asos makes a mistake. I'm the one who pays?,"I used a 20% off code and ordered a T-shirt, size M. Stoked. They sent me a coat, size XL.  Not stoked. After 30 mins of chatting about or *their* mistake, ASOS's way of making this right was for me to send the wrong item back, and within 10 days after, they'd process a refund. (Oh..okay?  But about that shirt I ordered...). So their idea of making that part ""right"" was for me to REORDER the item I originally ordered and they didn't send, pay for it-- plus shipping--AGAIN, but because the promo code expired, it'll cost me 20% more. But not to worry. Once they decide to give me my money back for their mistake, they'll send me a new code I can use on a future order. Naah. Any company that makes a customer pay--as in actual, real money--to remedy their mistake? I'm out. The fact that they've not responded to any Trustpilot critical reviews in more than a year should tell you all you need to know.  Too bad I learned this the hard way."

"February 14, 2021",1,IMPOSSIBLE TO RETURN AN ITEM,"I have been trying to return an item for over a month with back and forth emails just trying to get a return label that I could print, as some shops dont accept asos's 'paperless returns'. After at least 15 emails with conflicting advice I was told to print the barcode and stick that to my return. The shop accepted the return but now the parcel has gone missing in the tracking, and I have no idea where my return is and when if ever I will finally get refunded. It took weeks of emails just to be able to return my order and now I have no idea where my return is or when I will finally be able to get my money back.This has been the worst customer experience I've ever had. It should not be so difficult to return an item, especially as one reason for returning is that I was sent the wrong size to what I ordered in the first place."

Hopefully I can receive it as soon as possible with no issues."
"February 14, 2021",1,Unprofessional,I've been an ASOS customer for a number of years and have made various orders. There was no reason given as to why my account was blocked and the customer assistant refused to give me any details. I wanted to make use of the 20% discount code available today but unfortunately I can't do that anymore. The items I wanted are already in low stock as well so most likely it will be gone by the time my account gets looked into.Very unprofessional from ASOS!

I've had them telling me to contact the account holder and also the manufacturer...Levi Strauss to get this information, it is absolutely laughable and also shocking. I'm stuck with a pair of jeans worth 60 quid that will never get used. So avoid if you don't have an account. Good luck"

"February 14, 2021",1,Failed to dispatch goods or even attempt delivery,"Placed an order for 2x pairs of jeans on 3rd February with an expected delivery date of 8th Feb. Items never dispatched by ASOS, the courier has no record that they received the items, and therefore the order was not delivered on the expected due date. Automatic email received on 13th Feb to say that I had returned the items and a refund would be processed in due course. Jeans now no longer in stock and unable to re-order items. Contacted ASOS (chat reference 33527164) who failed to provide any further information and unable to help. I spent £171 and have nothing to show for it - ASOS failed to provide a service and didn't even attempt to deliver the goods that I ordered. Incredibly disappointing."

Requested a refund as I would rather go elsewhere with faster more reliable shipping but was told to wait for this investigation to be completed? Unacceptable considering this was for an occasion and just want my money back at this rate.

"February 14, 2021",1,Pathetic.,"Ordered an item on the 6th Feb for my wife’s birthday on the 18th.Hermes had it on the 6th but still no delivery by the 12th. Checked the tracking and said they still had it. Spoke to ASOS customer service who said they’d open an investigation to find out what was happening but it takes 48 hours. Spoke to ASOS again on 14th (I’ve done all the chasing, nobody has once got in touch with me) and apparently it’s on it’s way back as it was damaged in transit. Cheers for letting me know...now I only have a few days now to find a replacement present. Can’t order it again as it’s now out of stock in her size. No offer of any discount (other than the 20% I had when ordering originally) to help me buy an equivalent item which are more expensive. No offer to even give me next day delivery to make sure if I buy something it actually turns up. They still have my money for 10 days while I wait for refund. What if I didn’t have any money to buy her anything else with. Total disregard for customers situations. Absolutely shocking service. Waiting for specialist team to call me who will no doubt apologise and say there is nothing they can do. Pathetic. Happy Valentine’s Day."

I checked the status of my order and it had not been processed so I attempted to cancel and reorder with the code. I was not permitted to cancel order even though it wasn't processed.

"February 14, 2021",1,ASOS is a DISASTER,"I ordered an £80 dress two weeks ago and was told it would be delivered 4 days after I ordered it. I then contacted ASOS four days ago as it had still not been delivered and there had been no updates. The person I spoke to then contacted Hermes who told them they had lost the parcel- but I was not informed of this! So I then had to contact them again today only to find out they still hadn’t sent me a replacement. They refuse to give any sort of refund or discount, despite me having spent hours trying to sort it out. I have also been informed the replacement might not turn up for 5 DAYS! Honestly- the service is dreadful and has put me right off."
"February 14, 2021",1,Misleading & Waste of time,I would suggest that ASOS refrains from sending out emails like “20% off EVERYTHING using code ****”but then when you go to check out the code doesn’t apply on the items you chose. The is time misleading and time consuming.

Order status was incorrect so had to contact customer service to process a manual return (annoying but ok). After about a week, the return was received and I was refunded for 2 of the items but not the 3rd? Called customer service who apologised and promise a refund of £44 (item was £55 but had 20% discount on).. several days later I receive a refund for £28? Called customer service who apologised and promised they’d get it rectified so that I got the £44 refund promised. Then receive an EMAIL to say actually no £28 is all you can have and have been passed around to several useless staff members since then. Terrible customer service. Won’t be using ASOS again."

""Anna"" was the lovely person who helped me online customer service and she was so patient. She let me tell her the circumstance and clarified that if the jacket came without a belt, then it was deemed 'FAULTY'. She was happy to send me a replacement jacket (free of charge)! I was surprised by this unexpected service. In all my years of purchasing from ASOS - I had never had a mistake made by them... but this one time there is a hiccup, they are willing to replace is so promptly. Thank you Anna for being patient, explaining the steps to me and clarifying many details so I could understand. It was challenging online to communicate and understand each other with having to type the situation... but you listened and you also supported me every step of the way. Thank you for your help and good heart. You've made me feel really happy to continue purchasing from your company."
"February 14, 2021",5,Help in the chat...,My order did not arrive so I received a refund.

After browsing the desired products and i scroll down and note that there is shipping restriction to Singapore. It’s kind of waste of time and i experience with many Nike products but not all Nike products.Sometimes i forget and just click and put it in my bag.After spending quite a lot of time shipping and thinking I have accumulated enough for free shipping only to realise some are restricted. By this time, i will not proceed to add other items to make up the figure. And give up all the purchase totally.May i suggest u could add an option in your filter for us to click to display only those items that are available to ship to , for e.g., my delivery address/Country?

"February 13, 2021",1,The Biggest Disappointment......,"I recently downloaded the ASOS app and filled my wishlist with pieces I was incredibly excited about. I started to make my final decision by putting things in my cart when I noticed one of my fav items was the last one. I rushed through checkout and only after receiving my confirmation email did I realize I had forgotten the promo code. I reached out to customer service to see if the discount could be retroactively applied or the discount could be refunded, especially because it was still active. I was told nothing could be done and that I could try to place another order. I know I’m only one of millions of your customers in this incredibly competitive “Post Covid” online retail environment, and it’s clear ASOS not only doesn’t value my business, it doesn’t believe in doing something simple to make my first experience a pleasant one. As someone who works in retail customer service, I would have done better for my customer. I’ll be returning my items as soon as they arrive and taking my patronage somewhere it’s truly valued. I work too hard for my money to be discarded."

"February 13, 2021",1,Very poor service from ASOS,"Micaela offered prompt feedback and was helpful as far as her guidelines allowed her to be. My low rating is due to my complete dissatisfaction with the general service from ASOS. My order never arrived and was returned and refunded for no apparent reason. There was no attempted delivery and no apology or explanation as to what had happened. Micaela was unable to offer me any compensation/good will gestures and was only able to restore the original discount code I used in my order (as is only fair). I have asked her to pass on my dissatisfaction to her supervisor. Not only did I not receive the parcel on time but I've also had to spend my time using a poor chat function to try and find out what had happened. Despite all of this customer inconvenience, no discount code/something similar was offered. This is very poor service and sincerely puts me off ordering from you again."

I paid 18 euro for next day delivery and out of 6 orders I placed 3 of them took over 2 days to come. Blaming it on the weather and COVID every excuse under the sun. They are advertising it as next day which is false. I asked for a refund and they said it’s not possible as I received the parcel so apparently a huge company like ASOS is happy with a 50% ratio. Appauling service and appauling customer service

Do not shop with them ! I repeat do not shop with them!
"February 13, 2021",1,Asos refund policy sucks.,Asos refund policy has put me off continuing being a customer. Faulty products are returned for inspection and only possibly given a refund?

"February 13, 2021",1,Half of order refunded with zero notice.,"I have experienced so many cases of extremely poor service from ASOS. This has been mostly the delivery provider, Hermes’ fault, however recently I have had issues from ASOS itself from an operational standpoint. Recently I placed an order with 9 items in it via the app. My order arrived and 3 items were missing. I checked my email and the app to see if I had been given any notice as to why they were not here or if it was a mistake. There was nothing and my account said that my order of 9 items had been delivered successfully. I contacted customer service who informed me that actually 3 items were out of stock. But I had not received any notice of this at all and was expected to investigate myself. Disappointed with the service. Very poor from such an established company - expect better but unfortunately am so often disappointed from ASOS that I now tend to shop elsewhere as I am so frequently let down."
"February 13, 2021",5,Returning items from Guernsey...,Returning items from Guernsey is quite difficult as there’s no straightforward option via the app. Having contacted Customer Care I was directed to a chat-box and put through to Sheila who was super helpful and happy to help.

"February 13, 2021",4,Sent 2 left boots,I've just live chatted with Krystal from their customer care team and she was very nice to deal with. I ordered a pair of Vero Moda white boots last February and I've only just gone to wear them and to my shock and disbelief I went to put them on and noticed that there was not a right boot in the box and that I'd actually been sent 2 left boots. At the start they said because the order was place over a year ago that they couldn't offer me a refund or replacement but after I'd mentioned that I don't know anybody who as 2 left feet and that the boots aren't fit for purpose I must say Krystal did in fact sort the situation out and sent me a returns label. I would of preferred it if they would actually send me the other right boot but I guess they might not have that stock left so I've now got to send the boots back for their warehouse team to inspect the boots and they will reach a decision and get back to me. I'm hoping that I will receive my refund that I'm entitled to but you never do know with these big retailers. I can't see why not because I've never worn them so they have no choice really. Come to think about it surely they must have someone who checks the orders before they're sent out. Fingers crossed

But it gives you the option to write additional notes in a box below the item after you’ve chosen your reason as to why you’re sending it back? What’s the box for then?!!! Spoke to a lady online who was less than helpful too. Not great customer service. Issue not resolved. Also lost the discount on item now too. I lost out on the items I wanted and ASOS you lost a customers money by refunding the items back

Kristal told me she would request it to be redelivered and get back in contact with me. This never happened so I messages and was lied to by Jeoh who told me it had been redelivered that day so I went to the shop again and it wasn't there. Messaged again and was told I'd get another update but to wait 10 days after delivery. Waited and no update as expected so messaged AGAIN and spoke to Bernadette and MariaAngelica who were just useless and offered no help and said I'd just have to wait with no timeframe for how long. Overall terrible experience.
"February 13, 2021",4,Bad first experience was redeemed by second experience,The first individual I was in contact with was not helpful in my opinion and cut my chat off. I went straight back on and got a lovely person who wanted to help and got me the information that I needed in a very timely manner. If I was basing this of the first person they would just about have got a 1 star but my second experience redeemed it as she deserved 5 stars. They should all be like the second employee as I was very impressed.

"February 13, 2021",2,Do Not Pay For Their Shipping Membership,Do not pay for their shipping membership. It’s a total ripoff. I paid for the membership. My order was shipped out in two parcels. The second parcel was shipped out one day after the first. This has caused a huge delay in me receiving the second parcel. ASOS had nothing to offer but an apology. If you cannot honor shipping times due to “COVID” then stop charging people for an express membership.

"February 13, 2021",1,Appalling customer service,"I made a next day delivery order and after it didn't arrive got in touch with customer services to enquire about it. I was told to wait 3 working days for it. When it still didn't arrive I spent over an hour trying to resolve my order issue. Half my items were now out of stock and I re issued my order for the next day. I was assured it will arrive the next day but never got a confirmation of my updated order. When I got in touch again I was told the replacement order will take up to 6 days to be processed, therefore it won't be arriving the next say. Just appalling and very frustrating treatment from costumer services. I mentioned time after time that I urgently needed some items from my order and almost a week later I've been forced to cancel my order."
"February 13, 2021",1,Bad customer service,I spoke to a Rachel lady today about getting my refund back for an express delivery i paid for but she was so unhelpful. The chat lasted for 1 hour and she kept quiet for the thirty minutes. i have my chat transcript.
"February 13, 2021",1,Never had any issues until now,"Never had any issues until now. I had ordered two of exactly the same item from the same brand, just different product numbers. But identical in look, style and packaging. I was going to see which fitted best and send the other ones back. Simple right? When the items arrived, the product numbers on the item packet were different to that online. Therefore, I contacted ASOS team online (as that’s the only way to contact them). All I needed was for that member of the ASOS team to identify which product number was which as mentioned the product numbers on my online account were different to that on the physical item, therefore I couldn’t identify which product was which to make a refund creation.  Unfortunately, Glenn could not figure it out we went round and round in circles and in the end the chat got disconnected.  No one bothered to contact me back even thought that member of staff was aware this was unresolved and we were having major issues with sorting it out, and he couldn’t find a resolve. So without a solution, the only thing I can do is send back the whole order.I then try and contact their team again, again no number and would email or phone so I use the online chat and this time get Jonnie, ask him if could have an email or phone number so I can contact someone directly. He copied and pasted a link for this site and said that there’s no email. After that he went silent and I get an auto message to say I’m now chatting to Mary. Mary doesn’t answer, I type out several messages and neither Jonnie or Mary respond.....not very good customer service is it? Oh and my issue yet again is still unresolved! Where do I go from here? Is anyone out there to help me or do I just figure it out for myself?"

"February 13, 2021",1,So unbelievably awful,"So unbelievably awful. Customer centricity should be the cornerstone of every business but in the case of ASOS it's the last thing in their strategy, it seems.Order a gift voucher in advance, ask for it to be delivered on a future date, for a birthday gift.They take the money. They don't deliver the gift voucher, so someone goes without a birthday gift.You contact ASOS. They are completely disinterested.Someone will get back to you in 3-5 days they tell you on their online chat. Then they have the audacity to say ""there's no need to reply to this message"" like their word is final.For such a large company, this is just unacceptable.Put the customer first, ASOS. Not last."
"February 13, 2021",1,I ordered an item,"I ordered an item, later on realized it won’t arrive on time that was 2-3 hours after I ordered it! I couldn’t do anything so I contacted Asos, guess what they said after 1 hour that you have ordered there is nothing we can do! That is some bu***** ! Last time ordering here!!!$"
"February 13, 2021",1,"Unrealistic delivery options, paying for a best guess delivery time",Delivery options indicate a higher level of service than can be provided. Next day is only estimated however this is not intimated anywhere when purchasing. Needs better regulation and customer expectation management when spending their money so the service being provided and paid for to have delivery expedited is delivered.

It was honestly such a pleasant experience as I was worried that perhaps they wouldn’t believe me. But the whole thing from start to finish was just so easy.

On Friday I contacted ASOS after not having had any correspondence with anyone regarding the parcel all week and customer service said, “yes it’s on its way back to us, you’ll have a refund in up to 10 working days” barely an apology and definitely no attempt to rectify the situation with compensation or to resend. Very disappointed by ASOS customer service on this occasion as having to potentially wait 2 weeks for a refund of a parcel that I never even saw is unacceptable."

"February 13, 2021",1,Customer Service Nightmare,"I made an order in January 8, 2021. I ordered before without any problems before. I forgot about my order a couple for a couple of weeks and haven't got an update from FedEx. I checked my order and I was shocked to learn that I accidentally put my work address (I thought I put my home address). I contacted customer service with ASOS and they told me that they could not help and that I should contact FedEx. I did that as ASOS told me but, when I contacted FedEx, they could not make the change due to the type of delivery they attached to the order and that only ASOS can make the change. So again, I went back to ASOS and again they said they could not make the change. I tried again with FedEx but, i called for a LIVE person to speak to on the phone. The person on phone said that they could help and change the address and it would be updated once it got to the FedEx Facility and it would be no problem sending it to my house. I checked the tracking again a couple of days later but, nothing has been updated, so i called again FedEx and explained what had happened and it was noted. The LIVE person from FedEx said that it would not be an issue and said that it would be updated on next business day. I waited through the weekend and checked mid-week and saw that it was being sent back to ASOS warehouse. I was floored when I checked my tracking number. I called again to FedEx and I was MAD and I yelled at the person on the line for a good 10min. They did not deserve that but, they gave me ""I am sorry speech"" which pissed me off. I was so upset i filed a complaint with FedEx and that is when I decided to contact ASOS again  to see if they can change it to ship to my home (which i thought it would be easy to do, since they can only change it). I was on their chat and they started to give me the ""I am sorry speech"" too. All they can do is refund me? I didn't want a refund, i just wanted what I ordered. I am so pissed off with both ASOS and FedEx - I can't believe they both could not just change an address for me and have it reshipped. I would have paid for shipping again or would have picked up my package at the nearest FedEx store near where it was delivered. They both could not help me with what I call a simple fix. -I had to give it at least a 1 star but, I really would have not put any at all!"

The problem was that the promo code had glitched off my order and didn’t go through. So I was just seeing if it could be applied after the fact. She then proceeded to give me solutions for if I hadn’t already ordered it. So I told her 3 times it’s already been ordered and gave her my order number and she’s like I already have it. And then  she tried to give me a promo code to replace it but all I’ve asked for and kept asking for is a credit or refund on the $22 that would be made up for the promo. Then she left me on read, DIDNT say anything else but an automated “moving this higher” message and gave me a customer service survey. This has been the worst and most unhelpful customer service ever."

My package is clearly lost and you just keep blaming the pandemic. Don't take orders during a pandemic if you can't deliver and don't have the customer service to assist. Customer service kept making excuses that ASOS doesn't have the staff for a call center or to follow-up with the shipping carrier. There isn't even a record of my parcel and no tracking number. I deserve a full refund and all I was told to do repeatedly is just keep waiting for it. Um no, that's not how this works. I will be reporting ASOS to the Better Business Bureau. You have lost a customer and I will advise everyone I know to never do business with you. This isn't my first issue, and all my friends have has issues as well. There is a reason you are not doing well financially. You really should invest resources in customer service. It's so simple to refund my money for an item you didn't deliver. Stealing isn't how you get ahead. BYE ASOS"

All they had to do was check my account I want to log a complaint and I want a supervisor or manager to contact me before I take this furtherYou have told me a item not hit for purpose and I’m sure that’s illegal!!!!!"
"February 12, 2021",1,Customer service not there for customer,"Unlike other retailers, Asos doesn’t auto apply promo codes (even with account.) Only one chance to enter promo, no return to Asos to verify order after Afterpay step, just a flat “no” from customer service for helping me apply promo code I missed. Other retailers are not like this. What is customer service for, exactly? Customers are completely on our own."

"February 12, 2021",1,The new returns policy does not work and customer service refuse to help,"Asos’s new policy asks you to return multiple orders in the same bag to save the environment and reduce the number of parcels. This policy is too good to be true and 3 of my items that have been returned in the same bag have not been refunded yet I have received refunds on the other items. I am missing £130 and customer service have said they cannot look into this for 10 days. I have confirmation they have received the bag, a partial refund and proof of postage so it makes no sense to delay some of the money. Asos’s own customer service advised me against using combined returns?! And their protocols clearly do not match the new policy!"

I contacted them to advise them that they mailed me the incorrect item, and was initially asked what my desired resolution would be, either refund or replacement. I selected replacement. After chatting with numerous of their robotic service people through live chat (they don't have a call center you can call) they continuously advised me that they cannot provide a replacement although the item showed as still in stock. They wanted me to ship the item back, wait 3-5 business days for a refund to be processed, purchase the item again and then wait for it to arrive again praying that it is the correct item this time. I told them that I'm not waiting an additional 2-3 weeks because of their own error. I told them I'm going to initiate a chargeback with my credit card company and their response was that I am within my rights to do so, they even encouraged me to leave a trust pilot review about the incorrect item process so that it would ""later likely be changed"""

I had to order a few sizes before I found the one that I wanted so I needed to do a couple of returns. For the first order that I placed with ASOS I signed in as a guest and I have been trying to return the order for weeks now. I've been online chatting and emailing with customer service and still I have no return label. I'm guessing the issue is due to my being signed in as a guest, however, I did provide the order number, my name and a lot of other information that they asked for. I'm not sure why it's been so hard to locate this order. I am a little concerned now that it's taking so long that I won't be able to get my full money back. In the meantime, I have received the size I want and am very happy with the product. I am hoping this experience ends well so that I will not hesitate to order from ASOS in the future."

So fourth time getting in touch I was a little apprehensive, but I received such fab service ( restored my faith in asos again!!).

Date came and went so used Hermes app to track order however update never changed for days so I emailed asos to find out what was happening. They said they would get in contact with carrier and to allow 48 hours for a response.

I was told the items had never left the warehouse and there had been a issue, resulting in my order being refunded to me without ever arriving. When I made the order I used a 20% discount code, and I was advised to re-order the items immediately and contact customer service so that they could reapply the discount for me on the new order. I did exactly this, only to be told I had been ‘misinformed’ by the previous customer service team member and that I could not be reimbursed the difference as the order had now been processed. Poor and unfair treatment on the part of customer service. Responses are slow and very unhelpful."
"February 12, 2021",1,Robotic customer service. I’d have more luck making a wish at 11.11,"Awful recent experience! After ordering a click and collect parcel, it supposedly couldn’t be delivered to the store. I then had to chase Asos for an update, in speaking to them many of the answers were copy & paste. The items are now supposedly being delivered to me (at my address) but with the address of the store.... I’ve once again tried to reach out to Asos, only to be told I’ll have to try locate the parcel or I’d get a refund IF the parcel is returned to them! On replying to that message, asking what happens if I can’t locate the parcel (I shouldn’t have to if Asos has provided the wrong address to the courier! For the record, the shop doesn’t feature on my address book despite Asos suggestion that I need to correct that) I went onto mention that this item was ordered last weekend on a next day basis & despite my efforts to redirect it to my address the only answer the robotic support could come up with is that I leave feedback here!!"

I placed a order and received it tampered with and items missing. I reported to ASOS straight away and was told my account had been blocked and I would not get a refund on missing items and if I wanted to return any I would have to pay for my return.

"February 12, 2021",1,I ordered with two day (paid extra)…,I ordered with two day (paid extra) shipping and haven’t received my package. I’ve chatted with someone on your website who said they couldn’t help me and I would receive an email about my order. The email said that I need to track my order from my shipping email. Only problem is I never received a shipping email and my order still just says ordered. I responded with a frustration email. Then the response email said again no one could help me and I would receive another email in 48-72 hours. Seriously!?! I better get a shipping refund or something. This is ridiculous. Worst experience I’ve had with you guys!!
"February 12, 2021",2,Awful support/purchase help,"The person who helped me was fine. It was your system that I struggled with. Your shipping date was way off and I had no way of knowing that. You sent me an email after it should have arrived saying that, ""now that your purchase has arrived, rate it"" which concerned me about my delivery being wrong. Also, parts of your website led me to nowhere, and you never got back to my email I had sent through the ""contact"" option on your website. I think I'll be a first time and one time buyer. The person I spoke to in the chat was at least helpful enough to track my package for me(which makes no sense why he could, but it said that their tracking service wasn't working for me) which is why this isn't a 1 star."
"February 12, 2021",3,"Never received the order, no full refund","I had an order that was not returned on my request. I haven’t even received it, Aramex received the shipment with damaged goods, I think the shampoo was spilled. The parcel was returned back to Asos, I received the return notification for only one item in the order. The shampoo was not refunded. Please note that I am not responsible for the damage nor am I responsible for the return request. I should have received a full refund for all items."
"February 12, 2021",3,Representative was helpful,"Representative was helpful. However, the communication on ASOS end is poor. I have received zero updates regarding my returns.I had ordered a pair of Nikes in a size six. When my order arrived I received a 6.5.  I then ordered the same pair again in a 6. When they arrived I received a 6.5...again. I alerted the customer service team of this issue and initiated a return for both incorrect shoes. After two weeks I have yet to receive any updates on my return status. The return tracking numbers on my end show the returns were delivered to ASOS warehouse days ago despite this my returns page has yet to be updated.I am extremely disappointed and disheartened in ASOS and threat ability to provide adequate service at this point."

"February 12, 2021",2,Shipped multiple wrong sizes then blamed me for it,"I placed an order for two pairs of the same sneaker (yes I love them that much) with a 20% coupon code despite the many reviews stating that customers received the incorrect size. I received my order and to my dismay both sneakers were sent a size smaller (US 8) when I had ordered a US 9. Super disappointed that I would now have to start a return process but understood mistakes happen. I reached out to customer service via the online chat and was further incensed after being met with a very abrupt customer “service” rep or BOT (who knows) that proceeded to put the blame on me for ordering the incorrect size and refusing to provide me with a new code. I sent this rep a screenshot with proof that I had in fact selected the correct sizing and was still met with a matter of fact attitude. It’s 2021 so of course I decided to reach out via Twitter (this of course after I had already started the return process) and was just wanting confirmation that I would get a new code and the correct sizing. Again, for some reason I was being told that I had made the error, once again I provided the screenshots of my order receipt and finally was told in a very winded yet pointed way that I had indeed ordered my correct size and the error was on ASOS’ end. I was told to return the item for inspection and once I did so I would be given a new code. Yep...send it back FOR INSPECTION....where is this quality control of inspection when shipping the products to your customers?! Especially considering the MANY reviews from customers that have had the same issues with incorrect sizes being sent. I get it...it’s a pandemic and yes everyone is doing the best they can but I think your service reps and your shipping department is lacking."

"February 12, 2021",1,Canadians Beware,"Bought and returned a dress to ASOS last summer,  for which I had paid over $100 in tax and duties. Red flag number one was how much of a disaster it was to get ASOS to provide the necessary forms/info needed to get a tax and duty refund from the CBSA. After much back and forth (months), they finally helped me out. A few months later, the CBSA rejects my refund request because the return label (sent by ASOS) shows that the package went from Toronto to another area of Ontario. Since there’s no proof of the item being exported out of Canada, I can’t get refunded. I have tried to get a document from ASOS to show that the item was successfully exported but they refuse to help out. I would’ve exported the item myself if I knew that ASOS was so complicated to deal with. Worst part is that customer service kept repeating that showing a proof of refund is enough and to speak to the CBSA when I actually had a letter from the CBSA saying proof of refund wasn’t enough. 0/10, would not recommend if you’re Canadian."

"February 12, 2021",1,misleading information on the origin of the products and delivery costs,"I placed an order on the Canadian version of the website. The free shipping option was offered to me, but I had to pay a delivery charge.If these are customs fees, because I live in Canada, this should have been clearly stated when ordering.I find it misleading and wrong to tell a user that shipping is free when in fact there are costs to be expected. And the fact of offering a Canadian version of the site with prices in Canadian dollars does not allow the user to guess that the products come from the US, and that he will have customs fees (and additional fees at his expense in product returns).I am therefore dissatisfied and plan to share this disappointing experience with those around me."

"February 11, 2021",1,AWFUL,"Responses slow, order missing, no contact initiated after that point unless I did it myself, slow, different people each time just spewing out generic sentences, unhelpful, not responding to questions just sending me templates. Awful customer service, awful resolution skills and extremely awful time manner. I wouldn’t mind about the time if I didn’t have to reexplain myself each time or get answers. A little goes a long way but you don’t even get a little at the moment from your CS teams."

Here are my last two experiences:- I placed an order just because I wanted a pair of jeans. I added two more items, just to get the Free delivery service. Days after placing the order, they refund the money of the pair of jeans, because it was out of stock (was not out of stock when I placed the order, though). I ended up receiving the 2 other items I didn't really need, and one of them is completely different than the photo, so I will have to return it.- I placed an order of 20 items (!). I decided to get all of them cause I could get a really good discount, with a promo code they were offering that day. Seven days after placing the order, I got an email that they sent a refund for the order. I spoke with the customer service, and they told me there was some problem with the delivery so they had to cancel the order and refund. I am completely disappointed, as most of the items are out of stock now, and I cannot use the promo code anymore, so I cannot get the offer I originally got. They said they can send another promo code in the next days, but most probably the items will not be available until then... Completely disappointed."

I was not made aware prior to the purchase that there were items that were ineligible for next-day delivery. Had I known, I would not have purchased those items or purchase through ASOS. I also lost a day in looking for alternative options. For that reason, I requested to be compensated for those items + the cost of premier subscription and next-day delivery that I added with this purchase order. The first conversation with Alysa was disconnected somehow. I then spoke with MichelleAnn who was great but was either unable to or not empowered to accommodate my request. Per MichelleAnn, the investigation on the delay with the courier had to be completed prior to any credit. As the paying customer, that doesn't make sense since we know that I'm not responsible for the delay. My suggestion is that MichelleAnn should be able and empowered to process credits in scenarios where it's clear there was error on the part of ASOS or the courier."

"February 11, 2021",1,Firstly ‘Ben’ from the customer service…,"Firstly ‘Ben’ from the customer service chat team should be fired for his pathetic attempt at customer service. I ordered a £5 headband from ASOS about 2 weeks ago considering I pay for the £9.95 subscription which includes next day delivery for the year, 1st attempt at the delivery was lost, I had no idea, ASOS failed to inform me so after a week in contacted them, they offered to send another, I said yes assuming they would send it next day? I ordered on the 2nd its now the 11th Feb and no sign of the package.I contacted ASOS and spoke to Ben, he literally didn’t even give me my tracking number for my new headband, so I have no idea where it is, he wouldn’t even offer me any kind of compensation like maybe 10% of for the inconvenience for the item that is 9 days late. He told me to wait till the 16th of Feb when I ordered. He said ‘I understand you’ve been waiting weeks for your parcel’ ok… thanks for that Ben…super helpful…he then said ‘mistakes happen’ any compensation? No not allowed. I ordered on the 2nd and I should get next day delivery? He then decided that he helped me enough, no explanation on why he couldn’t offer me anything, and ended the chat. He gave me no reassurance when it should arrive, nor did he give me a chat reference to come back to if the next delivery still doesn’t arrive? How useless can you be really? The fact is he wouldn’t even offer me anything for a £5 headband? Makes me wonder if I actually ordered something expensive? Surely if you pay for the nest day subscription you should receive some sort of compensation for a two-week late delivery? I then had to contact the chat again, spoke to Antonette, she reassured me she'd help me, gave me a timeline on when it should arrive and a chat ref number and if the next one doesn’t what I should do next, and then offered me 10% of my next purchase. Easy simple and helpful.I’m just writing this in the hope that Ben loses his job and never gets a role in customer service again."

The customer service ended the call when I asked for the money back, of course I would not recommend anyone to order from the site just shocking !!!"

"February 11, 2021",1,Shocking lockdown returns policy stains an otherwise faultless record of 10 years of customer service,"I have been a loyal customer of ASOS for over 10 years, placing orders with them as frequently as once a week. I have been an ardent supporter of the brand and have always recommended them whenever possible for their excellent customer service and (apparently) high morals for a business of their size. ASOS advertise their returns policy as 28 days for refunds and up to 45 days for a return via gift voucher. During the first national lockdown, they extended this to 90 days. Sadly, it seems they have retrospectively reversed this policy for this current lockdown, and have inexplicably changed this timeframe back to 28 days, quashing the 45 day offer entirely. This change was not advertised; when questioned as to why not, it seems ASOS expect you to read their returns policy like the morning paper, lest you miss such salient changes.With my local collection office closed for the duration of lockdown, and with no means of getting to another one, I was told by ASOS today that I will not be able to return my items for a giftcard as I was 2 days out of the return period. I was also advised I will not be able to escalate my query (they have no complaints process and allegedly each customer service rep is trained to the same standard of a manager, so they will refuse to put you through to one) and they would not make any exceptions. For a company I have shopped with for so long, I am so disappointed that they seem to be the exception in so many online retailers adapting their return policies in line with the restrictions faced by their customers. I would have thought they be spearheading customer satisfaction during this time, and acting as the example for other retailers as they have in many other regards. Disheartening - I will be closing my account with them today. (My customer care agent Stevie was most helpful within the limits of their duties, the decision clearly not being theirs)"

The delivery address was the same as it has always been and there was always someone at home to receive the order so I don’t understand why.I asked if ASOS could contact the courier to find out why and they refused, I asked if asos could provide me with a contact number so I can chase and they couldn’t- the only resolution was a refund which didn’t resolve my concern that this won’t happen again in the future, and it was frustrating that I had lost out on the next day delivery I’d paid for. Also the order was a gift which was now no longer available to reorder/and I had to explain to the gift recipient that her gift couldn’t be delivered. However, I agreed to a refund as there was no other option. 7days later and I see I was only refunded for part of the order - again I had to chase with ASOS and the explanation I received was ‘there may have been a glitch to the system’ as the refund was not processed. I was advised to wait an additional 13days on top of the 7. If I had not chased the error in the refund I may not have received any.Appalling service from ASOS as I seem to have lost out on several things here with no sufficient explanation."

Unfortunately in the time I had waited every single item i had bought had sold out, asos did not apoligise. I then made another purchase 2 weeks ago. again the package was late with no tracking info. I contacted asos they told me again to wait. In the time I was waiting I received an email saying that they had returned my order and that I had been refunded, however I never received my order. This is twice in a row my parcel has got lost and hasn’t made its way to me. I have been a loyal customer of asos for longer that 5 years and both orders I had placed were not cheap.

"February 11, 2021",1,Unbelievable,"Unbelievable. I order from Asos, the order doesn't show up in my account which is annoying as I want to return the items. I just spent 30 mins on the chat only to be told ' I can't help you now as you keep providing me with different information'.  What !!??I provided everything asked. Now I have to go through a whole big process to prove my identity and purchase.Seriously, this is not cool."

"February 11, 2021",1,Nike Dunks out of stock before drop,"I woke up early this morning to try to get my hands on some new nike dunk colorways that were supposed to release at 9am GMT today. Last time Asos released dunks, they also did not stick to the schedule and dropped the night before (around 2am i believe), making it impossible to get except for bots of course. This time they dropped about 2 hours before the actual drop time, again making it impossible to buy for real users. I am very upset about this because Asos is marketing these dunks a lot, attracting sneakerheads to their instagram and website. Then proceeding to not even drop the shoes at the mentioned time, this is just so infuriating. Either drop at correct time, do a raffle (where you have to authorize paypal to prevent bots) or just dont sell the shoes lol."

ASOS provides with a huge range of clothes, differing from brand to brand, and including sizes for different types of bodies, such as Plus sized. Moreover, ASOS tends to have plenty of sales, and sometimes even code discounts over sales. The only things that I have seen degrading over time is the amount of time deliveries take to arrive, especially with the arrival of Covid-19, and the other thing is getting refunded for deliveries, which I have ended up always having to contact customer service to get my refund back. Despite this, I am happy to recommend ASOS."

They also told me that there not emailing customers anymore to use the chat when that is not even available. They told me my order had no tracking number so they cannot track it ??? It’s still in Germany and hasn’t even been shipped yet. I would never buy from here ever DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE !!!

I am paying for a premium service with next day delivery and now not receiving it. It’s been over a week now and still no idea what’s happening with my order. Half the items are now out of stock, you still have my £130 and I still can’t get a straight answer from your customer service. It’s not that hard to say there is an issue and we need to cancel and then I receive an email stating that and that you are processing my refund. But obviously that’s too much for your staff and systems to handle."

"February 11, 2021",5,Great customer service from ASOS,"I had the situation of a complicated return with ASOS as there were items outstanding from before Xmas and then once I had packaged stuff up I found another item and I had gone over the returns time limit as my whole family had corona and had been self-isolating. I must say I was really impressed with ASOS - whether I was communicating via email or live chat, they were prompt and understanding and really helped a lot. Dominic was really impressive, as was Jerome a couple of days before."

I was advised to reorder and pay extra for delivery and wait for a refund. No thank you.  The customer service people on the chat are rude and unhelpful. They will say anything to get you to go away
"February 11, 2021",2,Unnecessarily long process,"My Parcel never arrived. It took a whole month for them to accept that it was lost, despite it saying so on Hermes' tracking app. Even after they agreed that I was due a refund I still didn't receive one until I complained.

I notified ASOS of the error on the day of placing the order and was told the item can not be sent to another address. I was told just to wait forThe parcel to be returned so I would get my money back or go and pick it up if it states delivered (during a national lockdown).I repeatedly explained I understand it’s an error but I do not want to cancel the item I just want it delivered to me.I was then told to order it on BNPL through klarna so I could get the item.This is a first time in a while I have used ASOS and will never be using them again. A simple request due to an error I was asking to be amended and was given resolutions that had no common sense applied!

I then was told hermes could of lost the parcel so i will be sent an email with an update. The customer service assistant also offered me compensation on top of me getting my refund back. I was then sent an email and replied, however nobody ever got back to me. Surprise suprise i had to do the chasing again. I was told that my issue would be sorted out today when it want. I have been told different things by different people which is very annoying and frustrating. This is not how customer service works the service that i received is abysmal. Furthermore more today on the 11th almost a month since i made the order was told i have to wait 5 days to receive an email with a refund and an asos voucher code. Another 5 days is an absolute joke for an issue that is out of my hand. I was also told that asos don't even offer compensation. Could somebody please let me know why i was told i could have it? I would like to speak to a manager if ever possible because this is just rude disgusting and poor for asos."
"February 11, 2021",5,Responsive and able to resolve the issue,ASOS customer care staff always respond promptly to queries and do their best to resolve them for you. On occasions where I have had an issue with a refund I have always managed to speak to someone who has resolved this for me. I spoke with Antony over the live chat today and he resolved an issue regarding a return for me.

Premier delivery is brilliant and so quick (often less than 24 hours later i have my order, great when you need something last minute!) and returns are quick and easy. Had my first issue today when a sports bra arrived slightly stained from someone previously trying it on, but I’d bought it was a discount code that has now ended so didn’t want to return and pay full price. Chatted online to the most helpful colleague who got me a replacement sent straight out! So quick and lovely to deal with. Fab work ASOS!"

"February 11, 2021",3,Frustrated with online chat,I returned stuff on 23 Dec and had heard nothing. On my third attempt my issue got resolved but it took ages. Not being able to speak to a human is frustrating. The online chat can only accept screenshots which is also frustrating as emails or pdfs etc cannot be uploaded as evidence of postage etc. Generally in terms of getting deliveries etc generally I find ASOS excellent.
"February 11, 2021",3,Birthday Promo Code Not Working,Downside is it took one hour before I received contact in the ASOS live chat.I contacted ASOS customer care as the birthday code sent to me offering 10% off wasn’t working. Positive is that Kenneth in customer care live chat was brilliant in dealing with my query and explained discount codes don’t work on sale items.  When ASOS emails promo codes to customers it would be helpful if ASOS indicates whether codes are valid on full price or discounted items as by the time I got through to customer service and the query was resolved the key item in my basket is now out of stock in size 10😟
"February 11, 2021",5,Very helpful😍,Very helpful😍. I've chatted for a refund because my parcel have been destroyed. And they immediately work for it and I've received an email that they will refund my money. I'm waiting and can't wait to repurchase.
"February 11, 2021",1,I ordered two dresses a couple weeks…,"I ordered two dresses a couple weeks ago and was sent one dress and one toothbrush that I didn’t order. I immediately messaged ASOS on Facebook and was told by one person they would send me a new dress and then a different person replied, apologized, and said I would need to send the $5 toothbrush back before they would refund me for the $20 dress I ordered. So I reordered the dress because it was on sale and a lot of sizes had sold out. I just received my order today and again I received a toothbrush instead of the dress. I spoke with Antoinit via chat. They were very unhelpful and unapologetic. I then spoke with Erica via Facebook and while she was very friendly, helpful, and sympathetic, she gave me the same instructions as before; to return the toothbrush before I would get refunded. I still haven’t received my first refund and I am very frustrated with the customer service. I have ordered from ASOS for several years now and have always had great service but sadly I don’t think I will be shopping with ASOS any longer."

"February 11, 2021",1,No Longer Buying from ASOS,I’m a very loyal customer to ASOS and I was very happy with the products and delivery BUT NO MORE. I am struggling with your customer service and was asking them for a real help to resolve my hanging not delivered shipments (4 orders currently delayed and another one expected on 14/2/2021 but I’m sure it will not arrive). This is why I will stop buying from your site as your customer service agent sent me a non-professional email that they are happy with their service as if they are helping!!! instead of resolving my issue as if ASOS is not responsible for shipment after they are shipped!!!

"February 11, 2021",2,What’s going on?,Placed an order on January 10th - Delivery status from Hermes states with courier on January 12th. Still not received parcel.

"February 11, 2021",3,Bershka flare jeans are terrible!,"ASOS itself is always great, but the Bershka flare jeans in black are so bad on sizing, it was worth leaving a review. Normally I'm AU size 8-10 and I originally bought a 10, and they literally fit like a 6. I couldn't even get it up my leg, no stretch. I went ahead and returned and bought a 12 and a 14, and both jeans fit like an 8. They fit, just, but weren't high-waisted at all and had almost zero stretch. I normally love Bershka, but these fell flat sadly. Just a warning to anyone, if you want to risk it, I sized up 2-3 sizes and they were still skin tight."

"February 11, 2021",1,Promo code glitch,"There was some sort of glitch when I tried to enter a promo code that my order was eligible for. I reported it right away and it took ASOS over 24 hours to get back to me. They had clearly not read my email and just sent some sort of automated response, because they didn't address the correct issue at all. I reiterated the issue, and the team refused to acknowledge that there was most likely some technological glitch on their end. They barely investigated the issue and then did nothing to resolve the matter or figure out a solution. As a customer who spends quite a bit of money at ASOS, I would have expected much better service."

"February 11, 2021",1,I’m so disappointed with ordering from…,I’m so disappointed with ordering from ASOS! I placed an order in January and were supposed to receive it by February 1st. After many times following up they told me that my order has been lost on February 10th and they can issue me a refund! I needed the dresses for my maternity photoshoot which I never get a chance to do. I’m so upset and never order from them again! Not recommended at all.
"February 11, 2021",1,Disappointing Experience,"I am very disappointed in my experience with ASOS - the communication, customer service and professionalism was appalling. My order was placed last Friday on 05.01.2021 and my order confirmation was emailed to me. I did not receive any further communication regarding the order, so I checked my app which said the order was cancelled on Monday. I was not notified by the app nor was I emailed, so I was unaware until I checked almost 1 week later. I spoke to 2 people by the chat function which took almost 1 hour. The first advisor I spoke to did not reply after I told her my issue so I spent 20 minutes waiting for her. The second advisor gave me the wrong information multiple times - she told me my order was not cancelled and was being processed and assured me that it would arrive by 17.01.2021 which is was incorrect as it had been cancelled. She also said that my items were in stock and that they I can simply reorder - which was incorrect aswell as 2 of the 3 items were not in stock. The items were for a birthday gift and now I have to wait for a discount code to come in my email (which she said takes 24 hours to generate) as well as wait for shipping. I would not recommend ASOS to anyone else based on my recent experience."
"February 10, 2021",1,I very much enjoy ASOS and I do not…,"I very much enjoy ASOS and I do not think this is anyone's fault from a representative standpoint. I believe they do their best with the tools they are given. However I do not think they are given enough tools. I was told three days in a row that an answer regarding an order was yet to be resolved and to come back the next day. It would be much easier if I could call and speak to a person. Also, when I requested a call I did not receive one even though your website says that a call can be requested if they think that's the best way to resolve an issue. I just felt as though there was nothing that could be done by myself or your staff and I was merely requested to wait for a solution."
"February 10, 2021",1,Misinformation,"I was provided with an option to have my parcel delivered to the nearest UPS store. Upon my item being delivered, I was informed by UPS that I needed to pay a $10 fee just to pick up my package. I was not notified of this fee whatsoever, neither by ASOS nor by UPS. I contacted ASOS to see if I was able to get reimbursed or even receive a voucher at all to offset the price but was told that they cannot help me. Now, that being said, $10 isn’t much, but it’s more so the respect of it all. If ASOS is working with UPS, they should advise their customers for any fee’s that may be related to shipping rather than have us unexpectedly be charged with it. Usually, you make an order, pay the shipping and taxes, receive your order and be done with it. Having to pay an extra charge just to pick up your order can quite literally ruin your day. I am not pleased one bit!"

"February 10, 2021",1,Free returns or loose your money and the ordered items,"Do not rely on Asos ""free"" return option. If items do not reach Asos for any reason, they won't be able to track them even though you used their return slip with the barcode. So you will loose the items that you wanted to return and they won't refund you if by accident you loose the tiny piece of paper that Asos collection point issued you as a proof of return. -200 EUR for me and I will definitely never buy anything from Asos again."

That is what you call appalling service, to go back on your word and the worst thing is if there are hairs on the trousers, it’s someone else’s refund or someone has handled it and we’re in the middle of a pandemic."

"February 10, 2021",1,I am so disappointed in Asos.,"I am so disappointed in Asos.I placed an order this morning at around 10.30am-definitely before any cut off point, and paid over €10 for Next Day delivery (I have consistently used this feature without any issues) I then looked at the date today vs my delivery date and it specifies delivery for Fri 12th not the 11th as it should be. Aside from not having any clarification as to why I won't be receiving my order 'Next Day' (as advertised and stated) I have also paid the extortionate amount for a service not even being carried out. This was not a late afternoon or evening order, it was placed well before cut off point and it cost a lot of money. Customer service were unhelpful and uninterested, ignoring my points and directing me here as the only way to complain. Annoyingly, up until this day Asos have always rated as 5* for me, always loved the service and products etc but I'm annoyed at having paid a premium price for an average delivery + feeling like it's false advertising as nowhere on the Asos website does it state that Next Day, doesn't actually mean next day... (this is what the customer agent said to me) As this seems the only option for complaint, I would appreciate being contacted to resolve this issue please."

"February 10, 2021",1,Bad customer service,"Lately, it has not been a customer service team I am happy to contact because I know I won't get very good help.I placed an order and it was split into two parcels. I received notification that one was to be delivered, and received it. Then the same evening I received a notification that I had returned all bar 1 of the undelivered items. I then contacted customer service on email to ask for clarification as I had not received anything to be able to refund (and no one had attempted to deliver anything either - I'm home all the time these days). No response was received except a useless holding email. I then received an email telling me my parcel had been sent to the delivery provider, so I was hopeful that it would actually be coming. Nothing happened, provider says they are 'waiting to receive parcel' (this happened last year and the parcel eventually arrived after 3+ weeks).. and then I receive an email asking me to rate my purchases... which I never received!I then gave up and contacted customer service again to be told nothing could be done, the warehouse had received a return - despite nothing having been sent to me. And that I should just reorder - never mind that things were in the sale or perhaps now no longer in stock (of which there were 3). This is not the first time there have been problems on  my orders via the warehouse, and this is not a very helpful response 'just go and order them again if you really want them'. Not an offer to help reorder, not an offer to help if things weren't on discount still so I would pay the same price. Not an offer of anything. Just shrugging off the error as though it wasn't ASOS' mistake. Overall - just unhappy with the consistantly poor customer service experience with ASOS lately."

"February 10, 2021",1,Unable to Help with their own Process,Unable to help cancel a return mailing label that was paid for when it says right on the website that the retailer must contact REBOUND to cancel. Not to mention that this is a return process outlined by ASOS and not of my own making.
"February 10, 2021",1,I will not use ASOS again until I am treated correctly,I am extremely angry with the company. I use ASOS on a very regular basis but I will now not use again. I brought a pair of “chunky sole” shoes after wearing them twice the frount of the sole collapsed Which was very painful as it pinched my foot. I then spoke to customer service via Facebook who seemed to be quite helpful and told me to return them as they are faulty. I got the qr code to return the faulty items on the 27th December on the 28th my dad got covid so I couldn’t leave the house for 10 days on the 4th my mum got covid another 10 days in I then got covid in the 9th was in hospital for two weeks. As soon as I could leave the house after recovering I posted my faulty items. Once the wear house received them they got rejected as they had been work but I had already told customer service they had been work twice so the factory should have known this. I then spoke to customer service again who obviously couldn’t be bothered to read the message I had sent them. Customer services were absolutely useless and no help whatsoever and told me I should have returned them sooner. Company’s should be more understanding that in these hard times people can’t just go out just to return a parcel. I will be seeking a way to take this further.

No way of cancelling the return on the app so then spoke to an ASOS team member in the chat function. They said they could not help and I needed to contact collect plus. It would be much easier for the customer if we could cancel a return in the app or if ASOS could do this.
"February 10, 2021",5,Tnx Lauren,Even though this whole return process turned into nightmare I would like to say that Lauren was the only one who was actually reading what I was writing on a chat and tried to help me.

My only problem is that it seems to take longer for packages to arrive here in ASIA (Philippines) I guess choosing the premium shipping really pays dividends, but it takes out the “cheaper here” factor that ASOS provides.

"February 10, 2021",1,Disappointed and frustrated,"I placed an order for two different Northface neck gaiters (a Denali $30 and a Windwall one $40). I ended up receiving two of the Denali neck gaiters. I contacted ASOS customer service to advise them of this error and to seek resolution. The rep advised to return the incorrect item and place an order for the correct item as per normal order. The correct item turned out to be out of stock. Frustrated, I told the rep that I was willing to keep the incorrect item since I needed two gaiters anyway. The only thing I requested was a refund in the difference in price be credited back to me ($10). They kept insisting that the item had to be returned for inventory purposes and to reorder per usual if I still needed the item. I even provided photo evidence to show that I did indeed receive the incorrect item. Despite reviewing this, I was still advised that they must have the incorrect item returned. I am baffled at how the system can be so antiquated. Rather than making a simple inventory adjustment and then investigating internally, it is preferred to inconvenience the customer to return the item, essentially to receive the same item back after reordering. I asked if there was any other way to resolve this and whether the issue could be escalated to a manager, but there was no effort in doing so. I strongly recommend this process be reviewed as it is inefficient and lacks customer focus. It ruins the shopping experience and deters my desire to place future orders with ASOS."

"February 09, 2021",1,Trouble returning an item from Topman,"I’m having trouble returning an item I bought from Topman. The website redirect to ASOS links me back to the Topman ‘returns’ information page which hasn’t been updated to reflect the merge as it tell you to log into your Topman account. Which you can’t as the website is no longer running. I’ve emailed ASOS customer service with no reply in three days but a generic autoreply. So then I decided to go on the online chat, which was absolutely useless. The responses were generic and pre-generated. It seemed like ‘team member’ didn’t read my initial responses, only took the general details then send me an automated response. The Topman website doesn’t have up to date information and if I try to generate a return form their returns portal it can’t find my order. This back and forward process from Topman to ASOS to Topman is draining and frustrating. This is on top of the goods arriving almost a month after I purchased them. I understand covid has a lot to do with that but there’s no excuse for bad customer service on the returns end... I just want a solution, not to be redirected one thousand and one times."
"February 09, 2021",1,Sent The Wrong Vans...TWICE,"I ordered a pair of Vans slip on shoes, and was sent the wrong ones TWICE! The first time I was sent the incorrect color in the correct women’s size, so I returned them like I was told by an automated email,  and re-ordered them. The second time I was sent the correct color, but in a men’s size which are obviously way too big. I ordered what I thought were size US 8.5 women’s, but got an US 8.5 men’s which are size 10 in women’s. Customer service, either via email or chat basically tells you in a scripted way to return and re-order. So I asked if I order them in the men’s size that is compatible with the women’s size will they actually be a men’s or women’s size that are sent to me...seems like I couldn’t get an answer and it’s going to be a surprise as to whether you get the correct size. The gender filter on the search engine meant nothing. So now my card has been debited twice while still waiting for the first refund, and I have a 2nd pair to return. Updating the sizes with the correct gender/sizes would save a lot of hassle for all. Disappointed."

Then when I went to inquire as to where the rest of my shirts were from my order, they told me it had all been delivered. I then called the shipping company who told me they dropped off only one shirt. After spending well over an hour in the customer chat, I was then told that the rest of my order was coming within the next few days.2 weeks later, didn't receive my order...finally received it and now I owe another $70 in shipping, when I was told I would not see another shipment cost, as they would cover it...due to the previous mix up.What's even worse is -you can't speak to anyone over the phone, they are getting rid of their email communication so really what you are left with is a chat box. Overall the people in the chat box, while polite and doing their best...nothing was resolved and I am left to feel quite frustrated and taken advantage ofI wish I could take back my decision to shop with this company, because I would do it in a heart beat.It is also safe to say this was my first and last time ordering from this company"

Refused help when I couldn’t access the website to use a discount code that has now expired.Accused me of lying, despite the fact I caught her out in a lie.Wouldn’t answer the majority of my questions and the few she did were prewritten jargon that made little sense to my questions.Some of what she wrote was illegible and still makes little sense.Half way through the convo she acted like she was going to honour the 20%, but then said she couldn’t because I hadn’t placed an order using the discount code... at this point she hadn’t been reading the conversation properly because the whole point was I could only get on the website just before the conversation started and the discount was expired. So, how could I have placed the order with the discount code? Also, if I had managed to place the order with a discount code then I wouldn’t need to contact anyone. She literally laid out a bunch of impossible conditions for me to meet.She told me to complain via this link and that a manager would see it. She also stated that she was trained to deal with anything a manager could deal with, including a complaint against herself. Well, you heard it here Asos, this one person can do the job of all the managers, so why have any managers at all?She suddenly ended the conversation whilst I was waiting for a reply to a question. So, that really says it all about the level of service going on!Good to know ASOS look after their customers as well as a dog would look after a bone..."

Their solution when contacted was basically noting.  No apology, no item replacement, they fixed nothing.  It was all my responsibility to deal with their mistake.  Told me to send the items back and wait for a refund... this will take two weeks+ and I do not have money to purchase replacements for the faulty items.  I've literally had better service from budget brands like shein (where you expect to have bad service).  Asos really disappointed, definitely done ordering from them."

No email bar one to say they were aware of an issue, so I rang on the Tuesday. Person I spoke to informed me that my issue had been sent to the wrong team, and would be in the queue to speak to the right team but it would be several days. Was very rude, raised there voice and constantly interrupted me. I’m awaiting a call back from the manager and awaiting contact from the ‘correct’ team.

Then said I had to manually re do the order myself. Which I did. Then the new order is stuck in the same status as the old one. Everytime I speak to chat they're unhelpful because they can't look into anything case by case. Used to love ASOS but they haven't got a clue anymore now they're asking me to review clothes I've never received and I'm not sure I'm going to get my interview clothes by Friday which is why I ordered in the first place. Until they get a UK team that have a fast response they've lost my trade entirely.

"February 09, 2021",1,Krystal from customer service blatantly ignored my support request and gave me zero help.,I reached out to Asos with the hopes that they would help me with a package that never arrived from Topman (who I reached out to for weeks on end) after Topman told me I would need to go through Asos for help since the acquisition. I have been forced into a back-and-forth between Topman and Asos and both companies just keep referring me to the other with no one offering to help with the package or issue a refund. When I received my response from Krystal (who clearly didn't read my claim) they simply just said to go back to Topman for help. This is the worst customer service I have experienced in MY LIFE. I will NEVER shop at Asos again and will spread the word about this non-existent customer service.

Also their follow up emails are completely irrelevant to preceding correspondence. I returned an order in October 2020. I forgot about it until I received an email from ASOS in January 2021 confirming that a refund was processed for returned items. Obviously so much delay!!! Then I checked my account last week in February 2021 and the refund was not  there. I hopped on chat and asked about my refund. The response was that they have given me a voucher instead of refund because the items were returned after 30 days!!! No, the items were returned within 3 weeks. My mistake was that I threw away the return parcel docket after ASOS confirmed in January that they are going to refund me. I have told them about it. I asked them to explain why they processed the return in 2021. No answer. I requested to get a manager to contact me. Nope, the customer service can't escalate any issues to management level of support. I finally received an email from ASOS asking me to add my credit card details to my account so that they can process the refund. Finally. Yay. I added my credit card. But no! They did not process any refund. A second email came through the next day. It is a repeat of the response I had received from the robot-like customer service team members. This is such a ridiculous process that they have for complaint. Not going to buy anything else from ASOS anymore."

"February 09, 2021",1,Unacceptable service,"I ordered an item as a leaving present for a colleague as I knew she had been wanting this bag for a while. It was out of the price range we had but thankfully due to a discount code available we were able to get it. The item was sent out with Hermes (god knows why anyone uses this courier) but it never arrived. While I was sat waiting for the item I got a notification stating they were unable to deliver - strange as I was in, so I checked the security cameras to see if I had just not heard them! Nothing, no one had been. We are a business that is closed to the public at the min but receive deliveries daily. They stated they would attempt in 24 hours. This time I got a notification stating it had been delayed and the same the following 3 days. ASOS spoke to them and suggested I give it 48 hrs - 4 days later I find out it’s in its way back to ASOS. By this point the bag is now out of stock. I have just spent 40 mins trying to see if when ASOS receive the parcel can they resend it to me? No was the answer!Ok there is one alternative, please can you validate the discount code I used on my purchase so I can get a different bag? No! Can I speak to a member of management? No! For a company as big as ASOS I would have expected the very least they could have done would be to validate the code. Or deal with a customer that has placed regular orders and spent a lot of money with the company in an acceptable way. This is not the first issue I have had but today I found the lack of being able to deal with a minor situation astounding.Gone are the days of real customer service. Now it’s automated responses with no “real” people to speak with!"

My order was never delivered and the courier company lost it. But I had to email ASOS and was asked to contact them again in 48hrs to get a update. This makes you feel undervalued why do I have to chase them for updates. I asked 3 times to make a complaint but I was never given the details of how to do this.

I used to shop a lot with ASOS because I felt secure as a customer - no longer.  Perhaps it's the competition out there, but the onus is now on you to keep pursuing them.  I get the feeling they hope you will give up, which makes me even more irritated by their appallingly incompetent customer service.  Incompetence is one thing, deliberate incompetence is another."

Some time after they declared that my parcel was lost. Great. I got in touch with ASOS customer service in December asking to resend my orders. They took more than 3 days to re-investigate but in the end agreed the parcel was lost and they will resend another. On 28th of Dec, they messaged me to say the parcel was ‘refused’ and was back to the warehouse and they’ll refund. I was confused because my partner and I was home all day on that day and my doorbell didn’t ring/ I didn’t receive a card to say they missed us.  Anyway, they promised to refund when the parcel returns to the warehouse. It has been over 1 month. No refund. I emailed and emailed. Only to have to explain my situations over and over again. Today, I emailed again with previous emails attached and they processed my refund which will take another 10 working days. I wasted my time and didn’t see my orders or money since the end of November last year. I’m writing this trust pilot review because the CS agent had the audacity to ask me to leave a feedback. At least they should have been aware that I haven’t had the best experience and that perhaps I will not give them 5 stars?Please delete my account."

"February 09, 2021",1,Awful customer service.,Took an hour for the advisor to understand my issue despite me explaining it over and over again. Kept trying to tell me I was wrong despite knowing I wasn’t. Once the advisor finally understood the issue was resolved but it took way to long and if I had listened to him at the start I wouldn’t have gotten my money back!

I had beeen back and forth with ASOS about a missing item in my order, trying to avoid paying for the item again plus shipping and no discount code (all because someone forgot my item).

Thank you Nova!"

"February 09, 2021",1,Typical ASOS customer service.,Topman has been acquired by ASOS. I can't access my account or see the location of my parcel. ASOS can't assist me with anything. The typical half-ass customer service brought to you by a European brand.
"February 09, 2021",5,"John and Celine were super helpful and quick, but awful delivery","John and Celine were super helpful and quick - it's been a pleasure speaking with them and they really helped me.Nevertheless, the delivery courier is the worst (CitySprint) - I was at home at all times and they stated that there was no answer, not once, but twice. Of course I was home, there is a national lockdown! I don't recommend using their services,"
"February 09, 2021",5,Jerome - massive thumbs up!,"Jerome was awesome to deal with. There was no way to fix my problem but he was lovely, honest and kind about it.

"February 09, 2021",1,Long long long time customer of ASOS,"Long long long time customer of ASOS. I had to return an item before Christmas, used the ASOS returns process but no sign of refund. I tracked the item and it had been delivered to ASOS Returns in Ireland. I have had correspondence from 6 different customer care agents, I have produced proof of using the returns portal (email recieved with label) - proof of the tracking and that it was delivered to ASOS Returns c/o Fastway. But no refund.  I have never had any issues with ASOS before, loved them, but this whole experience over a 40 euro dress (when I have spent thousands with them over the years has left me frustrated) I know its not anything to do with the agents- they were all very polite and just following procedure. And no, I am not a person who has loads of returns that ASOS have spotted- in the past four years I returned 3 items. Very frustating. I will not be using ASOS again."

No need to print anything, just take to a drop-off location and get a barcode printed then and there. They confirmed same day that the parcel had been picked up. The refund came through quickly, however one item I'd returned was missing on my refund statement. I chatted with JessaMae from customer service who quick to check the details and issue a refund for the missing item.Would recommend again as most convenient way to shop during the pandemic as they take the stress out of everything."

Which I never even Returned a lot to begin with. Maybe twice! The Customer service is terrible, they don’t value their customers. Most of the shops I shop with are on asos and now I can’t purchase from them, like TOPSHOP etc.  I even purchased premier delivery for a year, I have been a customer for 3+ years, and ordered a lot from this site every month. they didn’t care about helping or reaching a solution, or even telling me why my account was blocked. They told me they will not re open it. It’s appalling! I am very very disappointed and I don’t recommend this company!"
"February 09, 2021",1,ASOS Error Was Not Rectified,"I really liked ASOS, bought a lot and was wanting to buy a lot more. I followed the returns policy, was provided confirmation from a consultant that the credit would be actioned but an error on their part caused me to miss this credit.

I reached out to customer service,to ask for the code or re-do the return request for me. And they FAILED to do so...

"February 09, 2021",1,Very unhappy about paying for shipping TWICE,"I ordered a few clothing items and paid for shipping at the time of my order. When I picked up my order I was then charged by another shipping company that I did not agree to at the time of my order. I reached out to ASOS about the additional shipping charge and they said they do not pay for custom charges (understandable) BUT the post office informed me that it was another shipping company requiring my payment in order to pick up my items, and that it was NOT a customs charge.ASOS has yet to refund me for the additional shipping costs."
"February 09, 2021",1,This company is a joke,"This company is a joke.  They failed to fulfill my order.  They emailed me claiming a ""glitch"" caused the issue and instructed me to reorder but they would not allow me to use my discount code claiming I already used it on the order they failed to fulfill.  Customer service never replied to me and it's pretty obvious their discounts are either fake or a scam.  And you cannot reply to emails they send you.  Shady companies should be called out as such.  You are shady and dishonest and I will never do business with you again."
"February 09, 2021",1,Received an incorrect item from ASOS…,Received an incorrect item from ASOS and wrong size and was penalized by now having to drag myself and newborn to the post office when it was a mistake done by ASOS not myself. I’m so displeased and a new item should’ve been sent to me I shouldn’t have to deal with this. I order online to minimize exposure for myself and my newborn and now I have to stand in a line at the post office and do precisely that.

"February 09, 2021",1,"Worst customer service, they deceive their customers and then don’t answer","Zero help, zero help at all. Just the generic BS answers, deflecting all blame. Telling me to contact your carrier to dispute my handling chargers when I never even transacted with your carrier. I checked out on ASOS and it said free delivery, don’t advertise free delivery if you know your carrier is going to charge handling fees. Unbelievable, can confidently say this is the worst online retail experience I’ve ever had, and it’s a shame because I actually liked the product, but I will never ever shop with you con artists ever again."
"February 09, 2021",1,I ordered an item Neely two weeks ago,"I ordered an item Neely two weeks ago, Hermes have indicated they’ve attempted delivery, however no one arrived an no missed delivery card was placed through my door either. I have been constantly emailing an speaking on live chat to investigate. I was promised by an ASOS colleague that I’d have a replacement sent by today. This still hasn’t turned up an I’m having to wait even longer for further investigations. I’ve taken a lot of time off work to wait around for this delivery also am very unhappy with the customer service."
"February 09, 2021",1,Order delayed.,"Order delayed.Costumer care answer fast, but copy paste answer, no feeling a Metter to your company. No feeling I worth something for you. So my decision Is to never order from you again. Used to love you and always say good things about you. But I guess any succeful company doesn't care from her small client. Wish you well, and maybe care a little bit more from clients. Or that's your way. Computers and robotics contect"

The customer service I’ve received has far surpassed that of any other; not only that but the staff have been personable and welcoming. The chat system is great and have always received efficient, helpful and concise. If clothing companies were boyfriends, ASOS would be marriage material."

"February 08, 2021",1,I live in Canada and I placed 2 ordered…,"I live in Canada and I placed 2 ordered from ASOS for first time not knowing that I will be charged a lot of money extra at the post office (customs duties, sales tax, provincial tax and post fees). I am very disappointed as nowhere it was mentioned when I placed the order. After getting the order I was sadly surprised about so much charge. My complaint to ASOS is it, to write it down at the check out about those charges, so that the customer is informed about extra fees and charges. It was not worth for me at all to buy item from ASOS."
"February 08, 2021",4,Helpful representative,The customer service representative was fantastic and very helpful (Rammel). My query was dealt with and I was reassured. My only criticism is that it took 25 minutes but I am guessing that the representative was probably dealing with a lot of customers at once so I don’t blame them.
"February 08, 2021",1,TERRIBLE customer service,"TERRIBLE customer service, avoid at all cost!!! After waiting for my package for a month and the costumer service deeming my package lost and I should expect a refund in 4 days. Never received notice from the team nor did I receive the refund.I received the package out of the blue after a month, after already purchasing a jacket from another retailer I requested the company to at least refund my shipping fee for returns, in which I was told was not possible and they were not willing to compensate for their employees error. NEVER ordering again and I would suggest everyone to avoid this company."

"February 08, 2021",1,Appalling Customer Service that contradicts Asos own return policy,"I made contact with customer services last week, within the return timeframe requesting an extension to my returns due to having been very ill for almost a month. I have a severe disability and with lockdown restrictions and the need to shield, and sporadic opening times for returns agents, I was unable to return the items when I wanted to, on the day after the return was created with Asos. However, no one responded to me from customer service. I contacted customer service this evening to advise that the items will be returned tomorrow and gave Camilla(?) a true and factual account of why I was a few days outside the return timeframe.  I had read your policy on returning after allocated timeframes and am aware that you look at each individual circumstances. Camilla advised me to return the goods but you be aware that I’m likely not to get refunded. When I enquired about how I would be recompensed eg a credit facility etc she stated that I wouldn’t receive anything for the goods ASOS take back. This is obviously a mistake as they can’t take back almost £200 of unopened goods and leave me with nothing. Camilla refused to allow me to speak to her manager even after 4-5 times requesting this. Surely asos aren’t capitalising on covid restrictions, lockdowns and ill health to make money off their customer?!? I’m so disappointed in the standoff I received tonight from this customer service advisor. Even after I thanked her and was about to close the conversation, she changed her mind ob the advice she advised at the beginning;- write a note outline what occurred to I won’t receive anything from Asos which makes me think the deciding manager hadnt the nerve to pass on his own false information"
"February 08, 2021",1,Worst customer service ever,Worst customer service ever. I put in the correct address for a delivery. 1st parcel arrived with no issues but the 2nd parcel got delivered to the wrong state!ASOS would not give me a refund because they stated it was an issue with the carrier and I need to remediate the issue through them.ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?!
"February 08, 2021",5,"Brilliant, quick service","John and Dominic were both incredibly helpful. There had been an issue with my return, which they dealt with very swiftly and politely, really putting my mind at ease. Highly recommended."
"February 08, 2021",1,Charged more for a replacement item,"I love ASOS it’s a great company, it’s only going to go from strength to strength. But I’ve just had a bad experience after receiving a damaged item which I sent back, then got charged more money to buy a replacement. This wouldn’t happen at any other retailer, I’m really disappointed at ASOS the whole process has been a shambles. I look forward to your response"
"February 08, 2021",1,Late from the estimated delivery date,"My estimated delivery was on 11.02.2021, but the date was changed after I confirmed my order and became 15.02.2021. On this date the order isn’t necessary for me anymore, as I have an occasion on 13.02.2021 and do not have a dress to wear. Moreover I paid 22 dollars for express delivery."

"February 08, 2021",1,Shipping Nightmare!,"I bought a coat. I returned a coat. I was refunded for the coat. So I bought the same coat, in a different size. (Because doing an exchange would be just too easy for you all!) I got a blazer (?) instead. I go to re-re-order the coat. It's out of stock. I order a completely different coat. Coat says it's shipped, delivered - but never arrives. After 3 customer service chats where I have to explain this saga, asked to send over pictures, AND instructed to call ""a post office"" in NYC to make sure they did their jobs, (spoiler alert: they were pissed, and said they've been focusing their time getting covid vaccines out) I have to practically beg for a refund. This experience has lasted me over 2 months, and has stressed out my sweet mom who isn't that great with technology. And for what? A 10% off discount for an order I guarantee you I won't be placing."

Within 5 minutes through the instant chat service, my issue was solved. Very efficient and helpful customer service, who are kind and patient dealing with customer inquiries. Really satisfied."
"February 08, 2021",1,I am absolutely appalled with the level…,"I am absolutely appalled with the level of customer service. I ordered some clothing at the start of Jan and the order went missing, it has taken 4 weeks and for me to chase them on 4 separate occasions to get a refund processed and to be fair I am still sceptical that this is going to happen, I still think I will need to get back in touch. I genuinely didn’t think a company of this size and reputation would act in such a manner especially as this is all down to their delivery service Hermes! Terrible service"
"February 08, 2021",1,"""We REALLY don't want to talk to you""","That's the message that's received when working with ASOS. They go out of their way to make it impossible for you to reach a real person. They offer so many avenues to reach customer support so they can put some kind of automated response at the end of each one. You message them on facebook, and get nothing but a wall of generic filler text. My order was supposed to arrive today but hasn't had the tracking data updated even ONCE. It's so extremely obvious that it got lost in the mail, but ASOS is too desperate to steal its customers money and avoid accountabiltiy that they won't let me report this. To top it all off, their policy states they make you wait THIRTY (30) days after the delivery date to refund you if it still hasn't arrived. What a joke."
"February 08, 2021",1,Disappointed…,"As a first time customer who was eager and excited about the array of products and great prices I was really disappointed that my first order and reshipment was unable to be delivered due to being “lost” in the warehouse. I had placed a second order that also encountered the same issue. 3/3 orders none of which could be delivered. I’m thankful that the customer support team were patient and happy to provide whatever information they could and help me process a refund. Such a shame, I really thought this would be my new go to for online retail."

"February 08, 2021",5,An idea that would help ASOS during pandemic :),"Hello, customer here since 2015!as Nikko an employee at ASOS was helping me with an item i got in the wrong size, i was told that ASOS currently doesn't offer exchange but a return instead. i came up with an idea that would help ASOS especially during the pandemic. the the idea, instead of when a customer wants to return the item, and wait for it to be refunded to his bank account, which takes too long, it should be after confirming the item is being returned you get store credits instead for your next purchase as a discount when you order something. this would really be beneficial especially during the pandemic when everything is slow. thank you so much for reading, and thanks Nikko for great assistance and being intuitive!"

"February 08, 2021",1,Huge Headache Import Duties and Taxes to Canada,"I did not receive any guidance for the issue I was inquiring about. The agent kept asking me why I returned the item which was irrelevant. Ordering from ASOS to Canada is easy, and even the return process is easy enough - but to have to jump through hoops to get any kind of guidance about reimbursement on large import duties and taxes paid on now returned items is a huge headache. CBSA are not much help either and it says on the ASOS/Landmark websites to contact them regarding this. I am now out over $$$ in duties and taxes for items I no longer have. annoying."

"February 08, 2021",4,"The customer service was lovely, order experience not so much","The customer service person was lovely. I am mostly just frustrated because we discovered that although I saw my order was split into 2 parcels, one of which never was delivered, she only saw one parcel that was delivered on her end. Now that there was this discrepancy, she offered to replace the first item that wasn’t delivered, but could only offer a refund for the second top because it was no longer in stock. This is a shame because this was my first experience purchasing from ASOS, and I’m now afraid my future orders may get lost too. The person that helped me was very helpful, but now I may not end up with one or two of the three items I purchased."

"February 08, 2021",1,Poor customer service,"I have had poor care both on email and online chat. I was offered a 20% code as a gift for choosing no hurry delivery at Christmas. I didnt realize it had an expiry date but the first lady i spoke to updated it for me so i wouldnt loose my reward. I ordered a £110 pair of trainers but they did not fit so i sent them back and tried to order another pair but nobody will re send me a new code number. so my gift of 20% off has never been used by me but they say basically that they dont care. Therefore i will now order from another company, and as i have a family of five and and have only recently began online shopping i will let other companies have my hard earned money."

"February 08, 2021",1,Blind leading the blind,"I needed a parcel for a funeral and had been sent an email to say it was on its way. Estimated delivery date came and went, so I contacted the courier for more help. Courier told me to go to ASOS, which I did. I was told they didn’t know whether they had even sent the parcel or not (unsure how this is possible, unless the fairies deliver parcels for ASOS) I was given no answers to my questions, was on the chat for over an hour and went around in circles. I was told the courier needed two days since ASOS had sent the parcel for my tracking information to be updated, and when I told the operator I had already waited three days since this had happened with no update, it quite simply fell on deaf ears. I am now left without an outfit for my dad’s funeral, I have made ASOS aware of this situation and had no empathy, no efforts to ensure my parcel is with me on time despite this. After having reached out to the customer service team I am now left completely in the dark and told to waste more time waiting. The irony is amazing, I even asked the operator to refer me to the complaints team THREE times, and she couldn’t even do that for me! Unhappy is an understatement."
"February 08, 2021",1,Lack of communication and stock availability,"Ordered something on 31.01.2021 and did not receive even though I payed for next day delivery. Contacted someone to tell them and ask where it was, and they informed me I would be getting a replacement and should hear within 24 hours. I had waited 4 days and still not heard anything so emailed again to ask where it was to be told they could not send me my delivery. Issued a refund without telling me too. I’m disappointed and often order off asos."

Not sure what I expected from a fast fashion monstrosity like them but their customer service is truly the worst I have ever had the misfortune to experience in my entire life. You simply cannot talk to a human being. Only bots which do not read messages or understand what you are saying. Each time you try again it does not register anything you’ve previously explained so need to waste your time and try and explain the whole problem again. It has been SIX WEEKS I’ve been trying to resolve an issue and I am nowhere near it. Avoid like the plague. Want to further this complaint so I better receive a follow up

I asked a question about US delivery, to which she responded about UK restrictions. I then asked the question again in a slightly different way, to which she responded with another generic message about restrictions and Irish legislation. I asked her why the items were a) listed for sale on the Irish website when they couldn't be delivered here and b) why I couldn't get them delivered to a US address, which she ignored both of them. I do get a feeling that this is not really her fault, but more so the generic answers which ASOS has told her to use"

It wasn’t until hours later that someone responded, but was no help and didn’t offer a solution to my issue. They also didn’t offer a discount code for me to use on a future purchase on the ASOS website as a way to keep me as a customer. I also don’t like that there’s no phone number to call and speak to anyone. Just some random person doesn’t even reply quickly to solve the problem. This is my second issue with ASOS in less than 6 months and I’m now likely to  take my money somewhere else."
"February 08, 2021",4,Go to Twitter for assistance,"Got what I needed - a new returns label. Asos DM help on Twitter was great, however the chat function on the website is awful.

No further details. I checked my local post office ever 2 days to see if it has been given to them, and nothing the whole time.... your shipping is poor and need to be improved. there was no calling card left in a mine or my neighbour who is 18a Shortt Street and I was home the entire day there was an apparent delivery attempt"

I proved it to asos with photos and they sent me a replacement, which arrived MORE BROKEN than the first item. So by this time, I've been sent a broken item and then issued a broken replacement. I requested a refund at this stage and asos seriously refunded me $9. So asos were going to keep over half of my cash for sending me two items not fit for purpose. That is literally theft as no product deemed fit for purpose and as descripted was exchanged in return for money. So I've waited patiently for months and then had to further chase asos to properly refund me. Am still waiting on a proper refund. Disgusting business practices and business bureau worthy."

With no telephone number to call and endless chats that i've had to make, the asos experience has dropped way below standards. although the refunds are eventually settled, the hassle i have had to go through in making sure they do, is just not worth the the service i'm receiving."

For starters when you send a message to customer service if you have to respond back, you get a different agent every time meaning you have re-explain yourself over and over and over again. I was told by a chat member that my issue would be resolved as they had already offered a solution but it wasn’t the correct amount and my issue was to be escalated but the escalation team is just the worse, it’s been over 1 month I’ve been going back and forth with them. I was asked information that was impossible to come up with!"

Unfortunately, the items were set to ship to the wrong address. I emailed the company multiple times, and they were not able to edit the delivery address from their end although the tracking shipment stated that the items didn't even ship yet!

I've spoken to several customer service representatives and for the most part, they've been wonderful to speak to (particularly Louisa and Rammel). While I couldn't fix my first issue, which required me to travel to my university that I'm not on campus for, Rammel helped me resolve the missing item. I cannot say I enjoyed this shopping experience at ASOS but the representatives I've spoken to were the most pleasant aspect of this purchase, and I appreciate their help."

If it wasn't for the bots creating 5 start reviews, I'm sure their ranking would as low as it should be.Every bad review seen here is accurate. I spoke with an aggressive, condescending, disrespectful associate called Grace (irony). Grace clearly has no home training. I had the same issue as others with the coupon code, and not only would she not honor it, she expected me to make another $250 purchase to try out using the code again! Insane! When asked for the supervisor, she threw names at me and refused to pass me on to someone more capable. In the process of reporting them to the BBB and wherever else possible."

"February 07, 2021",1,I made a purchase online and the…,"I made a purchase online and the promotion code gametime was supposed to be applied, did not. The agent I spoke to stated that the site was having technical issues and she couldn't do anything about it. Ivy kept saying it was 'false advertising', so is this a bait and switch? Which honestly made things worse, and her lack of trying to find a solution to an error that is not a customer's problem was delayed and inadequate. This is not to the customers fault, yet I am being punished. Worse off, if I order twice, is is losing the company more money on labor to pack/ship/return and hurting the environment. I understand policies to protect people from price adjustments all the time; but when it is the company's error, that needs to be fixed. I was that person in many companies to help address issues just like this. Asos and Ivy have let me down.This is being reported to the appropriate authorities and BBB."

"February 07, 2021",1,Pathetic Company,"I had to select the star to write a review but honestly this company doesn’t deserve even a bit of it. I recently placed an order on asos and when my parcel was about to be delivered, I started receiving notifications for ‘collect on delivery’ charges $21.63. I wasn’t informed about these charges while I was placing the order. The company is so pathetic that they do not pay the customs themselves instead transfer the amount to it’s customers. They have this customs charges written down some place where no customer reads them and they know this. So the company is taking advantage of this and also saving itself form any lawsuits. Nobody expects these charges because no other company has ever asked for the custom charges from its customers. I have placed orders online a zillion times and never ever had this issue. Asos is such a pathetic pathetic company which feeds on customers such ignorance. This information should pop up while the customer is checking out and not be kept hidden at some place where nobody reads this as nobody expects the charges.This was my first and last order with Asos and I am soooo done with such a pathetic company."

Contacted the help chat and emailed ASOS and received zero help about my order, eventually got through on the phone to someone in customer service who told me my item had been lost. Then refused to offer any form of kind gesture as good will of me missing the item brought for my sisters birthday and not receiving one update to tell me they had lost my item. I think it’s awful that I should have to work so hard in getting in touch in order to simply get an update that my item is lost. Will not be wasting my time or money on this site again."

On the 22nd it was still not delivered and I have contacted customer service, they told me that there has been an issue with Hermes and raised an investigation with them and that they will get back to me in 48h. Today (7th Feb) still no update so I decided to contact customer service again. The lady Darlyn told me that ""probably her collegue forgot to raise the investigation and she will do it now"" and she added that ""the parcel was damaged"" but she cannot proceed with a replacement or refund until Hermes gets back to them. Seriously??? The parcel is clearly damaged but you still can't do anything about it? ASOS you really disappointed me, I thought you were more serious than this"

Also I wish we could combine returns in the app, they advertise to combine order returns “to save the environment” but then when you’re missing refunds (due to only being refunded for the “returned” order and not the rest), you have to chase it up and it’s very confusing!"

I did this and was told I would have to wait 48 hours to find out what was happening. 48 hours later, I recontact them to be told to wait ANOTHER 48 hours.

She sent me the 28 returns policy for unwanted item but I told her it’s faulty! I told her if she can’t help then I need escalate this issue! She then started ignoring me with no response from her and forced me to hang up the chat! How rude! If spending £170 for something became faulty that’s unlucky, to have chatted to Ana is the nightmare!! I’ve been shopping with ASOS over four years and now it’s time to stop！ I’ll refund everything that eligible to return and never buy again! Thanks for Ana’s help! She’s a bully to a customer!

I've checked the delivery status again today (7 Feb) and it hasn't changed, so I have again contacted ASOS to be told they have asked the courier to deliver ""as soon as possible"". Although they are very polite, this isn't good enough. Neither the retailer nor the courier can confirm what this ""additional information"" is that is causing the delay. My husband didn't have anything to open on his special birthday."

So I take the time to shop on their site and when I go to check out with the promo code they’ve advertised all day it’s suddenly “expired” yet still being advertised on their site. Customer service “Alvin” was rude and dismissive and didn’t make any effort to resolve. He blamed it on technical problems and refused to honor the advertised discount in any way shape or form. He basically said this is their policy, understand it and I can’t help u. So ASOS your policy is to lure your customers in with false advertising and then blame it on technical issues and then say it’s only available to customers who use the code in time (in other words it’s my fault). It’s now 11:10pm est USA and the code is still being advertised. This is how u treat your customers?? This is ethical?? I like to shop places I can trust and who value their customers and this place is not that. App deleted!!!"

The Vans came late as ASOS said the order got lost so they had to replace the order. Once I did eventually receive the order, it was the wrong size. So, I emailed back and forth with ASOS to prepare a return. I sent the return in January 2021 and have yet to receive my refund. After I sent ASOS proof of postage and other materials that prove that I've sent the Vans back, ASOS still keeps asking me if I sent the Vans back. Super disappointing to hold someone's money up like that during a pandemic. I know it won't make a difference as ASOS has plenty of customers but I won't be shopping with you again and I'll warn my friends/family/social media about this experience as well."

There was never any email letting me know whether the package had shipped. The website is totally shutdown, and when trying the return link (they sent when they announced the merger) the topshop page said they had no record of my order. Arcadia Group and ASOS completely failed their role and owes thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people money in returns. ASOS keeps redirecting me to Topshop and washes their hands of all the orders and ignores my direct questions. Truly WT F."

People I talked to on email weren't helpful, the person I talked to on the chat feature was fine, it wasn't her fault that the system she's required to go through is messed up. I've ordered so many times from ASOS and never had a problem, but I'm extremely frustrated at how hard it was to get a refund when ASOS lost my package."

When it arrived Yodel left the parcel outside eventhough I was home. When I found the parcel after receiving the notification, it was ripped open with bubble wrap inside. After contacting Yodel, I then contacted Asos costumer service several time for a refund since I didn't receive my products. I was then met with an email saying that my account was going to be blocked and they wouldn't issue me a refund. I've shopped several time with ASOS, never had a problem, but this time when I needed them and as client, I felt like I was not treated well and I was actually treated unlawfully. Costumer service was appalling all throughout, and I can't even contact them anymore as they blocked my account. Hope they come to their senses as I actually love the shop."

Because of this I then had to send in an email as the live chat function wasn't available. They advised it would take around 24 hours to respond to me, but I heard nothing back from them. I sent another email over a week later and heard nothing back again. I finally got to speak to someone on the live chat function today and the customer advisor was able to refund the missing order but was unable to sympathise with the fact I have had 0 communication or responses to my emails and that they had now managed to lose one of my returns on top of this order. I shop with ASOS very regularly however I was very disappointed with this experience."

"February 06, 2021",1,Absolutely worst company to deal with,Absolutely worst company to deal with. They do not give refunds on items you return. When you contact them they ask you to wait 14 business days. After 14 days elapses they extend it to 21 days. Then an extra 3 days. Then another 3 days and so on and so on. Every customer agent promises your refund will be returned within 3 days. Never happens. Has to be a scam. They give unacceptable excuses that they are busy fulfilling orders and blame the postal service. Then they tell you that you will receive an email with details of your refund - where they ask for proof of return. When you send proof they stop replying. God help you if you lose your proof of postage. Their website still says they refund within 21 days. And I still see constant ads for clothes. This company should not be allowed sell items if they cannot process refunds. I have had to go to Paypal to claim a legitimate refund. Scam artists. Avoid. Will never buy from them again.

ASOS has a wide array of different clothes available, their prices are competitive and they have good sales on offer. The returns process is straight forward and I have not encountered any major issues with them. I've been using for years and continue to do so. Would recommend to others."

And if I want it I should know someone in there country to buy it and send it to me!? What kind of company is this?? What kind of customer service ?

I emailed them asking about the whereabouts of my parcel and they said they would get back in touch with me in the next 48 hours. 2 days went by and i had no further contact from asos, so after a few more days of waiting around- now being a just over a week from placing my next day delivery order, i got back into contact with asos again- starting from the beginning. after another 48 hours of waiting around while they investigate they finally got back to me claiming that it was lost. During this time i had ordered another version of this item, hoping it would arrive in time so i can gift it on and luckily it did, but i am still waiting upon my refund for the lost item"

After receiving my confirmation email i realised they had it set to be delivered at an address I have not used for 2 years, I had changed this address as I had ordered some time before and had set this as my new address for future purchases. I enquired about this and got told that there's is nothing they can do until it had a no. I came back the next day and got told the same thing. I then spoke to someone who said I could only get it redirected if it was in the same postcode as it was by hermes, so I got a friend to give me their address. I then got given a list of instructions, and then went back as I couldn't find anything it was asking, which upon the guy apologised as he forgot to tell me I had to download the app... he then said he would do it for me. I waited 30 minutes ( as he asked me to wait) I then messages again asking how it was going and if he needed anything. He then left the chat. I got another person who said he would read the previous conversation and then he left. I was then left by someone else telling me I was unable to change my redirector and have to message hermes personally."

Tried contacting them via email since they don't have a phone number and no response. Reached out by Facebook messenger and got a delayed response saying it should be there by 27th. However still did not receive it. Finally even on1st when I did not receive it asked them to cancel the order as the dresses ordered were for my registered wedding on 2nd February. Extremely poor service as slow response and no phone number. Live chat told me twice someone will call me and no one did. I had also ordered a night suit from the site and after first wash it has a tear. Again tried contacting them via Facebook messenger and it's been 3 days and no response. The night suit was for € 34 and I can't even wear it. Wonder if they will give me the money back or make an excuse. Also I have been charged for premier delivery when my order did not arrive but since one order arrived they said they cannot refund it. Extremely bad experience and very unhappy with the service

"February 06, 2021",1,I am a regular ASOS user,"I am a regular ASOS user, spending between £100-£350 on the website at least once per month. I received an email from ASOS stating “20% off everything” - as they do fairly often - so I was very happy to purchase some items from my saved list. Upon checking my emails, after I received my order, I realised I didn’t actually get 20% off, I barely even received 10% off my order!So I have gone onto the online chat today to see if I could get a refund for the amount I should have been discounted or get it back in some form of voucher on my account, I was told this can’t be done and they informed me that in the terms and conditions it states that the discount isn’t actually on everything, just a select few times!This is very misleading and I am extremely unhappy with how this has been dealt with, as on the title of my email it stated “20% OFF EVERYTHING” and once I opened the email it had that it huge writing aswell.Usually if ASOS do an offer with discount on selected items, this is clearly stated or there is a specific section on the app for the discounted items but this wasn’t the case and I was extremely misled!!! I do not feel like a valued customer!"

When I contacted customer service they said this was because the items not sent were no longer in stock. However I did not receive an email to notify me the items were out of stock and when I checked the website the items were still showing as in stock. I would understand my items being out of stock if the items were in stock but low quantity on the website. However when I checked this was not the case.On top of this, for the same order I had been notified that an item (a bag) was out of stock and a refund was in process for this. I do not understand why part of my order was sent, part was flagged as out of stock while the other was sitting there with no action taken on it.Had I not taken action and contacted customer service I am unsure I would have received any communication about the items ordered which did not arrive and doubt I would have been refunded."

"February 06, 2021",1,Extremely bad delivery service,"Extremely bad delivery and not very helpful customer service. I ordered an item which was supposed to be delivered on the 29th of January. I was moving house a few days after but with previous ASOS orders they have been early or on time so I didn’t think this would be an issue and it said that it had been shipped 5 days earlier so I presumed it would definitely be on time. Once I moved I spoke to customer service to ask if I could change the delivery address since I did not receive the package but for some reason this can’t be done? She basically ignored my situation and told me to keep waiting. I was upset about this as I knew no one in the building and moved 3 hours away so I knew my order, IF delivered would probably be stolen or thrown out. Due to this I wanted a refund as I would never have ordered of I knew it would be late. Every time I tried to track the order it took me to Pitney bowes which just states it will get an estimated delivery date soon, It had been like that for over a week and my estimated delivery date was already supposed to be the 29th. I spoke to another adviser about this who told me I had to wait until a certain date to get a refund. On this date I went on the customer chat again to express I had not received any email to say my package had arrived and Pitney bowes was still stating the same message that it would have a delivery date for me soon. This adviser told me I had to wait until the following date until a refund could be put through if I had not received it by the following day. The next day I checked the tracking and still nothing so I went back to the chat and was told the adviser from yesterday gave me incorrect information and I have to wait a further 4 days to see if it arrives. I expressed that since I was promised a refund from her colleague the day before, I should still receive a refund since I was told this revised date, that was not my fault it was incorrect and I had screen shots of the chat but she just told me no you have to wait which I think is very unfair since I was told I would receive a refund. I just think the whole thing is ridiculous. I am unable to receive this package now because it wasn’t delivered when it was supposed to be and I keep getting pushed back to wait when I don’t even have an estimated delivery date. The customer service people were polite but not helpful, they more so just brushed me off. This has been such a hassle and I would rather my money back than wait for a package I will never receive due to this awful delivery service. It’s ridiculous that they have no way of tracking the couriers? They are unable to track their own deliveries when it has left ASOS? I find that irresponsible and frustrating. You also should be able to do one address change if needed, such as myself moving. This would have prevented a lot of hardship as I would have been ok to wait for it to arrive at my new home. Overall I would be very cautious when ordering off ASOS and I wouldn’t order again."
"February 06, 2021",1,The worst online store ever,"The worst online store ever. I ordered a watch and I was sent an empty box. I contacted the customer care, they processed my replacement (subject to availability) telling me to look out for an email with new tracking details. Two weeks later there was no email nor a watch. I contacted them again and they told me my replacement was cancelled because the item is out of stock and I already received a refund. They didn't even notify me about the cancellation. I was refunded for the watch but I still had to pay the tax, customs and post admin fee charged by Canada. This was over $40 which I was never refunded! I checked their website again and the watch I ordered is still available just with a different product code and with a higher price. They have it but they chose to cancel my replacement.

I escalated and claimed a refund via PayPal, but had to post the item back at my expense despite it being not as described. I’ve lost £5 postage and three hours of my time due to ASOS ineptitude and poor customer service."
"February 06, 2021",1,Awful customer service,Awful customer service! I ordered a dress for a photoshoot with plenty of time for it to come and it didn’t arrive in time and when I talked to customer service they were absolutely no help!

You shouldn't have advertise a Chinese New Year sale if u cannot deliver it before Chinese New Year! Its a really disappointing experience this time round!
"February 06, 2021",1,Horrible CS,My parcel is still not on d flight even after a wk. Myla told me it will be when n to contact again if i didnt receive by expected date. Come on ASOS. Im sure there are better service recovery methods than to ask me to continue waiting right?
"February 06, 2021",1,Rude and unhelpful.,"After sending the wrong item due to poor labeling on the website, I was told I could not return the item for a refund, and then disconnected from chat without resolving the problem."
"February 06, 2021",1,WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN FROM ASOS BEWARE.,They sent my clothes through a third party carrier Pitney Bowes which NEVER updated the tracking for me. ASOS couldn't tell me where my package was and made me wait nearly three weeks for a refund before finally believing me when I said I did not receive the package. I will never buy from this company again - extremely ridiculous not worth the price of the clothing to go through this much of a hassle. Let's see if they actually send me a refund.
"February 06, 2021",1,False delivery advertisement,"I place 584472190 on February 2, I ordered 150 worth items in order to get 1 day delivery, after a 3 days waiting I contacted ASOS and was told my order will arrive by February 15 !!! 15 days after I placed it, that’s false advertisement and I was not provided want other solution than keep waiting ."
"February 06, 2021",1,I created a return on the website and…,I created a return on the website and never received a return label. When I contacted customer care they said they weren’t able to locate a return location for my area. I gave them direction to locate the local UPS. They said I could either take it to UPS without a label from them but was unclear about how asos would even track the return. In the my orders section the order is listed with only the items I want to keep but there is no record of the returns. The customer service rep was unhelpful and clearly not familiar with the website.

The bag arrived tapped up with two of the items missing and the puffer coat looking like it was dragged across a filthy floor.  The customer service team has me doing more work to fix this damaged item as if I picked and packed it the warehouse.  The rep also has canned messages that they repeated over and over again disregarding what I was saying.  In all, I will have to purchase a box big enough to fit the coat to return it.  ASOS did not want to take any ownership of poor decisions that were made when packing and shipping this product and now it's up to the purchaser to provide solutions for a company that should know better."

I ordered item from Canada for 71$ and then my delivery is held at Canada post saying on sender request i should pay 20$ CAD fees .My question is when i navigated through the order till i completed  the payment in ASOS site , Why are the customers not informed about this fees?When i contacted the customer support chat , i am given with one link in their help and he mentioned its there in help for your reference and it is government fees .WHen it is government fees , then why are the customers not informed at least with a popup? How can we make out that there are these fees if we order from Canada ?Why would customer read your help page while doing a simple online order ?How any customer who are ordering on ASOS be aware of these unmentioned fees during  delivery .I would not use ASOS going forward due to this reason"

ASOS customer service department is not responding to the points I have raised, I am being sent generic responses that feel copy and pasted and standard replies. I do not feel like anyone is listening to the issue. I was sent an email from ASOS with a offer code to use 5 hours after the code was expired I was promised I would have a response from live chat after it was escalated and over a week later I had to chase ASOS for an update and the complaint has been handled by several people all not listening to the issues that suggesting any way to resolve the matter. I am not too worried about the actual saving now the complaint has actually become a complaint over the way this issue is being handled by the customer care team. I was even told the product is no longer in stock when it is and I can still purchase on the website. Sadly it’s very frustrating"

I had to contact them again with a long delay on news from Hermes. Got in touch for the 3rd time and finally a replacement parcel being sent out. Guess what. The jeans I wanted are now out of stock. So I get a refund. After over a month of chasing. Thanks, really annoyed. Won't be using again. ."
"February 05, 2021",5,Rare occurrence of faulty item but customer service was bang on,Not very often that I shop anywhere else nowadays because it’s just easy and stress free to shop at ASOS and to deal with if you have any issues. Recently purchased some trousers that were faulty but the customer service was 10/10 as expected anyway! Fantastic service as always.
"February 05, 2021",5,Professionalism,"At the beginning I didnt receive my order and it was lost with shipping company. I shared this with Asos customer service team and they immediately started following up on my order. The team were very professional and considerate in their emails, and put a lot of effort in this matter. It has been my favorite and only online shopping since the last four years and I am more than happy and satisfied with my experience with Asos."

It was shipped out the very next day I’m very happy with their customer service! They are quick to respond and answer any questions that you may have.
"February 05, 2021",1,Unhappy customer,I was sent an faulty item which I ordered with 20% off on 4th Feb. Even though the website gives an option for replacements I was told a replacement can’t be done and I’d have to reorder the item myself but they couldn’t  honour the 20% discount. Having been a customer for 13 years I’d expected a bit more or at least for this to be looked into. I know ASOS can send one time user discounts as it’s been done before. Very disappointed with the service.

"February 05, 2021",5,Exceeded my expectations!,"Umm, wow? I’d done a lot of searching for an affordable tweed suit for my wedding, and finally stumbled upon ASOS. I found what I was looking for in my size and on sale for just $140, for a 3-piece suit. At that price point, my expectations were, let’s say, tempered. They shouldn’t have been. With free expedited shipping, the suit arrived in a couple days and wildly exceeded my expectations. I’m no connoisseur of suits, but I’m pretty sure I’d have paid $800-1200 for the same suit if I’d gone to a B&M store. VERY happy with my purchase and will be using ASOS again!"

"February 05, 2021",4,Helpful Response!,Richard was very helpful. 4 stars cause phone calls are more efficient than typing out concerns. Wish the wait time was lesser.
"February 05, 2021",2,Not a fan,I would give one star because I've had many issues with my order and the customer service team while trying to get my issues resolved but my last interaction with Nico was the only one where I was finally able to get my issue resolved and within a timely manner. I've been ignored in the past and have had my chats ended without any reply to my issues and have had to go back and forth with multiple people explaining the same issue over and over again. I have not had a pleasant experience with ASOS overall but I'm glad I was finally able to solve by issue with Nico. Hopefully I can get my refund quickly and just be done with this all.

It is like you put food on the menu even if they are not available! I have been buying from you for almost 3yrs now. I always experienced this. But last night was the most excruciating when most of the items in my cart could not be delivered.You must atleast have a system or mechanism that when someone logs in, these will automatically be removed from the options!

I was worried I would of had to fix it myself and I've never fixed a heel before."
"February 05, 2021",1,Sent worn shoes and didn't care,I purchased a pair of uggs from ASOS  . When I got them they had been worn and literally thrown in the box . I spoke to customer service and they didn't care . I am disabled and getting out is hard for me and they said well till I can get them back I won't get a refund . So now have to pay taxi there and back for a pair of worn shoes they sent then wait maybe a week to get money back disgusting company to do that to people and obviously they don't care if clothes are worn and sent back or not
"February 05, 2021",5,Great service for my lost orders,I had 2 orders from different couriers which never turned up to my house. Asos on messenger were a great help!

However, when checking online it said via Hermes the parcel was delayed however, more information would be available in 24 hours. Checked online on 27/01 and there was no update. I’ve had to look for this myself and have had no word from ASOS or Hermes with my order, it’s now 05/02 and still no update.I spoke to ASOS who asked whether I wanted a refund or a replacement. I asked for a replacement only to be told the item was out of stock and despite the other item being in stock they gave me a full refund.Poor communication!"

"February 05, 2021",1,Useless help,I moved from my old address. I updated my account for my default billing and shipping address. Before I placed either one of my orders I made sure that my address for shipping and billing was correct. But for some reason after my order was placed it still said my old address. I was never given the option to cancel or change my delivery address. I contacted 4 different customer service agents. I don’t even understand why ASOS has them because they can’t do anything but tell you that they can’t do anything. I just placed an order last night as one of the agents directed me to it’s still says the old address. This order hasn’t even left yet and they can’t cancel it. So now I have to wait for two orders to be sent to the wrong location and maybe if whoever lives there’s sends them back to ASOS in order to get my money back. I have been having this issue for the last two days and I’m exasperated at this point. I know I’m not in the wrong. I have never in my life sent anything to the wrong location. I’m ready to file a lawsuit because this is beyond crazy.

You will speak to several different representatives, who will all repeat what the other has said and asked. There seems to be no notes kept on the system about any matter, or any reading of previous emails, so you are forever having to repeat and explain yourself. It has taken me 4 months to actually receive a definitive answer about a refund / credit note and now I am battling because for some peculiar reason they’ve put it on my old account which I cannot access anymore.

I didnt have to pay for customs but in a way I had to pay more than just customs. which is insane considering that I only got one thing. I will be doing. a follow up on this and better get a response because other people will also be contacting you. you can get stuck in legal problems when you post MISLEADING INFORMATION ON YOUR WEBSITE."

This is not communicated to you during the checkout period. (you'd have to look further into it and browse their FAQs - which no one does), or I was advised to call my customs office before placing an order with ASOS. (who even does that??).... I got no help, I was told that the issue was going to be resolved and well, nothing got resolved. I was told that I should have called my customs office before placing my order?? (strange). I could have easily been offered the $24.69 fees back that I had to pay..If I would have known that there would be additional fees before purchasing I would not have bought in the first place. She then goes to tell me that there a promo code just for Canadians to help cover these fees - again, something that I was nothing aware of and you'd think would be listed somewhere during the checkout process. - kind of a slap in the face to find out about this after I've paid the fees out of my pocket and still told that there's nothing that can be done from ASOS to refund me those fees. (but next time you order use this code to cover that..)I'm very upset and will not be shopping with ASOS."

I contacted them and the first few people on chat simply stopped replying me after I explained the issue. The last person just said we ran out the right size so we just sent one and asked me to return it. Worst customer service ever, why not just cancel an order rather than send the wrong size and hope the customer doesn't notice. Does not make sense"

Which is just one big hoop of the same c#ap! I just sent another email to say “for the live of god” just tell me where the parcel is “ if they mess up a delivery or run out of goods ... they need to be honest instead of sending their customers on wild goose chase!"
"February 04, 2021",1,Free delivery worldwide?!,"I am a long term customer from Bosnia and Herzegovina. When I used to shop from Asos, minimal amount spent to qualify for free shipping was aroud GBP and now no matter the amount of money I spend, I should pay 10 GBP to have my goods delivered to me. I don't think that is fair, You don't have a respect for Your customers based on their country. 10 GBP is how much an average person in my country earns in one day for 9 hours shift."

My debit card has been rejected so i asked for help, because i want to buy that order but obviously you don't care for it. Maybe now i didn't give you much information on what happened and did i tried something else, but guess what, you gave me zero information about what i asked you. You should make an effort to hear your customer, not just copy paste what you have on hand."

Immediately got onto the web chat to get a replacement, was promised that I would receive the replacement by Sat as I was moving out to a new flat. This did not appear, I contact web chat yet again for a delivery update, was told that it was not processed, so now the 3rd web chat to process the order. Today contacted ASOS again, 4th web chat - told the product is out of stock!!!!!! How can you not check the stock before telling me you have ordered the replacement. How much time I have wasted chasing for this replacement is like over 2hrs on web chat! By far the worst experience I've had with ASOS since being a customer and it's putting me off using them for anything that is breakable because getting a replacement is a nightmare."
"February 04, 2021",1,Not happy,Not happy. Was on online chat for 56 mins and didn't get any answers. On the website it states 15% off new customers i signed up clicked it and no code. Went to chat to someone's and they said it was currently unavailable in my country. False advertisement.

"February 04, 2021",1,ASOS asking for a minimum of 6 weeks to process refunds,"ASOS have previously been really good with returns, but lately they're an absolute disgrace.  They are now asking for a minimum of 6 weeks to refund. It's absolutely shocking, when you reach out to the online chat help, they are always finding ways to extend this refund period. Latest one....weekends don't count as days. Despite what the website says about returns, I'm being asked to wait  21 days for them to process a parcel once its been delivered to their warehouse (lets not forget weekends don't count, so that's 4 weeks and 1 working day) and they also want a further 10 working days to process the refund. Quick to take your money! But 6 weeks for a refund....good one ASOS."

Read back my conversation and you will see. You just lost a very loyal customer over something that should have been VERY SIMPLE to resolve.
"February 04, 2021",1,I am so disappointed of ASOS,"I am so disappointed of ASOS. After being a customer for a good while, I had placed an order end of December and 4 days later I had not received it. I contacted ASOS through the chat as there is no number to call. After speaking to a rep I was told the parcel was left at my neighbour’s but the address didn't even match. ASOS said they had to investigate and then I got an email confirming it was delivered to the wrong address. Not even within the same city. I had to contact them again to ask about my order, they asked me to go to that address, that it’s not even close to me and attempt to collect it myself ( from London to Herfortshire) but then again I am asked to wait 5 days to investigate. The time passed and I had to contact them again, saying they still need to investigate why the courier DPD had delivered the order to an unknown address. At this point I’m requesting a full refund as the order was never delivered to me and it was confirmed by ASOS that the order was delivered to the wrong address. ASOS asked me once more to wait 3 days as they needed to contact DPD and investigate more. I contact them again as ASOS never contacted me to give me an update. To my disbelief, I am told to wait 10 more days so DPD would attempt to collect the order from the wrong address and once ASOS gets the items back I would get my refund. Guess what? 10 days passed and still no news. Contacted ASOS again and now they are saying that I did get the items, that DPD confirmed that it was delivered to me. I wanted to cry, I had to repeat myself all over by chat and remind them that I have proof from ASOS confirming the order was delivered to the wrong address. They are now saying I need to contact the courier to investigate myself, that ASOS has done their bit and there is nothing else they can do. I was left in shock at their response. I don’t know what to do any more. I’ve lost my money for an order that was delivered to the wrong address and that ASOS doesn’t want to take responsibility for. Even though it seems it was the courier’s fault, the purchase agreement was between ASOS and I, regardless of their contractors failing them. This is simply unacceptable and have gone through a lot of distress because of this."
"February 04, 2021",1,Didn't help at all,Didn't help at all.  Information was lost in transition from topman to ASOS and they couldn't even locate my order that I have confirmed in two emails.  They're not refunding me the full amount of my order.  Terrible experience.
"February 04, 2021",4,"Lovely assistance from live chat, not much action so far","Michelle was extremely lovely and helpful! My order was missing an item and I have been in touch with the support team on live chat. Unfortunately another team member told me I would get an email in 24 hours stating a replacement item would be shipped to me again, depending on availability. None such email came so I contacted asos again via the live chat and Michelle was kind enough to follow up with the team."
"February 04, 2021",4,Very good overall,"If you have said that ASOS is the worst company that you have ever used, then truthfully you are either not a real customer(a competitor behaving very unfairly), or you are having a REALLY BAD DAY. You really need to try out other companies before sharing an unfair view on ASOS. Ive used them for years, and sure Ive had the odd frustration with regards to delivery delays or things missing.. But jeez.. come on.. in years of daily and weekly deliveries, they have proven themselves to be very reliable on the whole."

"February 04, 2021",1,The WORST company I EVER used,"This is honestly the worse company I have ever used in every aspect. I have made a few orders from them in the past, however I never had a positive experience and all I had was issues since purchase, delivery, to returns/refunds and customer service. It was so bad that at the time I even emailed the CEO and I never had a reply, so I just decided to stop using ASOS completely.However, on Christmas someone gave me an ASOS gift card. I knew instantly I would have issues but as I had the card, I used it. Well, I had to place the order 3 times so it could go through as it kept failing due to ASOS system issues (it took me over 1 hour to place an order of 1 item). Then, the order never arrived (all I need to say is that the courier they use is Hermes and I guess the majority will understand). I tried to contact ASOS several times with no success. At this point, I have been waiting for over 1 month for my refund, and is just impossible to speak with ASOS. On the live chat the customer service advisors just do not reply to you (i have been over 20min waiting for a reply from Alyssa and others do not even connect). I have sent a complaint weeks ago regarding the whole issue along with other emails and messages to ASOS on facebook which I never had a response. I mean, everything is just terrible with ASOS and I NEVER had a positive experience with them. All they care is to take your money. Avoid if you can, I will definitely avoid this company and spread the word as quick as I can so people do not go through the same where there are other similar much better companies."

It got so complicated to the point I had to call 8 times for it to finally get a resolution. I was refunded incorrectly for an item which was returned and then I was refunded incorrectly for an item that I kept. Long story short,  It was a nightmare and wasn’t getting resolved no matter how many times I called. Eventually I spoke to a lovely lady and she managed to get me the correct refund and she sent an email to say all was now resolved. I am a loyal ASOS shopper and I use the app to shop for my whole family and Iv never had these problems in the past, so this was a just a little blip as I have always had great customer service with ASOS. We got there in the end after many frustrated phone calls and it is now resolved and it hasn’t deterred me from continuing to shop with them in future. Thank you ASOS."

On the confirmation email it stated the delivery address (my previous address) and that it would be delivered standard delivery on Tuesday 9th Feb (6 days from now) I then started a live chat and only to be told that I had to make my way to my previous address and collect it from there. Not only do I not know the new occupiers of that address but its too far away to travel, especially in times like this! I was then told that I had to request the courier to send the parcel back to asos when they received it, they then stated they may deliver it anyway! Why not just NOT send it and cancel my order?!?!?! So annoyed!"

"February 04, 2021",1,not willing to help the customer,"I needed help with the order was correctly stated making the order.  But asos shipping company (or partner company dealing with the shipment) has made mistake in instead sent it to a completely different city. I clearly stated my shipping address when making my order and this situation is not my fault, so I believe that the shipping company has to fix this. I called the shipping company that was the last one that handled my package  and they stated that only sender can change the address to correct one and fix this mistake. So I contacted asos  to contact any delivery parties tehy have, because I do own a company myself and I know that you can always contact your shipping provider. But customer service is telling me that this is not possible and I will never get my order and I just have to wait for a refund. I feel terrible because I have never had this kind of issue with any other company. They always want to help and deliver the orders. It's against my customer rights to never receive an order because of someone else's mistake and just get a refund. I waited for these items. I chose asos because I trusted them and I had plans for these items. This makes me feel like asos doesn't care about their customers at all."

So I went to order another 2 orders just to get a confirm from them later that the staff advised me was not coached properly(?!) and I still got to pay for all the delivery fee of 3 orders total of 17 pounds (while the premier delivery subscription is 10 pound a year?!)

When I asked ASOS if I could receive my package any other way, they said no, and that they would just refund me. I am incredibly disappointed as I waited over a month for my items, only to find out they won't try and ship them to me any other way. I am also waiting for a refund for my first package I ordered back in December, which has not been refunded yet and it's almost been 21 days now.

"February 04, 2021",1,The “receiving wrong item” pattern.,"Hi,Well it’s look like because of your policy ASOS is basically making profit from sending wrong items. I got 2 wrong items in 2 different shipments last month, in both cases I have been told to return the items if I want to get a refund.The problem is that if I want to order the same item again I have to create a new order so if I was using promo code it’s no longer valid so I have to buy it in a different price and if the price of the item isn’t high for free delivery then I probably buy more stuff.My first problem is that ASOS doesn’t really care for the customer experience and taking responsibility for their mistakes.My second problem is the lightness that ASOS takes review which imply that you are getting profit from this situations.Thanks"

The clothes were returned and the return was acknowledged but the refund was not given.Every time I contact customer service (~6 times) they tell me it’s “locked to my account” but it’s clearly not in my account for me to see or use. I have provided screen grabs and screen recordings but I always get told they’ll be in contact in 48 hours... but they never do.If this was my work hours you’d be billed pretty heavily compared to what the voucher is worth.

"February 04, 2021",1,ONE STAR AS YOU CANT GIVE LESS!!,ONE STAR AS YOU CANT GIVE LESS!!They dont care about you as a customer or providing any form of customer service.   On the online chat systems they just cut you off to avoid answering questions and on the phone if you can get through they just say someone else is dealing with your issue but you can never talk to anyone else!    I will not spend another penny with this company or any of the business it buys to screw other customers under different names!       I am still waiting to hear back from them or for my order or for a refund!  dont waste your time or money on this poor excuse for a retailer!
"February 04, 2021",1,Delivery was due today,"Delivery was due today, received an email three days ago telling me the order is on its way. Checked the courier's tracker today and they still haven't received the item. Contacted you via the chat to chase up my delivery and spoke to Julian who told me to wait 2 further days and check the tracker again and then get back in touch if it still hasn't been updated. I said I would like this to be chased up and have my delivery asap. Julian told me he 'doesnt know what else to tell me as he has already told me to wait two days', before completely ignoring me in two seperate chat windows for 45 minutes, then to send a link to trustpilot to leave feedback. Really poor service."

"February 04, 2021",1,Horrible customer support,"Horrible customer support extremely rude and useless. I've asked politely for my refund since I had already returned the item and mentioned they couldn't help me.

"February 04, 2021",1,Terrible fast fashion company,"Terrible fast fashion company - change their return policy over the holidays when things are on sale, so when you try to return and refund something, they’ve bumped the prices back up and you can’t afford to repurchase.On top of this they sent me faulty items, and then rejected their own liability for doing so and my return and refund attempt. Might I add, as the huge unethical fast fashion conglomerate they are - they won’t even pay for your shipping on items they reject your refund for. With that in mind, I’d like to say a big f*** you to ASOS - will never shop here again, and I hope the company goes to s***"
"February 04, 2021",1,Shambolic customer service,"I ordered some jeans last THURSDAY and the order didnt go through - however you still charged me. I didnt get an order number as a result. I spoke to Ronnie on Thursday who said this would be sorted in 48 hours (after not wanting to help me at all). Unsurprisingly, this wasnt sorted and I spoke to Xavier (might have been Xavien) on Monday who said it would be sorted in 72 hours. Lo and behold, it's still not been resolved and I am fuming. I provided all the detail you needed to find this payment/order. I have lost complete faith in ASOS and am now seriously contemplating closing my account with you and using other providers to online shop.The info provided to me by a consultant today showed that the information I needed was made available after 48 hours, but not conveyed to me - another great display of customer service.It appears my issue is still yet to be fully resolved (unless ASOS use generic templates for all queries) and instead of asking for a complaint to be raised, I have to manually do one myself which I have never seen before. I am incredibly unhappy with ASOS  and would recommend people use Boohoo instead."

"February 03, 2021",1,In Canada? Don't shop ASOS.,"Shopping ASOS as a Canadian customer was a nightmare and I will not be shopping there again. Their policy states that orders under $150 CAD will not face duty charges, so I placed three separate orders. When the packages arrived at the post office, I had to pay over $20 in COD remittance for each package; this was 25-30% of my order amount. Their website states that orders are still subject to sales tax and handling fees. This means that I paid 10-15% in handling fees for each order; almost the same as sales tax in Canada. I returned two of my orders but was told these fees would not be refunded. While US customers are at least supposed to be refunded sales tax, Canadian customers get nothing. Be advised that they charge $22.40 per package for return shipping through Canada Post. Thankfully I use PayPal, so I was able to get the return shipping refunded. Still, I learned a very costly lesson not to shop at ASOS again. My only positive note is that their customer service representatives were polite."
"February 03, 2021",5,Great customer service,"The customer service agent Raphael was courteous, prompt and helpful in providing me with the information I needed to complete my return.

Both black and platforms but well done ASOS.I will get a refund in around 10 days and I can repurchase them if I'd like for full price as they can't honour sales prices or discountsJOKE!!

Which is more than I can say about some other clothing stores... The delivery is quick (especially if you pay for NDD for the year!) I’ve seen some negative comments regarding delivery, however I believe this to be pressures of online purchasing this past year and not the company 🦠 If I have ever needed to return an item, it is solely because it rather did not suit me or I bought several of the same, as I do prefer some clothes oversized. The quality of the clothing is always 10/10 and the pricing is super reasonable 💰 ASOS upload clothes everyday! So there is plenty to choose from. They keep the clothes new and “in trend” 😍I have many friends/family that also use this company for their clothes/shoes purchases and again... no problems. I have deducted a ⭐️ because id love this company to come to stores!"

"February 03, 2021",1,Terrible customer service,"Terrible customer service. Emails / instant chats are either robots or staffed by brainless individuals who do not read messages correctly before copy & pasting stock responses. Despite me contacting Hermes, who promptly completed their investigation and confirmed they cannot retrieve my parcel from where they incorrectly delivered it too, ASOS seem to still think it’s a good idea to tell me to continue to check with neighbours and in sheds / bins and other potential “safe” places.

"February 03, 2021",1,Asos and Yodel - the worst of the worst.,"Please be aware that ASOS do tend to use Yodel as well as Hermes as couriers.Whilst both these courier companies are at the lowest end of the spectrum for reliability note that if you end up (by chance) to be lumbered with Yodel, you could be waiting till well after 8pm.This is how ASOS becomes unreliable and unacceptable when compared to the more reliable and premium brands."

"February 03, 2021",1,"I am not mad, just disappointed.","I ordered pants from ASOS. The first time I rcvd my order they sent the wrong pants. Okay, fine, I didn't want to leave my house due to COVID. I was like okay I will reorder them. I reordered them. AGAIN they delivered the wrong pants. So, I reached out to ASOS asking for them to send me the correct pair. They said no, I have to send the pants back first. I was like I can send a picture of the pants for proof they are wrong, they said no you need to return them, okay I cant leave my house right now. They said nope sorry. So I have spent 44 dollars, rcvd two pairs of pants I didn't order and NOW have to be inconvenienced and go to the post office which I don't want to due because of COVID. BECAUSE THEY SENT ME THE WRONG PANTS TWICE. like at this point just chalk it up and send me the right pants...It is just so frustrating. Not every situation is black and white. Obviously someone stocked the shelves wrong and keep pulling the wrong gear, I get it people make mistakes. But, I shouldn't have to keep going to the post office to return these pants. Like can you just send me the pants I ordered?The customer service guy was fine but wouldn't let me speak to the management team, he said they are trained to handle these issues. I get it but also there are managers in place for reasons and situations like this. To make calls and keep customers happy.Anyways. Still pantless lol.-Sad face"
"February 03, 2021",1,Items never arrive,"Everytime ASOS has a 20% sale I never receive my parcel. I was expecting my parcel yesterday but Hermes tracking app is saying it has not arrived with them yet. I have spoken to Hermes who have also confirmed they have not received this parcel. Contacting ASOS you said to wait another 2 days to see if it arrives, what is the point in waiting 2 days if you have not dispatched the parcel after 5 days? It’s delaying the process of me getting the items I pay for or a refund when the basics of shipping an item paid for cannot be fulfilled."
"February 03, 2021",1,WARNING,"WARNING: Will take your money, and just cancel the order without returning the money. 13 days now since they cancelled the order. According to ASOS, they never took any money from my account. According to MY ACCOUNT they took 2x the transaction amount, and has deposited nothing back.They are fully stonewalling me, just sending standard replies. Will have to file a police report and try to sue for my money back I guess?Didn't think a huge company like asos would do this."
"February 03, 2021",1,The quality of ASOS' products and the experience has declined.,"I was sent the incorrect item twice.  I contacted ASOS via the chat and email and did not receive the assistance or information needed.  I usually enjoy purchasing from ASOS, but that has changed. These have been horrible experiences.   I placed two orders, one was the initial order and a second order repurchasing the item that should have been delivered in the original order.  Neither order had the item that I purchased, yet the wrong item continued to be sent.  I requested to be refunded my shipping fees on the second order due to the incorrect item being delivered again.  Customer service evaded providing necessary information, yet continued to provide me with irrelevant information."
"February 03, 2021",1,Very poor customer service,"Very poor customer service so far. I am trying to return an order I bought in December for my daughter's birthday in January. Due to lockdown I had to post them to her and she posted them back to me to return, but all that took a bit longer than the 28 days return. No understanding or flexibility from asos for individual circumstances especially with the global pandemic changing normal home life. I am very disappointed and angry that I seem to have lost £72 which I can ill afford to lose. They have not even offered an exchange and no opportunity to take this further."
"February 03, 2021",5,Refund Inquiry,"George was very quick and efficient in helping me figure out what was going on with my 2 return orders by providing me with clear next steps, if my refund is still missing by the end of tomorrow's date (Feb. 4th)."
"February 03, 2021",5,Great Customer Experience,I had a great customer experience with Dawn. She was so so helpful and kind. She managed to resolve my refund issue in no time. My return parcel was lost (by Fastway Couriers - the worst delivery drivers EVER and nothing to do with ASOS) and this made me panic because I didn't think I would get my refund. But I gave all my screenshots and receipts to Dawn and she was able to process my refund. Such great service!
"February 03, 2021",1,No Delivery and no help,I have waited over a week for a delivery and everytime  I have gone on chat I've been fobbed off and fobbed off. Finally today I was told it would be cancelled and reordered. Oh no. NOW I have  to wait ANOTHER 48 hours. Absolutely ridiculous. Especially when I pay for NDD. Not Impressed!!

After no information regarding my order could be offered, I asked if there were anything that could be offered to keep me a satisfied customer considering my order, which was over $400, was 2 days late and they said there was nothing they could help me with.  Really no support at all and will probably no longer shop with ASOS as a product of this experience."

I always check the size guides but often the sizing is way off or the items are just bad quality. At least returns are easy but it's just such a pain. They have added reviews now which does makes it easier to know if items are bad quality. I am no longer going to order from ASOS not only because of this, but also because of how bad it is for the environment. I would recommend you shop elsewhere."

Before reaching out the ASOS rep I had contacted the FedEx(shipping) to change the address. They informed me only the shipper can change the address. I told the rep about this and was still told that were nothing that can be done. I was told to go to the address to retrieve my package. Did the rep not realize how dangerous this can be? Imagine a stranger coming to your home to get a package. My issue was not resolved nor did I think the representative made any effort for my problem.

The product would not stick and seemed faulty, I checked back online to see the review on ASOS website and it stated that a lot of people was having issues. Normally I would not check reviews as I always trust the products from ASOS after ordering from there for many years. I spoke to customer service representative and explained my issue I understood I could not return the item due to it being unhygienic but She was very helpful and offered to help me by giving a refund or the option to reorder the product. The issue was resolved efficiently, she was very polite and made my day as I really thought I’d be stuck with a faulty item.Thank you so much for helping me so quickly keep up the good work that you do for your customers!"

"February 02, 2021",1,I am SO utterly disappointed,"I am so utterly disappointed. I am 1000% positive I will never order from ASOS again. I had to pay a $17 COD remittance fee in Canada when I picked up my order. When i asked an ASOS rep about it, they kept referring me to their Customs and import charges page. Hidden within those pages was a reference to a code that could gave saved me 15% to offset these import fees if I had known to scour through all their policies. I asked them to apply this refund of 15% after the fact, and the rep simply kept telling me I should've known better before I made the order. I don't understand this. If you have my address and know it's coming to a country that applies import duties and fees, INFORM me at the checkout. OR EVEN BETTER, automatically apply this discount instead of keeping it secretly stowed away on some remote page far away from my checkout page. And then don't keep telling me it's MY fault and ""buyer beware"" when I ask you for help. This was an AWFUL experience and I will NOT be shopping here again."

"February 02, 2021",1,Avoid Avoid Avoid!,Ordered some headphones for Christmas gift - £89. The items arrived faulty and ASOS accept full blame (they actually no longer stock the product due to the number of issues). They received my item back outside their 28 day return policy (which is actually void due to them having sold faulty goods) so they are refusing to refund the money and offer only a credit note. All emails and tweets have been ignored. Disgusting
"February 02, 2021",2,No Tracking Available.,"I usually shop ASOS frequently. However, my recent order has been a mess. I ordered a dress for Valentine’s Day almost 2 weeks ago and it has still not arrived. I reached out to customer service to see if they could locate my package and they told me there was no tracking number. How is there not tracking?? This is absolutely ridiculous. I paid $60 for a dress that I have no idea where it is and i’m unable to track it."
"February 02, 2021",1,"ASOS came recomended, but then this happened...","ASOS came recomended, and I like the sound of the business model. I set up an account (nice and easy) and placed my first order. Branded products, well priced, clear website. So far, so good.One I paid everything started going wrong. They were a little late dispatching the order, then their couriers were delayed. But, never mind - they promised to send an update in 24 hours. One week later I still had no update and no delivery. The live chat had a long wait time, so I emailed. And got no response to my emails.Another week passed (now three weeks from date of order), and I finally got hold of someone on the live chat. They assured me that the couriers hadn't lost it; it was merely delayed(!). They couldn't issue a refund as it was not lost. Which stung a bit. However, don't worry; they'd be able to mark it lost in a couple of days then they'd certainly issue a refund.Obviously this didn't happen. Nor did they respond to my further emails. I had a 30min live chat session that got precisely nowhere.After 5 weeks from ordering the product I had a long battle over the live chat and eventually got a refund processed. Which should be back in my account in a further 3 days.I think that it's fair to say that i think they are better at building a website than fulfilling orders. And better at branding than customer care. The time and aggravation it took to get the refund simply wasn't worth the £100 back. It'd have been better to ignore it and write it off as a lesson learnt.Never again. Never."

Was told not to worry would be returned to asos on 12th and would be refunded within the next few days after. It wasn't returned until 22nd and tracking shows was received back at asos on 27th. I have sent numerous emails to them including a complaint and no response other than generic emails referring to faqs on website! It's now February and still no refund. Second problem I have had with asos and refunds recently and this has really made me rethink my longstanding relationship with them.

"February 02, 2021",1,Poor customer service skills,Hermes as usual are incompetent at delivering items next day delivery when you pay for this from asos .and asos customer services are incompetent at listening. Repeatedly being told at 7pm to wait till the following day to investigate my missing order when hermes tracking shows they couldn't find the address despite it being on a main road. Shambles from asos. Not interested once they have your money
"February 02, 2021",1,If I could give a 0 I would,"If I could give a 0 I would. Someone just closed out the chat on me. I waited so long to talk to someone, and that person waited 5 mins for me. Honestly, this has been the crappiest experience with a store ever. I am so disappointed in ASOS. First the delivery expectations were set incredibly wrong. I ordered my engagement shoot dress specifically from ASOS because of the shipping time promises. The shipping was delayed far beyond what was promised. This was not the carriers fault, but ASOS' since they did not send out the item for 4 DAYS when the item is promised to your door in 6. Because of this fault of ASOS I had to reschedule my engagement shoot. Again, if this was carrier delays due to COVID, that would be understandable, but this is ASOS' fault for delaying sending the shipment out so late. Besides that, the shipment was sent to the local post office and not my home. Another disappointment. I have sent an email regarding this to ASOS care. I just picked up the shipment and ITS MISSING MY DRESS! The camel colour dress which was the most important item in the shipment IS NOT IN THIS PACKAGE. I am so disappointed in this experience and will be using my social media platforms to ensure others know not to buy from ASOS after this horrific experience."

Had a live chat with customer service informing me that i would receive the correct piece express mail if I returned the incorrect item. I return the incorrect item and what do they do? they did the opposite of what was agreed upon and refund me. So I’m left with only a bikini top. Top is useless without the bottom. I Contact customer service again and they disregard what they originally informed me only to tell me to place another order. I told them that the item was now sold out & they should compensate me for the Original Error & the misinformation I was provided. Customer service than said they would compensate me as long as I place another order. I asked how they would compensate me & the rep says “actually I can’t provide any discount or voucher for you since we refunded you”. I told her than why tell me to place an order & would be compensated? Customer service was no help. ASOS is trash anyways. Just buy from the original stores.
"February 02, 2021",2,Disappointed with the changes,"This is the review for my recently experience only. I’ve been a customer with Asos for over a decade, I have placed minimum  500 plus orders and i have always had great experience however, there has been so many terrible changes lately .(1) returns take way way longer, I’ve never experienced returns taking this long for a refund.  For at least 2 years I had my refund back in my PayPal account within 2or 3 working days, and years prior to that the longest maybe just 10 days. But my recent refund it took over 1 month. And I still have one other return waiting for refund and now it has been over 3 weeks and counting.  I have no idea what has changed with the return policies.  (2)sizing has changed dramatically, description totally incorrect, I like baggy  fitting even I am skinny I still wear 2XL in regular fit. My Asos design regular fit are mostly the same size. For oversized fit I downsize to XL.  However, I have ordered a few regular fit asos design lately they are way too oversized, it is not regular fit, it should be  oversized fit in the description box. Very misleading, it’s waste of time and money for customers to return the items due to incorrect sizing description. (3) For many years asos always had a short video for models to demonstrate the clothes, and You get much better idea with the sizing, fitting and design. It helped so much with placing the order. But asos has taken that away, I think I’ve returned so many orders with sizing issues ever since, a demo video would potentially prevent so many returns. Asos please take customers’ feedbacks into account and make better changes, so we can enjoy the wonderful customer shopping experience it once has."

"February 02, 2021",1,Takes your money and makes everything difficult when they make a mistake.,"I placed an order using a gift card. The items I purchased were on sale. My order turned up, and it was early which was a bonus, and the only positive in the whole situation. I open my package and I've been sent someone else's order. I assume this will be an easy fix as it was a mistake by Asos, not myself but nope. I have to return the items (which has been done), wait for them to receive package which could be up to 10 days, then they will process me a refund and then I can reorder. This means it will be around 2 weeks from my actual purchase. I would have absolutely no issue doing this if it was a mistake I made e.g. wrong size, changed my mind, even if it was faulty. Instead I have to wait to be refunded, then reorder, and if the items are no longer on sale pay the difference then apply for them to refund the difference. This is such a backwards and awful process for an ASOS problem and failure."
"February 02, 2021",1,Missing package,"I have had a missing package for a month now and upon contacting UPS I was told that ASOS needed to file a claim which the represenative will not do. This is a joke, a total waste of $75 for a missing item that probably cost them $5 to make."
"February 02, 2021",1,Asos is a terrible company,"Asos is a terrible company. Their customer service is unhelpful, incoherent and quick to dismiss you even when you are asking the most simple questions. It costs the same amount as the product to return it if you're in Canada, which makes returns useless, and they don't offer sizing details on their products and their customer service reps ""don't have that information""."
"February 02, 2021",5,Kristan is the best!,"Kristan is the best! I was worried about the item I had returned that it was lost in the mail. She was sympathetic to my concerns, and assured me would be ok. She resolved the issue efficently and promised to personally send me a email if any other issues arise and to update me. Give her a raise!"
"February 02, 2021",1,STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM ASOS AS YOU CAN,"I had to contact ASOS customer service a total of 21 times before my issue was resolved. I kept getting generic answers as if my email had not been read or just sheer incompetence. The worse part is, this was me trying to get a refund for an order that was entirely wrong! I didn't receive a single item that I ordered, and it took more than two months to finally get my money back. I only received a helpful reply when I lodged a case with a lawyer at the European Consumer Protection Centre. My advice- I know ASOS is really affordable which makes it tempting, but its just not worth it!"
"February 02, 2021",1,Poor customer service/ Scamming people,"Poor customer service, the agent cant even provide his supervisor to provide a resolution to my concern. I will definitely make everyone aware of this. You're scamming people and your team/customer service cant provide any resolution at all. You're agent is just giving a sympathy which I dont really need. I need my item to be delivered with a PRIORITY OTHERWISE I WILL DEFINITELY LOOK TO SUE YOUR COMPANY."

"February 02, 2021",1,Never ordering from ASOS again,"Never ordering from ASOS again, it's just not worth the hassle of delayed delivery, extortionate customs fees, printing off shipping labels and return forms, and paying postal fees for returning items.I've ordered from ASOS a few times and never had issues until my most recent order where I was charged $152.91 CAD in customs and delivery took 2 weeks longer than the estimated delivery date provided. It also turns out (if you go searching hard enough in the customer care section) that Canadian customers are entitled to a 15% discount on every purchase but it's not automatically applied at checkout based on your location being Canada, you have to find this code buried in a support article and apply it manually at checkout. I found this after I had made the purchase and ASOS wouldn't apply the discount retroactively.I was happy with most of the items that came but had to send 3 items back which is no problem, but there is no shipping label or return form included in the delivery (literally every other online retailer I order from includes these in their packages) so you have to print off these items. I don't have a printer at home so I have to find somewhere that's open during a State of Emergency in Ontario where basically everything is closed, to print off these forms.Finally, to add to the inconvenience of having to print those forms, I got charged $22 in postal fees. I did bring all of this up via ASOS' Customer Care Chat and the agent I was dealing with was very friendly but not helpful in the slightest as they were just copying and pasting from articles that I already looked through in the Customer Care section. In summary, this was a very poor customer experience and I won't be shopping on ASOS again."

ASOS have been awful through this whole situation, as someone who regularly shops at ASOS this whole situation has completely put me off ordering from them in the future."

"February 02, 2021",1,Likely not ordering again,"I had ordered a parcel on the 21st of November and chose the longer delivery option as it was free and estimated delivery for the 17th of December, well before Christmas. It never arrived, and at the end of December and the beginning of January I contacted support three separate times to try and get help with it. I only received any kind of help on the third try, when I was told I would receive a refund. Then Hermes decided to update the tracker for the parcel claiming they'd delivered it at 11:59pm on the 17th of December. THEN a week later ASOS got back to me saying Hermes claimed to have delivered it, and could I please check it wasn't with me. After I confirmed it wasn't with me, I ended up waiting another three weeks for any kind of response, emailing every so often to ask for an update, and eventually I managed to get a refund. Nine weeks after i'd ordered the parcel and six weeks since it was supposed to arrive. I understand it was a busy time of year, but I felt very disappointed by the lack of communication and effort. Likely won't be ordering from ASOS again."

"February 02, 2021",1,Absolutely terrible service!,"Absolutely terrible service!Hermes who are also terrible picked up 3 parcels but I got an email an hour later stating they only picked up 2 and that 1 failed collection. This is where the problems began! Hermes do not allow you to contact them and their social media team only respond to photos of damaged parcels and will ignore all other service issues. So I tweeted both Hermes and ASOS on the collection day foreseeing a potential issue to tell them why happened....both ignored that tweet. Fast forward a week and I don’t get refunded for the parcel that was taken and not scanned into the Hermes system. I had to continually go through the conversation loop explaining to ASOS what had happened and everytime they send you the copy and paste message “we know how important getting your refund is...blah blah blah” which holds little water after the seventh time of hearing it with no resolution to then be asked to provide proof of postage again! I sent a photo of the collection note which stated 3 collected and even a photo from my home cctv of the Hermes guy carrying away the 3 parcels! After days of this same circular conversation I then had to provide them a screen shot of the tracking info from Hermes, something they could of just entered into the Hermes tracking website themselves days previously if that’s what they needed as I’d given them the tracking number 6 times!? I can only assume it wasn’t on the script so the service team didn’t know what to do other than start the script again and see if they got a different answer from me....sadly they just started getting my previous messages copied and pasted back to them from previous days as it contained all the info they kept on asking for. Complete fail, a word of warning do not make any expensive purchases from ASOS as there’s a real chance you may not get your refund, and if you do you’ll need more evidence than the FBI could collect to prove your innocence! Next time I’m pulling the Hermes guy in for an hour long interview and legally binding contract of parcel acceptance just to be sure I’m covered."

"February 02, 2021",1,"Late delivery, missing item and unhelpful customer care","I have placed my order at the start of January and it was estimated to be delivered within 10 days. After I still haven’t received any update or my package I have reached out to the customer care regarding the order and was told it’ll be another few days late. This happened multiple times and at the end I have received my package 2 weeks late after it was supposed to be delivered! It not only came ripped, damaged and sellotaped but also with some of the items missing from the package. After yet again I had to reach out to customer care through email with this issue they failed to reply to my email and yet again I was left having to go out of my way reaching out on the online chat as my emails were being ignored. So going back and forth for about 2/3 weeks I was finally told they’ll try to send a replacement for the missing items. I have always heard good things about ASOS and having this as my very first experience with ordering from them especially an order that was certainly a big one clearly has left me very disappointed as it’s all been a one big joke from start to finish!"
"February 02, 2021",1,It is ridicuous not to be able to give  refund after 30 days,"It is ridicuous not to be able to give a ZERO rating to this company.  I have had the worst customer service from them that I have ever experienced from any retailer.  They are having an absolute laugh at the expense of Irish online shoppers with their so-called ""returns policy for Ireland"".  To be brief, I returned an item on 2/01 for refund, all in accordance with their instructions.  Having chased this up with them countless times, they couldnt even tell me where the parcel was though it was ""in their system"".  The supposed 21 ""working""days for returns from Ireland is a joke.  They have no reason to accelerate this because it means they can hold onto the funds for as long as they wish.  After all it doesnt normally take 21 working days for Asos to take your payment or despatch an order so why would it take that long to refund.  Anyway, Asos operate 7 days a week, so much for 21 working days, ""not including weekends"".  According to my calculations, it is now 31 days today from when it was returned and in their system.  Very shoddy customer service.  Buyer beware of this kind of operating.  No wonder they can spend millions buying up other businesses!"
"February 02, 2021",1,Order status said shipped but was Out of Stock!,"I was So excited to find all of these items on ASOS so I placed my order on Jan 19, est. delivery date was Jan 27. There haven’t been any updates so I contacted customer service on Feb 2 and was told that my times were all out of stock so I will have to be refunded. All of this expectation for nothing. Please do not allow your customers to order items that are OUT OF STOCK and the also send them a shipped confirmation update when nothing even left the warehouse. I’m very disappointed."
"February 02, 2021",1,disgraceful,"I ordered an item at a discounted rated then after the expected delivery date I was told the item was damaged in transit and sent back to the warehouse, it would take 10 days to get to the warehouse and then 10 days for a refund to be issued. I was told they were unable to send me a replacement and to get the item I would have to purchase it again and they would refund the difference in 20 days. when looking at the item after this all discount codes were removed.  the item was fairly expensive I have no idea why they couldn't send a replacement and the staff on the web chat couldn't explain that either. they refused to put me on to a manager as well. I think this is out of order as I had already paid for the item once but to receive they were forcing me to buy it twice."

I gave it a few days and i contacted the customer team on asos and i spoke to someone who said they would chase it up with hermes and would get back to me heard nothing for 3 days so contacted them again and just had random please saying different things they were looking eventually i spoke to someone on the 24th who said i would get a refund now but i had chased them up on this now 5 times. I got no refund & then today i spoke to a customer support assitant who said they will actually put the refund now in which is so fustrating as i was promised a few weeks agao i has a refund. I appreciate the person i spoke to today but honestly i thought asos were more of a trustworthy and reliable company but defo not impressed or happy as i place many orders with them in the past but never needed to reach  out to customer service.At this point i am not  sure if i will be getting a refund.  Not sure if i will be wanting to make any more orders with this company & just thought i would share my honest true experience."

And when it comes to discussing refunds, expect that that won’t do anything until you harass the hell out of them. Their customer service is shocking  and abysmal."

Almost three weeks later and no refund or a redelivery of the items I had ordered. It has genuinely been like getting blood from a stone.The customer service chat is glitchy, always disconnecting, and those on the other line might do well to go on a crash course for customer relations.This is not the first time I have experienced issues with ASOS but it certainly will be my last given how horrendous it has been. For a multi billion pound company to not get the basics right is just embarrassing."

"February 02, 2021",1,Appalling customer service,"So my order hasn't arrived 8 days after it was due. All because the courier (Hermes) failed once again to deliver.I have no way to know what happened or where my parcel is, ASOS denied a replacement to my order (which was for a birthday last week) and made promises they actually won't keep. They keep on writing this CS cheap talk but won't actually act accordingly or efficiently. No commercial gesture offered, nothing, despite the fact that I have been paying the premier delivery for years and that 90% of the time they are just unable to fulfil the service they sell.I have been a customer for years, the problem always happens so I am giving up on ASOS."

I explained I had the matching top as it was a loungewear set. So I wasn’t going to return the trousers unless I could get another pair sent out - strangely the trousers happened to sell out just then. I wasn’t getting anywhere, the customer service was disappointing, I wasn’t offered the chance to speak to a manager and when I said I wanted to complain I was offered 20% off my next order!!!!!!!! WHAT!! Why would I spend more money at ASOS when you can’t even help me resolve this issue.I was prepared to send in photos of the faulty item but no, I was still being told to return the item!!! I’ve shopped at ASOS a very long time and I’m very disappointed that they don’t even have a complaints process.ASOS are obviously fine until you have a faulty item then they don’t wana help!!I won’t be shopping with them again and certainly wouldn’t recommend them."

I have made a claim using 'Resolver' as ASOS refuses to refund me my voucher and claims it has on my other vouchers (which I paid separately for and it is less than what I am owed) when I have sent proof this was not the case! This is not the first time. Please be warned as ASOS has one of the worst customer service and they don't even issue full refund if you purchase using any kind of voucher. They WILL cheat you out of it or send a voucher that is way less than what you spent! They would not be able to get away with this if you paid using paypal/bank and they have found a loophole to rip of loyal customers and I happened to fall into this trap TWICE! Fool me once, shame on you but I do not recommend ASOS at all. They are dishonest and they will keep telling you the same lie after chasing them on chat/resolver/emails. It's like talking to a computer not people!"

I contacted Hermes, I'm still waiting to hear back from them however I contacted ASOS through live chat. I think I was on the chat for all off 7 minutes, they are sending a replacement of my missing item by next day delivery all costs covered. They did offer a refund but as I need the item I requested a replacement. The girl Kimberly was very helpful and got the issue sorted within less than 10 mins when I'm still waiting to hear back from Hermes. Only thing I would say is I don't understand why companies still use Hermes as I have nothing but issues with them every time a parcel is being delivered. As far as customer service goes I would say they are one of the best. No issues or questioning they just got the problem sorted."

"February 02, 2021",1,Wrong item policy,"I wish I could give less than 1 star. I have never used ASOS before and won't again. I have received the completely wrong order. I ordered some beauty products and was sent some jeans, boots and a t shirt for some very tall woman. But in order to get my money back I have to repackage the items, arrange return and then wait 10 days for you to receive them?! Then wait another 10 days for my money back?! And you won't simply send out the correct item, no, i have to REORDER AND PAY AGAIN if I want it still?! What?!?!? So I have to wait twice as long and be doubly out of pocket because of a mistake ASOS made? That is utterly atrocious. Why can't my items be sent out immediately? These items I have no use for will be sent back when I have a moment as I have a toddler and full time job and we are on lockdown. But the hoops I have to jump through to get MY money back, is atrocious. What sort of policy is that?!"

I have spent lots of time and effort trying to communicate between ASOS customer care and Parcelpoint to establish the status of my return and refund. I have been very patient, but after more than 9 weeks waiting I am getting increasingly frustrated that I am still waiting for my refund.Today I have emailed twice and participated in an online chat with a customer care person. He informs me that he will organise the refund but it could take up to 10 days to appear in my account.Despite my patience, ASOS haven't once offered any form of compensation for the delay and I feel frustrated about the protracted nature of this issue.I will be reluctant to order online from ASOS again and will be sharing my experience with friends and discouraging them from using ASOS too."

They were fine in the beginning however after sending a screenshot of my bank accounts, being told I was refunded and waiting 10 business days I was told by them to call my bank account. WHAT?!?! If I send you a screenshot of my accounts why would I need to call my bank? They weren’t helpful at all and told be that I would need to wait another 72 hours. I told them I’m not sure why I wasn’t given the option to get a credit vs sending money back. Carla also repeated themself about 3 times for me to call my bank which was super frustrating and disappointing.  I also asked to speak to a manager and they refused. It was a terrible experience."

"February 02, 2021",1,Incompetence All Around,"I ordered four scarves from ASOS - received three of them and two items I didn’t order. While I planned to return the items I inadvertently received, I also was hoping that the correct item could be sent to me, negating the necessity of having to place another order and potentially incur a shipping charge. My experience with customer service has been sorely lacking. What should have been a quick email exchange has turned into a back and forth communication because no one will answer my questions directly. I was told that I would have to reorder my missing scarf myself because of a “security concern,” even after returning the items that were sent to me by mistake. Second, as of the writing of this review I cannot get a straight answer about whether I will have to incur a shipping charge when reordering my scarf due to their mistake (my original order came with free shipping). Not only did previous customer service reps fail to address my question head on, but the last one told me that she would have to get information validated before determining if the shipping cost would be covered. This should be a no brainer - OF COURSE it should be shipped free of charge; it was ASOS’ error. Assuming I can get my scarf with free shipping, I will never patronize this business again; I’m only pushing because I had my heart set on this scarf . . . hence the reason why I bought it. Just unacceptable."
"February 02, 2021",1,ASOS sent me the incorrect item,"ASOS sent me the incorrect item and instead of offering to resend the correct one, I was told I had to return the wrong item, wait for a refund and then re purchase the correct item. What a poor policy from such a large company."

A week later I inquired where is was and have not been emailed back since. Was sent an automated email saying ""Now your items have been delivered, how about a review?"" Definitely not how you should run a business. Ivy on the live chat was able to inform me it's now a lost package and 2/3 items have now went out of stock. One item being sent to me with next day delivery and refunded the 2 missing items. You guys need to work on communication when you have lost a package, awful. Don't advertise next day if you're too busy. I'd give 0 stars but Ivy was able to help me"

"February 01, 2021",1,Took payment and never sent order out.,"Waited for an order that should have arrived over a week ago until I decided it was time to get in contact with them to find out the whereabouts of my order. This order had been sat on the status that ASOS has sent it for a whole week, but when tracking via Hermes, they had not received it. I spoke to an advisor via the ASOS online chat to find out there had been a technical issue, therefore, my parcel had never actually left their warehouse. (They did not give this information up without me specifically asking them if I had even been sent anything). I then proceeded to question if I wouldn't have even been informed of this by the company, had I not been the one to contact the company myself. In which the response I got was ""sadly, yes"". I now have to wait an extra 3 days in order to receive a refund as the items I had originally ordered are now out of stock. Therefore, the company has been sat on my money for a total of over 2 weeks. I, reasonably, requested some kind of compensation, as I hadn't been offered anything of the sort so far. To then be continuously refused this as the debate went on. In conclusion, this company have taken my money for an order they never shipped out. Failed to notify me that there had been any issue with sending my parcel and would have held onto my money indefinitely, had I not contacted them myself. Poorly run business alongside poor customer service."

It's been over a week since placing my order and NO tracking information has changed or been updated.  When I started a chat with customer service, they told me they have little control or visibility of my product or its whereabouts once it leaves the warehouse. I find that unacceptable.  Hoping that my package arrives shortly. I understand shipment delays happen, especially in this climate with the pandemic. But saying ""your estimated shipping date is coming soon"" for over a week is unacceptable. Not even an estimation or update from warehouse to shipping facility."
"February 01, 2021",3,Ordered five tops,"Ordered five tops, three are fine, but the sizing of the other two are very disappointing and a  large rather than XL, why can't you get the sizing right? No point n returning them either, local charity shop will get them when they are allowed to open."

"February 01, 2021",1,"Absolutely Shocking ""Customer Service""!","If I could give ASOS ""Customer Care"" Service 0 rating I would, but I have to give them this undeserved one star to post this review.I have mistakenly received a voucher instead of a refund for a return and it took me over 3 months to get ASOS to finally refund it to my card. It has also been a nightmare getting ASOS to produce a returns label, which took 2 months itself and resulted in further headache. These countless useless interactions with ASOS ""Customer Service"" have been of no help, as ASOS kept repeating same complete lies over and over again for several months about how they are sorry and they will look into ""MY"" issue. This has been extremely stressful and affected my mental health. I will never ever shop with ASOS Australia again and would NOT recommend it to any of my friends. I have never had any issues of such sort with ASOS UK, as their Customer Service is the best one I have ever dealt with. ASOS Australia should be ashamed."

"February 01, 2021",1,Not fair customer service,Ordered a large jacket for partner as a gift and it’s too big (he is normally a large so can’t be true to size) I used a promo code and need to exchange this jacket for smaller size. No longer do exchanges so would have to buy it back but at full price which is quite a jump and the reason I purchased the jacket was because it was on offer. I asked if I could get a promo code to buy the smaller size and this was refused. I can no longer purchase a smaller size and miss out on this. Very unfair.

"February 01, 2021",1,This company is a complete sham,"This company is a complete sham . First of all my order arrived half open and with half my items missing including any paperwork  that had personal details on, which is concerning . For then for me to speak to 3 different people regarding this order before anything was actually done. I asked for a replacement that wasn’t done until 3 days later after 2 more conversations with different people. To receive my email finally after 3 days . To then get an email an hour later saying I’m being refunded the sale items  because the items are out of stock . Which this email I took it upon myself to check if the items where out of stock which in-fact they where still in stock on the website the only difference is that the prices have increased again for the products. Putting me into a situation if I still want theses items I will need to order again at a higher price. This has been disgusting and poor customer service. Ans I will not be forced into paying more for a item that was already processed and available. I will not be buying from here again."

When I got my package (after it being sent to another province, and lost for almost a week, finally delivered well past the expected delivery time) I had to pay $19.04 at my local post office. When I tried to get a refund, I was told it would not be possible. This is the first time I have ordered from ASOS and it will be the last. I now have had to pay over $40 for my item to be shipped to me from the US. I have had to pay less for shipping from Australia."

The joke is this same thing happened last time I ordered, it was even worse last time you guys didn't deliver as I actually had somewhere to go and outfits for an occasion. OH BUT THEY DIDN'T ARRIVE. Maybe focus on getting your current in house operations working properly before trying to buy Topshop etc. Otherwise YOU WILL GO THE SAME WAY ARCADIA DID. ASOS USED TO BE AMAZING!

It was a simple new return note request as my post office had closed without warning, the ASOS team at the weekend on messenger were not efficient at all at sorting this out, replies came at the end of the day when the drop off points were shut and my query was not resolved after two days of chasing. Finally contacted ASOS via their chat function on their website On Monday and it was sorted out by Ierico thankfully. If my request had been sorted out when I asked at the weekend, this could have been avoided. The weekend ASOS team on messenger really complicated matters and using different people to answer the same request was not good as they didn't read what was said in the exchange previously, I either got answers reiterated or they directed me to the returns policy or feedback form. Started to think I was talking to several different bots!"

Monday morning g the status of the order had been changed to ‘parcel returned to ASOS’. Somehow the order that had been delivered to me was now being sent back. No one had said anything to me or explained why. Till now I have no idea what happened and the order was cancelled even though I wanted to receive the goods.

The item didn't arrive, apparently ""It failed to leave the warehouse"" I then asked further questions and was told it was lost. I then asked for a refund but they has already started sending me a replacment I didn't want that! I asked for that to be canceled and refuneded. They said that had done this but no, 2 days later the item arrived ... I then had to return this as I no longer wanter the item. I returned this on the 18th January ... As of today (1st Febuary) No refund has been issued, they still haven't marked the return as recieved and I'm out of pocket for a month ... Now I'm not to fussed about the £75 it's more the fact I am a first time customer and had to contact them to tell them that my item had not left there warehouse! I don't understand why every time I ask them a question they respond with please wait 10 days for something to happen. I understand COVID is a thing and this my slow the process but this is no excuse for the poor customer service I have seen here."

"February 01, 2021",1,Horrible experience,"Horrible experience. They gave me a shipping label that was addressed to a man living in an apartment rather than to their warehouse. It then took TWO WEEKS for them to understand the problem and actually get me a correct shipping label, which should've been done in the first place. I was sent from person to person with every person not having a clue what I was talking about even though all of my messages were in the same e-mail chain. There were times where I had to e-mail the same message twice to even get a response in a timely manner. They then had the audacity to tell me I’d only receive an ASOS credit because it wasn’t returned in a timely manner, even though it was their fault that I wasn’t able to return in the first place... I literally created a return request the DAY I got the order. I’ve never been more frustrated in my life."

Help people would leave chats and not help me, and my emails since start of December have still not been answered! They still will not refund me, have my money and I feel as though they do not care about their customers-especially those who want their money back. ASOS obviously needs to invest more time into customer service. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE, as they send wrong sizes, never respond, and don't give u your money back. have spent COUNTLESS HOURSE ON CUSTOMER SERVICE!!-they are utterly useless they can't do anything can't give my money back. -Sincerely a very unhappy customer."
"February 01, 2021",1,My experience was not a pleasant one I…,My experience was not a pleasant one I reached out to chat with someone thinking they’d be helpful but instead they were disrespectful. The reason why I needed help was because I ordered something in a size that I immediately thought would not fit and I have been able to on another occasion to cancel and my plan was to reorder and it would not give me the option and then I thought I’ll get a hold of someone I’ll let them know what happened and hopefully they can help. Well I only wasted my time and on top of that I feel disrespected by this representative Edisondelos who basically said that because the error was not on their end there was nothing they can do about it. The fact that an employee who represents a company who makes money off selling items online would treat a paying customer that way just doesn’t make sense to me. I’ve been a customer for a long time i of course am not 100 percent on my sizes when it comes to ordering clothes online and I am human and I can change my mind does that make me wrong and that make it ok for this employee to basically tell me that I was the one who messed up so I pay for my mistake. I’m very insulted and I’m very dissatisfied I’m sure you have a lot of customer and I am just one more but I should be just as valuable.
"February 01, 2021",1,LIES on the website. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Ordered a jacket from ASOS. It was late to arrive, and when it did I was forced to pay duty even though there isn't supposed to be any duties on items below $150. I tried it on and it didn't fit. No problem, I thought. It's posted all over the website that ASOS accepts free returns. I go to return it, only to find out that by free they actually mean $22.40. I reached out to customer service via email and Twitter. No response (for over a month). I managed to get to chat with someone and they refused to help me in any way. They say they will only refund the cost of the coat, not shipping or duty. Not even a gift card! Total garbage. Completely unhelpful. They basically scammed me out of my money."

This has now been going on for 6/7 weeks and I still haven’t received a refund from a Christmas present purchased mid Dec!! But it’s ok they suggested this will be refunded by 17th Feb!! Im sorry but this is not good service!! I’m not holding my breath! Sorry ASOS but you have lost my business! Currently £106 out of pocket!!!
"January 31, 2021",1,Zero Stars!!,"Absolutely disgusting customer service. I have been waiting for an $80 refund since October 2020. Apparently the barcode they give you to return an item, they cant even track themselves? Constantly chasing them up to get an update and receiving the same email written word for word out of a book. I finally had someone tell me the refund will be processed and a week later someone emailed me back saying instead of a refund they will be issuing a voucher?! I was a massive fan of ASOS but never again. If you are returning anything pay extra for a tracked parcel bag! What an absolute waste of time"
"January 31, 2021",5,Great Customer Service,"Unfortunately, I had a problem with my order about a missing item.

"January 31, 2021",1,34 day wait on a next day delivery with terrible customer service,"I ordered an item on next day delivery, 17 days later I still had no item. Messaged the customer care team over 10 times throughout that period and no one issued me ang actual help, clearly kept passing on to a new member of the team each time; none of whom looked in to it and processed a new item or refund. When I did finally get through to someone helpful they said they’ll send a new item and that it could be another 17 days til I receive it. So in total 34 days for what should have been a 1 day delivery. No compensation offered, I had to repurchase the item, and at a higher cost and am now having to wait for the refund on the difference. Absolutely no help whatsoever given, clearly no care about the customer service they are offering - at all. Beyond dissatisfied."

"January 31, 2021",1,TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!,ASOS sent me the wrong item. I purchased the item when they had a promotional discount of 20 percent on. I asked the customer service team whether they could exchange the item for the correct one I purchased or if they could provide me with a one time discount code so I could re-order the correct item if exchange was not available. I was told they can't exchange and I am not entitled to the discount price anymore. They couldn't honour the price even though it was ASOS who made the mistake.

Months ago, it was possible to order things from different countries. For instance, UK ASOS store. So, i used to have so much more offer. But now, even when I'm shopping from the portuguese store, when I'm checking out, I get the message that more than half of the items cannot be delivered to my country. This is ridiculous. If you can't do the delivery don't even show them to me. It's not like I have many houses abroad, where I can send the stuff I wsnt to buy. This is really frustrating and I totally loose the interest in buying stuff from you guys, at all. I am really sorry that this has happened. I wish I could have the ASOS of like 2 years ago."

They also offer Klarna as a payment option, so you don’t have to pay straight away if you don’t want to.Returns are fairly easy, however they’ve stopped their ‘print at home’ option for returns labels, so if your local post office/ drop off point isn’t able to print your label then it can be a bit of a pain.

Beyond that, I’ve spoken with customer service 7+ times for help with tracking and I’ve been given nothing but the run around. Consistently asked to go above and beyond on my end to find this package. This is the worst experience I’ve ever dealt with."
"January 30, 2021",2,My 4 month long refund struggle,"I ordered some clothes at the end of August, and returned 1 item in September. After about a month, I still hadn’t received my refund. I sent the Contact Us form a message and had a lot of trouble actually getting helped. I spent the next FOUR months trying to get in touch with ASOS support and had continually been getting “we are very busy” messages back in response (if I received a response at all). I had almost given up, but decided to send one more message in late January - and this time I had luck. Finally received my refund notice (let’s hope it actually shows up by next week) and uff da...what a process. It was so quick and helpful when they finally got back to me, but why did it take 4 months? Might think twice before placing an order again, which is a shame because I enjoy their product. :("
"January 30, 2021",1,Horrible Order and Customer Service Experience,"There needs to be a hotline to assist customers. Apparently, if I send an email I can get a call back, and yet, I haven't. I'm tired of chatting and getting nowhere. No one can offer solutions and I have no idea who I'm dealing with. After a great experience ordering previously, I am floored that you all sent this package via Pitney Bowes and it can't be tracked. It's, frankly, unacceptable. This partnership you have with them needs to be suspended, unless you all can improve upon the shipping method. And, to further exacerbate the situation, everyone has suggested that I check with my local post office, which is ludicrous when I don't have a tracking number. Nor should it be my responsibility. Please get it together, ASOS. I'd hate to stop shopping there."

When I reached out about this issue, I was told that they could not send me my correct item in exchange for the incorrect one I had received. Instead, they informed me I would have to send back my incorrect item, await my refund, and reorder my correct item myself. I haven't received my refund yet, and the correct item has long since been out of stock. I did everything right on my part, and ASOs has not made the effort on their end to fix THEIR mistake. The only solution I was given was to choose to be notified when my correct item was back in stock, and they would honor the original price I paid. However, there is no option to be notified if an item is completely out of stock. They were no help at all. I am deeply unsatisfied."

"January 30, 2021",1,"Poor service, no communication or refund","I had placed an order back in December that never turned up. After looking at my tracking it had said there was an issue with my order and to contact ASOS.ASOS had ever reached out to me to make me aware of this situation so I had to get I  touch. There is no clear way to contact them so i eventually found their instant chat to query my order to be told they didn't know what happened and so I would be issued I refund and an email would be sent to start this.This never happened and so resulted in another 2 chats with no outcome. I am now on my Forth chat to ask why I have had no confirmation and had no firm answer.In this chat I was then told that the refunds policy has changed amd been extended due to a high volume of queries and I would be waiting until next month for any confirmation of a refund. I find it ridiculous that again there is no update on my refund unless I query it, also very convenient that the refund policy has suddenly changed despite me complaining well before this.I have always loved the items on ASOS but seen a huge change in customer service. Really disappointed and hoping I will eventually recieve my refund.I also paid for premium delivery months ago and can say I cant remember a time I ever recieved my items the next day like I should.Very quick to take money but provide no product or service."

Since they changed to paperless returns I have had issues with three high value refunds.The first one took months to resolve, I sent a number of emails, messages that went unacknowledged. Eventually I was refunded and I only recieved an apology when I asked for one. The second and third orders took two months. The third was refunded incorrectly and again I sent numerous emails as the contact now service was unavailable and yet again had no response to them. When the contact now service is availabke the reps told me they cannot access the returns you create on the system so it makes listing the items quite time consuming. When I asked for the contact address to make a complaint, I was advised to write my feedback on here! This isn't a complaint site.. the customer service at the moment is very poor.

"January 30, 2021",5,Always the best customer service tbh,Always the best customer service tbh. Only defeated by Amazon. Nevertheless always get prompt response whether I reach out via email or Twitter! Thanks Temar for handling my query even though I sent it out of hours.
"January 30, 2021",1,UNIMPRESSED,"UNIMPRESSED! Ordered my first ever ASOS order. My estimated delivery was Wednesday, nothing arrived. My online tracker then stated delivery for Thursday, to which I waited patiently. Thursday evening came and still nothing, then I received an email thanking me for my return items and that a refund was on its way.I DID NOT RECEIVE MY ITEMS FOR THEM TO BE RETURNED. I emailed to ask what had gone on and was given reasons to why this would have happened... none of which made sense to my situation! Even online tracking still stated it was out for delivery and never once changed to “delivered”. After going back and forth numerous times with Customer Services and who pretty much repeated themselves, I was told to just reorder the items. On looking into this, two of my seven items were out of stock in my size! I think this is absolutely appalling and no one seems to care about what’s happened. Talking to Customers Services is like talking to a brick wall, none of this is my fault, yet I’m the one to lose out."
"January 30, 2021",1,Extremely poor customer experience,I ordered an ASOS branded jacket size medium. It was too smallGollowing asos size guide I ordered 6 jackets size Large. When the arrived they were way too big. Obviously dissapointed with the difficulty I thought it’s ok because I can easily go for smaller again Even though all the items are available on the website and the size chosen was due to their guide  ASOS will not honour the original price from 3 days ago. It cost ASOS the manpower to pack plus postage to provide a bad customer experience where as if they honoured the original price I would have purchased all 6. Poor customer experience and terrible business decision.
"January 30, 2021",5,Customer Service,The customer service is great.
"January 30, 2021",1,Nightmare!,Nightmare!! I paid the subscription what a rip off. It’s not next day it’s might be next week.Loss of hassle with crap customer service
"January 30, 2021",1,Never received jacket and NO REFUND,I never received my jacket. It was never delivered. The delivery company stated they never received it. Now ASOS will NOT refund or “reship” my order. It was $150 during a pandemic. I needed a jacket for the actual winter. Due to the pandemic it was very difficult to communicate with anyone about this issue and now ASOS is saying because it’s past 30 days-it’s MY FAULT!!??? This is terrible TERRIBLE SERVICE! $150 is not nothing and to have NO JACKET and NO REFUND??! Horrible! I will never buy from here again! NO STARS IF THAT WAS AN OPTION!
"January 30, 2021",5,Accidentally typed in wrong email…,Accidentally typed in wrong email address - twice!  ASOS easily sorted the problem.

There is no effective way to contact them to escalate a complaint. I will never shop with them again. I hope they read this message and reach out to me, but I suspect they won’t."
"January 30, 2021",5,Great service,"Great service, quick and responsive to resolve an error with my order."
"January 30, 2021",1,Useless service when parcel has gone missing,I have been in contact with ASOS multiple times now regarding a missing parcel. Hermes had marked the parcel as delivered and the courier hadn't actually delivered the parcel. They have been so useless in helping me out as they keep saying they'll investigate and end up not getting back to me. One live chat operator even went and ended the chat on me when I wasn't even finished speaking to her.
"January 30, 2021",5,Very helpful,"Very helpful, quick to answer and resolved my query."
"January 30, 2021",1,Palmed off by ASOS Customer Care,"It’s incredible that company as big as ASOS will do the bare minimum to help a customer after feeding them their money. To keep a long story short, I made the mistake of ordering a couple of items for myself on 27/1/2021, due to be delivered the following day 28/1/2021 by Hermes. Never do I usually have any problems with ASOS or Hermes however, due to no update on my tracking which was highly unusual I decided to do a little investigation of my own. ASOS claimed they prepared my order for delivery and had sent it however, Hermes are stating they’re still waiting on to receive the parcel. It has been a solid 3 days with no movement on tracking and all the ASOS CC team could give me was ‘Hermes are experiencing delays at the moment’. As true as I’m sure that is, the problem does not lie with Hermes but infact ASOS who are currently sitting on my parcel and holding my money. I have been advised to wait a further 4 days past my delivery due date to which then they may/may not offer a replacement or a refund. If they were actually willing to chase the item up I’m certain the problem would have been solved days ago.If they didn’t have the items in stock I’d have rather they had cancelled my order. This experience has tainted my opinion on ASOS and future purchases from the brand. For now I just have to sit and wait and continue to chase, thanks for nothing ASOS."
"January 30, 2021",1,Pretty dreadful- received the…,Pretty dreadful- received the completely incorrect items!
"January 30, 2021",1,Company managed by clowns,"Terrible, disgusting customer service. I pay for next day delivery and it’s been three weeks and I still haven’t received my order. When I chased this up I was assured I would be contacted within 48 hours with a resolution, instead I got an email from an even worst company Hermes saying they have delivered the parcel. Clearly this was delivered to an invisible location. I then chased this up with Hermes who advised me to chase up with ASOS. I did this and was assured once again this would be resolved in 48 hours. Four days later no reply so I chase up again to be informed that the parcel has been delivered and to check my property. Absolute brains of the country keeping businesses going we can all be reassured that ASOS is as useless as the company they use to deliver. Will not be reviewing my premier account with ASOS nor will I order through them again."

And customer service just answered me to send the boots back! I will have to pay more for sending them back than the original price of the boots so they can send them to another victim customer. These boots are worse in worse condition than those found in thrift stores."

"January 30, 2021",1,Poor customer service and no refund.,I had been trying to contact asos via email and chat for a month before getting through to someone in regards to my return. Unfortunately as I never received a returns receipt I will not be getting my refund as my item has appeared to go missing. Can’t give any further stars because a) it took me over a month to even speak to someone in asos b) I think the label provided for the return should be trackable so that when a customer returns an item they can’t be refused a refund if asos doesn’t receive it and c) I am down in money both for the item and for returning it - which I offered a screenshot of my banking app to prove the return.
"January 30, 2021",1,Good for nothing is exactly this!,"Bought a good for nothing men’s coat L (tall) from ASOS,  inside lining item faulty, stitching not very well made inside. Coat fits perfectly however since lining faulty worn a few times requested return and replace. Customer service shocking, no replacement for same price I paid offered. Got told to send to menders wasting my time. Won’t be buying from there again!"
"January 30, 2021",5,Rearranged method of return,I had a query about returning my items to the post office as they issue a small charge to print returns labels but I was helped by Curtis who was able to arrange an alternative method of returning that was completely free via Hermes collection.

"January 30, 2021",1,Going in Circles,"Going in CirclesI have been working with them for over a week now to get my student discount and it keeps going in circles. I provided them my information 3 different times. Sent confirmation email of acceptance in school, most recent transcript and two different university emails. They said a confirmation email would be sent within 24hrs on Tuesday 1/27/21, because everything was approved. Contacted today and they said they can't find me in the system."
"January 30, 2021",1,I will never buy with asos again,"I bought a few items and after using one of them it broke in different parts. I informed asos in their chat and one of their representatives informed me that they would send a refund and I would receive my money in 5-6 days. After 20 days I didn't receive anything, so I sent an email and never received a response. I decided to contact them again this time by chat and they informed they decided not to return the money and denied this request as 50 days passes after the purchase of the item. I never received any email letting me know about this decision. The communication between the company and the client is really poor, and they should train better their workers so they wouldn't promise things that they don't know."

When I contacted customer service, they told me that I should send the pants back of I want a refund and place another order to figure out myself if the item I ordered two weeks ago is even in stock. Instead of checking and then sending me what I ordered which would make me more than happy to reintroduced these unwanted pants, they want me to go through these crazy hoops to get the same shirt I ordered IF it is in stock which they didn’t even check when I contacted them.

The first two times I was told to wait 2 days and if I heard nothing contact customer care again. Now I’m having to wait another 17 days for a replacement which may or may not include my items depending on stock availability. I’m am very disappointed and unhappy with the situation. I normally love asos and have previously found the company to be reliable, but I am wildly frustrated by this order. I am going to be less likely to reorder from asos after this experience."

I have waited for an email but nothing has come through, they have ruined my gift and also don’t have the decency to try rectify the issue in any kind of hurry. I’m disgusted as a first time costumer here I would advise others to avoid if possible because they don’t care about the customers they just want your money and once they have it they don’t really care about it afterwards.

I talked to support in chat and they said they will investigate it with DHL. After couple of days they blocked my account and said that they will not be able to refund anything. But 2 days later I get a message from ASOS, that DHL finished their investigation and parcel was actually lost so they offered me refund or replacement, that was on 21st of January, I answered back to them same day and what do you think? I still didnt get any answer, they just telling me to wait or whatever else, my account is still blocked, and sometimes in chat there is just a robot with same message, no matter what you type."

"January 29, 2021",1,Over 10 emails just to return an item,"It's impossible to get a straight answer from Asos customer service. I was sent the wrong size of an item and when trying to return, the ""paperless drop off service"" that Asos uses to claim being more environmentally friendly told me I needed to have a return label printed. I know this is not Asos's fault but as this is the only drop point in my area, I emailed to ask for an alternative method of returning as there is nothing that I could print should I want to (i have a printer at home, just give me whatever it is I need to print). Each email is responded to by a different person with conflicting information and without reading the previous emails exchanged. I was told I could return via CTT correios, then when I asked how to create a new return from a return that was already open I was told I could not return via CTT? Which is it? I was sent links that had expired, and now I expect they will tell me if I ever manage to return my item that it is outside the returns window, when I have been emailing them since mid december. Its not worth buying from them if the process to return is so disorganised. Especially as I need to return the item in the first place because they sent me THE WRONG SIZE."

"January 29, 2021",2,Next day delivery turns into 2+ weeks,"Next day delivery turns into 2+ weeksPlaced an order for next day delivery. 1.5 weeks later and multiple (slow, laggy) chats with customer care, it was discovered the item was lost in transit. I agreed to have a replacement item sent. Now, 2 weeks later I had received no updates in regards to the replacement item. Apparently it takes 5 days to process a replacement, but a standard order can be packaged and shipped within a day?! There seems to be a major disparity here between standard orders and customer care orders. Surely the two should be treated the same. Very disappointed with the service and customer care. The representatives I spoke to were nice, but the process for refunds/replacement is unacceptable. Very disappointed as ASOS would typically be my first choice in online retailers."
"January 29, 2021",1,waste of time,"They did NOT send my order TWICE! Just returned money with no explanation.  Third and forth time they send my parcels to wrong PUDO point - 200km away from actual address. Customer service is sooo kind but absolutely useless solving the problem. Local carrier insists they already got this WRONG adress from sender. Not going to order anything else, it is waste of time and nerves."

"January 29, 2021",1,Got rudely cut off by customer care…,"Got rudely cut off by customer care when asking where my order was, that has not been delivered. I was asking for a refund of the postage at the least, and they abruptly ended the conversation telling me they were going to disconnect, which would have been fine if I had been horrible to them, but I hadn't. All I was asking for was for a refund of posting because the item hasn't been delivered in the time they said it would."
"January 29, 2021",3,It took me almost two days to receive a solution,"I,at first chatted with someone called Kristine, they could not help me but they tried at least.    Then i chatted with Mikko, they just ignored me.   Then i chatted with Dan, they really helped me and tried solving the issue.  Then i chatted with Venus, they solved the issue or at least gave a solution. but i had to restart the chat twice before u received an answer"

"January 29, 2021",1,Horrible customer care,Several attempts to reach customer care to get a refund for and item that asos wrongly sent to me. I provided all the necessary details and still have not gotten a refund. I ask for help repeatedly and get no response. ASOS sent the wrong item and I cannot get my money back. I paid a lot in customs and I won’t be getting that back either. At these unprecedented times I expected more from ASOS as I am a long time loyal customer.
"January 29, 2021",5,Very responsive and helpful,The customer service was very helpful and sorted out my problem very quickly.
"January 29, 2021",2,Your customer experience is awful,"Your customer experience is awful. You dont take any responsability for the carrier that provides you the returns. Also, you reply with a polite nothing-said information that is useless.This is terrible. Several last times i had problems returning parcel, i mean it wasnt track any way and this time is the last time buying from asos. I will have a very long break from it and also i will give bad feedback about your service anywhere i canShame on you."
"January 29, 2021",1,Colours transferring on everything!,"Brought pjs, washed in accordance to the washing instructions. I’ve been wearing it this week only to realise the colour has transferred onto my sofa, dressing gown and bed sheets. Absolutely unacceptable."
"January 29, 2021",1,ASOS non delivery.,"First of all ASOS get a phone number. Apparently you already have human customer service agents. Email and online chat is tedious and extremely time consuming when you have an issue and want it resolved quickly.I ordered a jacket on the 25/01/2021. Estimated delivery 28/01/2021. On the 28/01/2021 I received no delivery.Recived an email on the 29/01/2021 at 02:30 saying a refund had been issued.Why did I not receive my order?Wasted an hour of my time trying to get in contact with ASOS from 7-8am on the 29/01/2021. Sent 2 emails which look like they never sent as I didn't receive any confirmation email that they had been.Tried their online chat and gave the assistant (Lordeth) as much information as possible including screenshots of all emails sent from ASOS (order, despatch and refund email) that ended with me being told to log into my account and reorder if the items are still available. Are you kidding me????So I have to wait 7-10 days for the refund to hit my account then IF the product is still available try again and possibly run the risk of a repeat performance.I have ordered from ASOS before so the possible reasons for the mystery return from the online chat assistant I refuse. Such as being unable to find my address (REALLY! a courier in this day and age unable to find an address with the likes of sat navs and google maps) there were people in my house the entire day so there is really no excuse as to why I did not receive my delivery. In fact 2 deliveries from Amazon arrived on the 28th.On a separate note it makes me laugh how companies can take money instantly from customers accounts but refunds take days."

Norjannah answered all my long questions and addressed all my concerns about the scarce material going to waste. I'm sure I must have been annoying, but they still assured me it would not be wasted. The customer service exceeded my expectations, and I'm very grateful. Norjannah is the reason I'm going to continue shopping with ASOS. :)"

"January 29, 2021",1,I am VERY disappointed with Asos for…,I am VERY disappointed with Asos for deducting postage costs from my gift voucher instead of the extra money I paid with PayPal. I got in touch with someone in the chat room who could not help. Come on Asos... are you not making enough money out of people already during lockdown??? This gift voucher was a Christmas present from my son and you have just taken almost 1/4 of it in postage!! Shame on you Asos!!!!

Late delivery, poor quality product and terrible customer service. I was actually going to buy the same item that was defective AGAIN, hoping that another one will arrive in a better condition. All I asked is to give me a new promo-code, so I pay the same price as I paid in a first place, but they said no. For the sake of $20 they just lost a few hundred $$ sale and another customer. After dealing with so-called “customer service” I decided to return everything I bought and never shop there again. Seems like customer support employees are doing everything to put the company down."

"January 29, 2021",1,ASOS is rubbish,ASOS is rubbish. I opened an account and ordered an item with a £50 voucher I got for my birthday. They emailed me back and said they found suspicious activity on my account so they have cancelled my order and blocked my account. They are extremely difficult to contact and it looks like they have robbed my £50 voucher. I wouldn’t recommend using them at all.

I then waited another 2 days and checked the delivery status and YOUR site said that ALL 4 items were delivered. I then checked all my outdoor cameras making sure an item wasn’t stolen and come to fine out after talking to your customer service representative, you never even shipped the item.. but you literally sent me confirmation that it was delivered. So after finding out it was NEVER even delivered, your rep says the items are out of stock and another doesn’t have the size I ordered... now I’m told a refund should be processed soon and to be on the look out for a refund after 5 days.... so not only did you take my money for a item you didn’t have but you told me it was delivered and made me chase it down to then get a refund a week later and a link to write this story... yeah 1 star"
"January 29, 2021",1,The advisor I spoke to was more than…,"The advisor I spoke to was more than helpful, that was not my issue. My issue is with the fact that I ordered a full tracksuit sold as a set, and I only received one part of the tracksuit, the track bottoms. ASOS are saying as this query has been left open, they cannot do anything? I do not feel it is morally correct to charge customers for the product and then not deliver. I also have raised multiple queries and complaints over the last few months and with COVID and work and moving house, I have not had a chance to keep chasing this issue. But Klarna are now requesting the money and I wanted this issue to be sorted by yourselves before having to raise yet another query with them."
"January 29, 2021",1,My order had the wrong address and the…,My order had the wrong address and the only advice I was given was to read the policies and review address before finalizing an order. The site automatically changed my address and there was no remedy. I was told I have to wait and see if the order is returned to them. The I was told to go to the wrong address to pick up my parcel. The address that's on file doesn't exist so I was told I'm assed out with no other options. I used afterpay for my order so I'll be paying for something I won't receive. So thanks for nothing!!
"January 29, 2021",1,Outraged and appalled!!!!!!!!!,"i ordered items which i intended to be Christmas presents and they never showed up. I then proceeded to get in contact with ASOS to be told it would be looked in to with 48hours. I heard nothing so got back in touch again was told to check for these missing items. The items still have not been delivered was then told to leave the order number and include what was missing. Yet again still heard nothing and get the same response each time going round in circles. I appreciate response times our longer, but the clear lack of communication makes a mockery of the company. This is a frustrating and a stressful situation as the items were expensive and to make matters worst ASOS are sending me emails to see if i want to review the items. How can i review items i have not received? Thoroughly disappointed and will not be purchasing from this company again. I would not waste your time as the customer service is so poor!!!!!"
"January 29, 2021",4,No complaints,I've bought a few things from here over the years and always been impressed with speed of delivery.Never had an issue so no complaints. I wish they would have a few more bargains though.

"January 28, 2021",1,The customer service representative…,The customer service representative randomly ended the chat without addressing my concern.
"January 28, 2021",1,Keeping me in the dark is ANNOYING,"I was supposed to receive my package on 01-28, but it did not arrive and every time I check “track package” it takes me to Pitney Bowes website where there is only a tracking number but no other information. It just says “we will have a delivery date for you soon”. No info about the whereabouts of my package. I contacted PB, who told me to contact ASOS because they claimed they did not ship my package. When I contacted ASOS, they told me to contact USPS, who also said they didn’t have my package.  I have NO ideas who is shipping my package, where it is, or when it will arrive. I needed the dress for an even on Saturday, 01/30, but not it will not get here in time. I live in a city with very little good shopping options, and being a size 14, it is even harder for me to find clothes in store. Now it is way too late to order another item and ASOS has been NO HELP at all. I spent over 3 hours trying to find my package today and still have no clue where it is. I am BEYOND frustrated with the service I have received. They claim they do “everything they can” to make your experience a good one but it sure doesn’t seem like it. Also it’s very frustrating to me that ASOS does not have a customer service phone number where I can speak to a human being. They only have a chat, which is SO slow. Each response from the service representative takes about 5 minutes, and they seem to go in circles with their automated messages, never really trying to answer your actual questions. I’m so annoyed an disappointed that I will not have an outfit for this event. I have no idea what I will wear to it now."
"January 28, 2021",2,I'm happy with the service from ASOS…,I'm happy with the service from ASOS and the response from their Customer Care Team but this wasn't adhered to. Promises weren't followed through. The I spoke with Leizl on live chat who just wasn't like the standard of previous advisors and ASOS customer service.  All he wanted to do was argue nor help me!

"January 28, 2021",1,Shocking and unhelpful customer service…,Shocking and unhelpful customer service - Asos took the payment twice from my account but no order confirmation. Tried to get help on their live chat and was told to contact after 24 hours. The 20% discount i was trying to use has now expired also and the items are low in stock so waiting another 24 hours is not going to do anything to help me.
"January 28, 2021",5,Helpful and very polite,Worthwhile chat with Gracielle. Thanks for your help.
"January 28, 2021",1,Refusal to apply a code that didn't go through at checkout.,COntacted directly after making an order as an order code hadn't been applied. Customer service was useless and refused to apply the code to my order and credit me the amount. I contacted within hours of making the order when I realised the code hadn't gone through.

There seemed to be nothing that customer services could do to help me with this"
"January 28, 2021",1,I’d give no star if I could,"I’d give no star if I could. This company is trash. My order was returned to shipper before even making it close to my destination. I asked multiple times about my order being returned before it was actually received and refunded by asos and multiple times I was told to disregard that notification and that I should expect my order to still be delivered. I nearly had to pry accurate info from customer service to actually investigate and look into my order because it was no longer able to be tracked. Finally, after once more being given inaccurate info the customer service rep lets me know the order was returned. Overall horrible experience. Do better."
"January 28, 2021",1,Asos CRAP!!!,Never use this site. So called promotion codes. Never work and customer services couldn't give a flying foot about customers. Promise to rectify errors and glitches but you never hear from them. Waste of time. My suggestion use zalando or any other online clothing company.

"January 28, 2021",1,Poor delivery and poor customer service,"The delivery driver so called tried to attempt delivery yesterday and clearly lied about trying as no one knocked on the door or rung the bell, I havent left the flat in over 2 weeks and there are 3 other people living in the house. Also said they left a card? Where is that as they didn't put it through my door or left it at the gate. Also, its 45 mins over the hour slot I was given and still no delivery today. The response in this complaint I made was so basic and automatic. What do I get for all this hassle?"
"January 28, 2021",1,I placed an order on 1/1/21 estimated…,"I placed an order on 1/1/21 estimated date of delivery was 1/11/21. I did not receive my order. I contacted customer service. They asked me to wait until 1/21/20. I still did not receive my order. They asked me to verify my address, to check if it was left in a “safe” location outside my home, to check with all those who live in my household, to check with the post office. I did all that. I did not get my order. They finally agreed to refund me but they are only partially refunding me. They are still charging me for shipping for a package that I never received. How do I know they ever even shipped my order? The tracking information they provided to Pitney Bowes has no update. When I type in the tracking number they provided it states “no package with that tracking number found”. Why do I have to pay for shipping on a package that i never received? This was my first time shopping with ASOS and the last. I will not be recommending ASOS to anyone I know ever. Worst experience online shopping ever. Customer service just kept giving me the runaround and saying their hands were tied and they couldn’t do anything about it. That because it’s a carrier issue they can’t refund me the shipping. If it’s a carrier issue, why isn’t the carrier being charged instead of me? I think I’m being scammed and they probably never even shipped my order and are putting the blame on a carrier who conveniently is unable to track packages."
"January 28, 2021",1,I made an order that got delivered…,"I made an order that got delivered while I was at work. By the time I got home it was gone. I checked the picture that DPD took and they'd left it on my neighbours doorstep. My neighbours are denying seeing it so I can only assume it was taken by a passerby or my neighbours are lying and have kept the parcel. Either way I haven't received it and I contacted asos who said that there's nothing they can do as DPD have said that it was delivered successfully!! Even though there is physical evidence that they didn't even deliver it to an actual person and left it outside without my consent, they're still refusing to replace the items. Even though it's literally the law for them to take responsibility. So I'm now doing a chargeback with my bank. Disgusting company who would prefer their loyal customers be stressed and out of pocket over take responsibility. I made monthly orders with them for years but after this I won't be ordering from them again."

Their response was that I would need to take delivery, then send the items back for a refund, then reorder and apply the code. Very customer and emissions friendly!!!!!I asked how to complain about this and they gave me the link to Trustpilot! So they are outsourcing their complaints procedure to the public, and not dealing with them at all internally. Trustpilot shows that they have not responded to any negative comment in over 12 months!"
"January 28, 2021",1,A customer service advisor KrissyAnn Not good. One star is too much for the service,"A customer service advisor KrissyAnn is so rude on the chat and does not want to help at all for anything. I am keep asking if she can track my parcel delivery but she just refused and ask me to wait until 10pm to wait. I told her that the address is of the office and it will be closed after 6 but she is not bother about that rather she was just making excused that she does not have a system to check all that. When I asked if you ca connect me to supervisor then she brutally said no... and keep avoiding my request about finding out the details on my parcel which was almost £200Looks like ASOS has employed someone who does not care at all about company nor customer service. I chat with her for almost 20 minutes but all the time he or She comes with answer no. Honestly, he or she is just too rude.On the other hand. Company claim to delivery and dispatch the parcel via tracked service, I spent almost £200 and there is not delivery information or tracking. No clue, when will it come , and who will be delivering it. Just keep wait and wait.It’s not a great experience and one start is too much.. I have to contact my credit card company to stop the payment."

Told me in order to get a replacement/refund they would need a written report from FedEx and to give them three days to investigate. That was five days ago and I haven’t heard from them again.

"January 28, 2021",1,Appalling Service,"I placed an order which never turned up. I tried to email customer services twice but received no response. I then used the live chat and was told I needed to wait 48hrs for them to contact Hermes about my missing parcel. I waited over 48hrs but received no response from them. I then used the live chat again and was told that the issue had only just been logged despite me having waited over 48hrs and Hermes hadn't responded to them. This second employee then told me that he would just offer me a replacement or refund. I asked if the replacement would arrive via next-day deliver and he assured me that this was the case, therefore I chose to ask for a replacement. Had I know that 2 days later I would still be waiting for the replacement having not even received the email confirmation that I was told to expect, I would've asked for a refund and ordered a replacement next-day delivery as this would've arrived within the time constraints that I made clear to them multiple times throughout our communications and was reassured I didn't need to worry about. I then used the live chat for a third time, only to be told that I would need to wait 4 days for email confirmation and then my order would be sent next-day delivery! At this point I asked for a refund as their complete disregard for the important time constraints I had (and made very clear!) caused me to run out of time. Throughout my communications with ASOS I was patronised and told not to stress and worry as they had it under control for me, when in reality they never did. I have been a very loyal ASOS customer for years and have had nothing but amazing things to say about them, but this experience has left me extremely upset and disappointed. This will make me consider twice about shopping here for anything of importance."

Apparently the other 5 trousers were ‘sold out’..... so.... how could I even have paid for them in the first place?! The 1 trouser I received was bad quality so I returned it. Within a week I received my money back for this return yet after almost 1 month I haven’t got my refund of the other never-seen 5 trousers!!! Emailed with the customer care but they keep insisting they transferred the money without sending me any transaction proof, while I even send them proof of my account to show I never got back the money. Now I’m missing €183,90 for trousers that I’ve never seen because the ASOS system SUCKS!!!! Customer care literally couldn’t care less"

Once the missing 12.00 refund has been received in our Bank we will close the ASOS account & NEVER order from ASOS again. Pathetic service."
"January 28, 2021",1,Disappointed,"I sent a top back, unused and in a perfect condition, however I had the top sent back to me saying it was used and unsuitable. I got in touch with ASOS twice before I heard back from them over this issue.

However, two of my items including a pair of trainers have been quite blatantly stolen by the courier (Hermes), the parcel has been opened and then taped up. When I asked to get a replacement I was told that I can’t get one because they’re sold out in my size. I now have to wait five working days for them to process a refund, and then another five working days for them to credit my account. Why should I have to wait two weeks when I am not at fault? I suggest ASOS stop using Hermes and review this system."

"January 28, 2021",1,Disappointed Ex-Loyal Customer,I have been a customer of ASOS for years and spent thousands on their website for the past 10 years. However I won’t be shopping there anymore. Their customer service is shocking. The last item I received from them didn’t have a label and looked used. There was a hole in the shirt where the label looked it used to be attached. The shirt was £65 so not cheap. I was told to re-order by their customer service team only for that order to be cancelled without any contact from ASOS. After contacting their customer care team I was told they didn’t know why it was cancelled but could be a warehouse issue and they were trying to help me out by refunding me with no contact as to why? Very poor service. This isn’t the first time I’ve been sent an item by ASOS in a bad condition. A similar incident happened last year. The customer service has dropped massively since 2020. I would avoid. I’m now awaiting for my refund for the used shirt. Hopefully there will be no issues with this.

"January 28, 2021",1,Terrible returns process,"I have been a customer of ASOS in Australia and then the US for a number of years, and sadly I won't be using them again. I ordered a jacket on Jan 3, the package didn't arrive until the 17th, not their fault, but then I realised they had sent me a completely different product (pants instead of a jacket). This was really frustrating. But then the customer service that followed made it even worse. Despite it being the mistake of ASOS, I had to organise a return and take it back to the post office before they would action anything. More time wasted. Then, despite confirming they have received the product, 'processing' can take up to 10 days before I can get my refund. I still haven't been refunded. IF I get the refund, it will be a full month from the day I initially ordered the jacket - despite it being their fault. By the way, the product I wanted is now out of stock ... which they didn't tell me, I had to do another search.In terms of the process, ASOS refused to help outside of the rigid structure of this terrible process. Every time I sent an email to support, a different person responded with the same templated process. They wouldn't check to see if they could find and send out the original jacket that I ordered, they wouldn't do anything else to fast track the process.I don't normally do these negative reviews, but wanted to warn others about this experience."

God forbid this ever happens to me again. Just stinks because I love your products but this experience is too ridiculous."

I tried to get this arrange via the chat service however 3 different days 3 different advisors and 3 different answer. Firstly was told that it was a mistake and a refund will be arranged immediately however this didn’t happen so was then told that I have to wait 4 weeks before they can do anything and now being told to contact them in 2 days and they will manually arrange the refund. Absolute joke! They’ve clearly received the order back as they have refunded me for everything but one item and now sending me on a loop to get my money back.

Over two weeks when I’ve paid for prime next day delivery (purchased with this order). When I request a refund of this I am told this cannot be done?

"January 27, 2021",1,TERRIBLE customer service!,"I purchased 3 items - one was a pair of converse chucks which I have worn for 30 years. I ordered my size 7. Converse is different than other shoe brands in that whether womens or mens it's standard sizing is mens then there is a sub sizing of the corresponding womens size. I have always worn a mens 7 and have purchased these dozens of times from many vendors. The reviews said women were receiving HUGE shoes so I assumed it was the standard converse sizing (mens) being used so I ordered the 7. When it came it was a mens 5. Wrong size - I was very surprised, I felt like the site led me to this confusion by no fault of my own. I had to return and wanted to rebuy. When I placed my original order I added extra items to get up to a certain discount threshold. When I returned the shoes you bumped all the other items up to full price and refused to offer the full original order discount when I reorder of the shoes. I would never have purchased all those items at full price. I feel ripped off! ""Ian"" the chat customer service agent was not at all helpful - offered no solutions and cut off the chat while I was still engaged with him. The chat was at 12:20ish pm PST 1/27. This is horrible customer service - I am a return customer and I will never order with you again. This is so sub standard to even the most basic good customer service principals. Is this how you do business? Is Ian representative of the quality of your customer care team? I'm so disappointed. Buyers beware of all the tiered discounting - even if it's not your mistake that you have to return they will take away all your discounts and you'll end up overpaying."

One of which was received in the first half of the order. The second item was part of the second half of my order. As of now I have only been refunded for the first item. I spent 45 minutes explaining this to an advisor who didn't understand what I was talking about and stated that they couldn't continue with the query unless I could confirm that I didn't receive the second half of the order. He had no idea what my issue was even though I explained several times along with photos of my order and the items returned. He spent the entire conversation thinking that the issue was me not receiving the replacement items (the second half of my original order)."
"January 27, 2021",5,Thank you!,Elaine was very helpful and was able to help with my problem straight away without having to email anyone else or having to wait days to get further help. This was the best ASOS experience I have had when dealing with asos. She is a total credit to ASOS!

Returned 2 items over a month ago- have not received a refund, and the email back was copy and pasted. I’m pretty flawed and disgusted. Have emailed several times and not received anything back. Wouldn’t shop there ever again. Highly disappointed."

I wish anybody won't buy from you anymore and you fail"

Hermes messed up a collection and the situation is very awkward as I’m left without a receipt as the delivery person took the returns. I went in circles with reps to explain but felt I was talking to walls. Edward fast forwarded this process and understood what’s happened. Thank you for helping and I hope Hermes resolve this issue ASAP A* customer service"

"January 27, 2021",1,So incompetent,"So incompetent. Their whole system just helps all the customer service advisors avoid any responsibility in delivering a proper service. If I’ve got an issue, one advisor should help me all the way through. Instead I need to repeat myself to Mark, Ayusha, Leila, Tom and Danny. Are you even real people?? Standard copied and pasted responses that are not helpful in the slightest. Avoid ASOS at all costs. Even if you think their clothes are nice and cheap they’re not a company we should be supporting."

"January 27, 2021",1,Never got money back,"Same experience as a few Dutch people below. I ordered online, paid via IDEAL and in the end the item was out of stock. I didn't get the product and they never sent me the money back (waiting 1 month now already). I have repeatedly reached out and they keep on telling me they sent it back (without official proof just in plain text format) and I have received nothing on my bank account. Super disappointed. Last time I ordered online at ASOS."

"January 27, 2021",1,Exceptionally bad returns experience (Hermes and ASOS),"I have had to email ASOS 7 times - the 5 responses received were disappointing and showed things had not been read or understood.Hermes failed to collect my return and ASOS could not comprehend that.Several emails explained that the option to have it collected was no longer available to me (since it had been selected 2 weeks earlier, for Hermes to then not collect it)No option was given to reuse the label that had been printed on 6 Jan, this compounded the lack of an available printer.Really time consuming and disappointing. It seemed simple to begin with, but in the end I wonder if it's fraught with issues and time wasting deliberately. e.g. An email was ignored for a week, but was then responded to within 20 minutes when chased.."

"January 27, 2021",1,Unethical!,"Worst online shopping experience ever! Made a purchase where their display stated the product comes in “2-pack”. Received only one. Contacted them, asked them to either send the remaining pack or refund pro-rata. They changed their display from 2-pack to 1, and then tell me they are correct and it was me that has made a mistake/mixed-up. Not sure if this action is legal. Unethical for sure.  They even sent me trustpilot review link and tell me to leave a review if unhappy. Beware of this unethical online distributor."

"January 27, 2021",2,Miscommunication Leading to Disappointment,"I complained to ASOS as I had a product that was faulty so I spoke to the customer service team who made it sound like I could return the item to ASOS and would receive a refund for the faulty product. However, when I returned the item, with an explanation for why I was returning it, my return request was denied because the item was faulty. Even though the fault on the product was not caused by me.Therefore, I am frustrated there has been miscommunication from the ASOS customer service team as I was led to believe I would easily get a refund, whereas now I have been told I have to dispute the claim that I cannot get a refund, and there is still not a promise I will get a refund. This issue has seriously made me question if I want to shop from ASOS again as I have been let down by the service provided, and the misleading advice I was given."

"January 27, 2021",5,Very helpful!,I returned something to ASOS in December and hadn’t received a confirmation email that they received the item so I got onto ASOS chat and they were very helpful with my situation.

"January 27, 2021",1,Ridiculous returns,"I have been in contact 3 times regarding getting money back for an item I had returned 2 weeks ago along with others. It was missed and I am still waiting 2 weeks later to get my money back. Every time I get in touch with their customer service they all just do the same thing palm me off with wait 5 days on an email. I have waited 10 days at this stage and when I got in touch today they told me no refund had been requested so what had the other two people done. I am sick of it, it is wasting my time and if I hadn't checked my refund amount I would never have been paid back this money. £85 is too much money to be missed and a piece of advice would be to check every return as this could happen to you and you wouldn't notice unless you check."

"January 27, 2021",1,Dreadful customer service,"I ordered 3 dresses from ASOS on 4/01/21.  These were to be delivered by Hermes on the 6/01/21.  Hermes stated they had delivered to my address on this date. They did NOT. The photo they provided me (and then retracted) was not my home or my feet! It was not left in a safe place or a neighbours. I have spent considerable time since then chasing ASOS for a refund. I have got nowhere. I have send many emails, I have done the live chat. I have been told a refund will be issued and I will receive email confirmation and I have received none of this.  This has been ongoing for nearly a month and I HAVE NOT received my dresses. This has caused me considerable stress and upset. Edit... after at least 2 dozen emails, 3 ‘live chats’ and constant pushing, after one month I was finally issued a refund from ASOS.  My original problem was with Hermes, but ASOS made it very hard and stressful to receive a refund!"

"January 27, 2021",1,Didn't receive my parcel instead was…,Didn't receive my parcel instead was such a headache
"January 27, 2021",1,No package and no refund,"I ordered an item on December 17, 2020, and another on January 4, 2021. I was told the estimated delivery dates were Jan 14 and Jan 22 respectively. They never arrived. Upon asking, I was told that the date was pushed back to Feb 15 for the first item. Their refund policy is SUPPOSEDLY that it can be processed once the estimated delivery date has passed. I wasn't willing to wait 2 months for my item, so I asked for a refund, and they said they can't process it as there is a new estimated delivery date. For my second package, I asked 2 DAYS BEFORE if it was delayed and they said no. It didn't arrive again, so I asked them where it was, and they pushed BOTH PACKAGES back to Feb 16 now, and won't give me a refund again. They will keep pushing back your delivery date to avoid giving you a refund, and their ""policy"" is a sham. I have tried my absolute best to be patient, and while their customer service representatives are very friendly and responsive, they are held back from helping me because of these dumb policies. Also, if they have this much trouble with FedEx I don't know why they use them????"
"January 27, 2021",5,My order arrived today with an item…,"My order arrived today with an item missing, most likely due to the parcel having been damaged by DPD in transit. Spoke with Emmgie via the ASOS chat facility. Emmgie was very helpful, kind and was able to sort the issue out within 15 minutes."
"January 27, 2021",3,Helpful but sounded cross with me,"It can be difficult to get the correct tone in live help and the advisor did sound a bit abrupt, verging on the annoyed. They were helpful though and arranged a replacement order to be sent to me. It's a difficult time for everyone right now and I'm sure they must be very stressed and busy but they might need to soften their tone a bit. I felt like they were being quite angry at the end of the conversation because I was asking if my replacement could be sent out sooner. I'm shielding and finding out very hard and am relying on internet orders for everything, which I guess does make me more sensitive than I would be normally. But also, advisors should be aware that people are struggling right now."

"January 27, 2021",1,ASOS COVID-19 GREED,"Greatly disappointed by the lack of understanding and empathy given by ASOS today. As for most during the pandemic 2020 has been brutally tough. Fashion shopping was not a top priority when health and well-being was being compromised daily. Similar to most, redundancy was also looming, therefore the genuine oversight of not enjoying spending my £20 gift card during these hard times was not a priority. Today I have learnt that despite being in an awful pandemic, despite being a fashion giant, and making obscene amounts of profit from lockdown and the closure of high street retailers, they are NOT willing to honour my mere £20 birthday gift voucher, and offer an extension on the expiry date. I have seen, heard, and experienced more empathy and understanding  from local smaller retailers, and also from other fashion giants. ASOS this is pure greed, and in a world full of uncertainty and worry, such a minor of kindness would have gone a long way to what WAS a loyal customer. The fact smaller businesses who are struggling, can offer more empathy than yourselves speaks volumes. I feel that this experience needs to be voiced over the media, it isn’t your customer service representatives fault, as she kindly stated, her hands are tied, she wanted to help. Management you don’t deserve loyalty, and you don’t deserve the customer base you have, if this is the ill treatment you provide in exceptional circumstances. Greed is ugly."
"January 27, 2021",1,Disgusting service,"Disgusting service. I am disgusted. NEVERRRR order from there!!!!!!! They tell u 15 times that they will look into the situation for u!!!

I cannot believe they still fool people like this and i paid a lot for shipping, still haven’t recieved my order its been 2 months when it said it would reach in 14 days."

"January 27, 2021",2,Refund Difficulties,"Obviously Brexit has been tough on all businesses but would not recommend ordering from ASOS for awhile. They’re delivery is taking a long time which didn’t bother me, but when I attempted to get a refund they were so unhelpful. I had waited over the maximum amount of time they said it would take for a refund as I understand Brexit has really made things tough. When I did eventually email I had to twice as they did not get back to me. Then I had to message them through their Twitter page as they still had not got back to me. After a bit of back and forth they finally have said my refund has been processed but decided to add a passive aggressive comment about waiting the full 21 days before emailing next time (I had). Unless you are sure you won’t be returning wouldn’t recommend buying off ASOS until they sort themselves out."

"January 27, 2021",1,How ASOS stole my Christmas and my money.,"December 14, i made an order, i bought some Christmas  presents for my sister. I wanted them to be delivered before Christmas, so i made an express delivery and paid 30$ on top. The items were not delivered on time, so i started texting to ASOS custom care, it was already January 14th and there was no sign of my order to come. Custom care was lying me, telling that i have to pay for customs first (i wanted this parcel to be delivered to Georgia), i called to DHL after and they told me that parcel is not even in Georgia, so i could not pay for customs. After spending all my holidays texting with ASOS, i decided to as for refund, they told me that money will be refunded on my bank account after 2 weeks. 3 weeks have passed since then. now i am trying to reach ASOS custom care and they are not answering my emails. The order was worth 200$, which is half of my monthly salary in Georgia. I was waiting for my order ro be delivered in Dec 17, today is Jan 27 and i am still without my parcel and money ."

"January 27, 2021",1,Wrong order sent and I have to pay for postage again,"I ordered a suit, the sizing was good except for the pants. Even though the sizing on the website seemed perfect for me. So I returned the pants, and had to order a smaller fit because your returns policy is crap. To avoid the postage fee I thought I may as well buy a few extra garments. Now you send me another blazer instead of the pants, so I’ll have to return it again, buy another pair of pants and then pay the postage fee again. I wouldn’t even bother buying them but I have an outfit to complete. I don’t think I’ll be buying off ASOS again unless the returns policy changes. It’s a waste of my money, for a mistake I didn’t make"

I paid for next day delivery and the reason given for such an extensive delay was that they had a high sales volume. Quite frankly this is a ridiculous excuse as if you can offer a service you should be able to fill it out at least a few days within the expected delivery day, not “maybe” over a week later."

"January 27, 2021",1,ASOS returns/refund service,"I ordered an item from ASOS at the end of November which was returned within 2 weeks of receiving it. 8 weeks later and 5 emails later I still don’t have my refund. Emailing ASOS really does not work. Every response was a generic email giving frequently asked questions. Not one response related to my specific concern. The live chat wasn’t always available either however today I managed to get through on live chat and it would appear my refund will be processed. Fingers crossed. My advice would be to use ASOS live chat as emailing really made me question my online shopping experience, which ended up being totally stressful.  However hopefully after my live chat it will be completely resolved."

"January 27, 2021",5,Unable to track package,I was unable to track an order with the information from Pitney Bowes. Elaine looked into the matter for me and found that the package has been delayed.
"January 27, 2021",1,Customer service is a joke,"Customer service is dismissive and not helpful at all. I have had two orders that were both marked as shipped one week apart, both were issued a “tracking link” that is essentially useless as ASOS uses a shipping carrier that does not provide a tracking number that actually functions to track merchandise. Both “estimated delivery dates” came and went with no delivery nor any way of locating the orders. Customer service advised me to “keep an eye out” and to contact my local post office which is nonsense as there is no actual tracking number! I’ve requested a refund and was told to wait an additional week before contacting them again regarding a refund. So now I’m nearly a month past the order dates with no merchandise and no resolution of my funds. I will never order from ASOS again!"
"January 26, 2021",1,Non-existent customer service,"I placed my very first two orders ever back to back. First and last.The first order was never ever delivered. After waiting over 3 weeks, they'll only NOW deliver the item again, having me waiting another 10 days. By the time I'll get this, winter will be almost over and I'll no longer need the product.The second order was delivered on time. However, they randomly replaced an out of stock item with something else without asking me about it. Now I have to go through the hassle of printing a return label, driving to their drop off location, and waiting until they get the wrong product they sent me to get refunded for it. Not to mention the HOURS I had to spend chatting to customer service to ""resolve"" this, because they don't have any US phone number.Save yourself a headache, and purchase from the brands they carry directly."
"January 26, 2021",5,Excellent service,Marie helped me query a return that I had not yet received a refund for. Marie was extremely helpful and my query was resolved in a short amount of time.

Customer care we’re not helpful and just told me to return it for a refund and order another one if I wanted it.  All of the inconvenience was given to me without ASOS making any effort to resolve their mistake. I order form this site a lot and this is the first time I’ve had an issue and I’m very disappointed at how they handled it - turns me off ordering from them again."
"January 26, 2021",1,Do not buy do not buy,"Bought 200$ air maxes, they dropped price to 130$ the next day contacted support and they refused to refund the difference. Also just got hit with 77$ duty charge so my 200$ shoes and now basically 300$ shoes Fk this company. Never again."

I finally got involved today and Mir took the time to listen and resolve my problem within minutes!!!! Not only was he helpful but kind, patient and funny! This was my first time ordering from ASOS but because of Mir and his customer service I will for sure order from you again. Totally the employee of the month in my eyes!!!"

I was told you use a Pitney Bowes and they don’t have any tracking information! Never in my life have I experienced service this poor. I reached out via Instagram and Facebook as well as emailing and no help at all. The audacity to be told to wait yet another day. No. Begin the refund process so I can delete your app and never shop with this company again. You’ve lost a customer for life here.
"January 26, 2021",2,Unexpected custom fees,"I ordered in November and upon delivery had to pay $60. I was upset because it was unexpected. I have been an online customer for international companies for 15 years and who pays duties anymore? A deal breaker for me i decided not to order with Asos anymore. However I like the clothes so I checked back to see if policy changed. When I checked out I saw an option for duties to be included. I selected that. I was shocked to be told to pay $27.71 to get my package today.  No number to call, so I did the chat, just to be told there is nothing that can be done. Very disappointed, this ends my run with Asos. I don't pay this with any other company and don't like hassles. I don't waste my time usually on complaints but this one got to me."
"January 26, 2021",1,"Haven't received package, no tracking information","Ordered a clothing item over a month ago, still haven't received it. My tracking information hasn't been updated on Pitney Bowes either. I've contacted Asos multiple times about this and they've brushed me off. I hope they can resolve and fix this, but overall a horrible money wasting experience."

"January 26, 2021",1,Worst Shopping Experience Ever.,"I received my order several days late, and one of the items was the incorrect sizing, while another one was completely damaged and unwearable. I contacted 4 separate agents over the online chat. 3 of them ended our conversation with no explanation halfway through. I sent several emails over the course of 3 weeks to have zero progressive responses from anyone. Once I finally got in contact with someone, the best the company could do was refund me the price of one of the items and offer a refund for the other once it was returned and advised me to reorder it myself. It cost $30 to return, and $30 in delivery/pickup fees and the company refused to cover it or offer any sort of compensation for what happened. I am completely disgusted by the poor lack of customer service and the non-existent customer policy. I will not be shopping from ASOS ever again, and I will be advising future communication to people that I know to do the same. Awful experience."

"January 26, 2021",1,Absolutely Terrible Customer Service,"Absolutely terrible. Customer service has the been the worst that I have ever experienced. I ordered a package a MONTH ago, it was ""guaranteed"" to be here before Christmas, Christmas was over a month ago. I contacted you guys 8 different times via support email and you guys took 7 days to respond. I ended up doing your job for you and calling FedEx for more info. I sent and update and guess what? No response at all. I reached out again today only to hear that the items I requested and paid for are out of stock now. This is ridiculous, I've spent so much money with you guys just to be treated like I don't matter. You guys didn't even offer a discount code of expedited shipping for messing things up. I believe this will be the last order that my family and I will be placing with you. Thank you customer service team for losing our business."

"January 26, 2021",2,Horrible,"Horrible. There’s no continuation of service, so each email reply I received was from a different representative, asking me to do the exact same things I had already done. Then they began saying “if you haven’t received your parcel by xyz date, we will replace it.” That date was changed 3 times. I felt like I was slamming my head against a wall."

I only looked at the materials label after I gave them a 30 min 30° wash before I wore them and they felt different to cotton as at first and that is when I looked at the label. I would have returned them if I had not washed them. I have since heard from various people that this has happened to them with Asos. So if you're ordering a garment where the material is important to you read the label on receipt.

Which I wish to exchange however due to the item costing more now then I originally paid. I was told I would have to make up the difference out of my own pocket before this would be refunded. How appalling! There was no gift as an apology for the inconvenience and I’m in total shock a company this big would offer customer service in this way. I also asked to speak to a manager which I was Informed was not possible. In what day and age is this acceptable?

Upon starting a live chat session with someone from the team, I was assisted by someone who looked into this immediately and acted very promptly in resolving this for me and explaining very clearly what had happened. I am very impressed at how fast and hassle free this was dealt with as I was quite frustrated once I saw the payment amount had not been updated after the return had been processed. Again, very impressed and very pleased! Thank you to the person who helped me, their screen name was RonnelJohn. Excellent customer service!!"
"January 26, 2021",1,Will never deal with ASOS again,Will never deal with ASOS again.  Ordered and cancelled same day & they emailed to confirm I hadn’t been charged but in small print said “if you have it’ll take 5-10 working days to refund”.  10 working days today and nothing!!! Then they say “oh technically it was after midnight on 13th” so you should get refund by tomorrow.  Two weeks of holding onto a payment for nothing & customer service was a chat function...no human to speak to...appalling.
"January 26, 2021",1,Wrong Delivery Address Nightmare,"I recently renewed  my Premier membership through  ASOS and placed and order yesterday. I have since moved addresses since last I had ASOS premier and I thought that I had changed my address in my account,  but for some reason it had reverted to the old address and now my entire order is being shipped there. I have been online with members of the live chat for hours and even tried reaching out to DHL myself to see if they could redirect the package. But they said that only the sender could do this, which your customer service said they could not. I myself work with DHL on a daily basis and it is quite an easy feat to redirect a package. However, this has been an absolute nightmare for me and consumed my entire day. Now, your customers service team is telling me that instead of you all doing anything, I myself have to go knock on the door of my previous apartment in New York City where complete and total strangers live and hunt down my package. That is the single most  insane customer service suggestion I have heard in all my life. It is not at all safe unless I could get in contact with my previous  landlord which, so far, I have not.  So what I can only gather from this is that if I don't go to a  strangers home and check their mail bins and ring their doorbell that I will be without my money and without my package. This has been completely insane."

I waited over 3 days and got in touch again, then told ‘the investigation has been extended to5 days, please wait’ and that they can’t accept any fault until DPD say it’s their issue. No resolution offered by ASOS, no compensation, no route/timeline to me actually receiving my parcel. Shop a lot here and pay extra for express delivery service and receive no customer service in return. Now sat here waiting for a parcel that was likely damaged a while ago but no one wants to accept fault, meanwhile I’m the punished party who’s left without the order - all fun!"

"January 26, 2021",1,Extremely disappointed.,"Item was faulty within 4 months of purchase, explained this and was told to return for refund. Return was then rejected as item was worn, not at any point was it stated the item must be unworn. Consumer law states the retailer must provide evidence the item was not faulty at point of sale within first 6 months, haven't received any evidence of this. Fault is very clearly not due to wear of item, an eyelet has come loose from a lace hole. Fault has been completely ignored and not acknowledged at any point. Asked how to raise complaint as was ignored when I emailed to ask for clarification, was sent same link I originally contacted with. Adviser on chat then claimed there was no complaints dept and the only way to escalate was via Trustpilot. Didn't realise ASOS were this awful never had any issues previously."

"January 25, 2021",1,Awful experience,"Awful experience. Received a faulty pair of earrings and contacted customer services who told me a replacement would be sent out with next day delivery. The earrings never turned up and I requested for a refund. I was told that the courier sent the item back without a reason and that I won’t receive a refund until 10 days. As it wasn’t my problem that the item got returned, because I never had it, I want a refund now so I can replace the birthday present."
"January 25, 2021",1,Awful customer service.,The customer service was absolutely shocking and so unhelpful. I was sent the wrong size item. I then tried to resolve it with customer service who blamed me for receiving the wrong item and said it was down to me to rectify by repurchasing. They made no attempt to try and help me to exchange the item and rectify the mistake THEY made and now I’m doubly out of pocket after returning and waiting for a refund on the incorrect item and having to order again to try and get the right size!
"January 25, 2021",1,Issue with order bad customer service,"I recently order quite a large order from ASOS. I was notified that it had been dispatched and kept up to date with the delivery of the item. The day of delivery I was given a 2 hour time slot. During that time slot I was notified that it had been delivered to me with a picture to prove it. The picture was not clear and I did not have a parcel. I contacted the courier but was not able to get a hold of anyone as it was the weekend and was told someone would get back to me. I used my initiative and checked with many neighbours and eventually tracked the parcel down. I then opened the parcel to discover it wasn't my order. My delivery label had been stuck over the top of someone else's, there was also no paperwork inside the bag. I contacted ASOS and was talking with someone on their chat for 1 hour and 40 minutes before being told that they couldn't do anything else and that someone would contact me in 1-2 days. I did not receive anything from ASOS within that time period so contacted them again and was told that the only thing they can do for me is for me to send back the wrong items and get a full refund. So I now need to wait up to 2 weeks to get a full refund for my order which is lost somewhere.I was repeatedly told that it was due to their policies and procedures but I think they need to look at making them a little more customer friendly."

"January 25, 2021",1,Unpleasantly surprised and disappointed…,"Unpleasantly surprised and disappointed by the poor customer service from ASOS which I expected more from. Having received a faulty item, I learnt ASOS no longer issue exchanges making the process more longwinded for the customer. Returning and reordering is not always financially possible and in my instance I used a voucher so unless waiting for the refund to process I can’t reuse this on my replacement order, and if I wait the item may go out of stock - not well thought out ASOS. The item was no longer in stock anyway so I requested I kept the faulty item as it took so long to get my hands on one across many retailers and ASOS simply issue a goodwill gesture for the faulty item - this was met with a 10% discount which I could easily find on a voucher website and also requires me to spend more money with ASOS. The entire conversation made considerably more difficult by being unable to speak to someone directly. This isn’t customer service that aims to make the customer journey seamless, but to give as little as possible back to the customer and increase sales. Very disappointed, having been a long standing ASOS customer they’ve now lost my trust and custom unless resolved."

I have spoken to seven representative and  most have ended our chat while I was still trying to find a resolution. I then finally had someone from asos tell me that they would be sending me a replacement of my order to the correct address and with express shipping to get it to me as soon as possible,  only to find out a couple days later that that had never gone through, and that they will not re send , or refund the order. I am not even looking for a refund I just want the items I purchased to be delivered to my correct address. I cannot believe the lack of customer service from such a large company, I’ve been back and forth with both ASOS and Fed ex for multiple days  and both keep telling me to contact the other which is very frustrating, still with no resolution."

"January 25, 2021",1,received worn clothes with hair on !!,appalled with my latest experience with asos. delivery was good received in less than 24 hours as i had paid for the express service for a year. received and 2 of the items ( matching top and joggers ) had been worn they smelt and even had hair on and were all rubbed up. this is bad enough at the best of times but under the current climate just disgusting. went through to the useless online chat were someone hides behind a keyboard so they couldnt care less all they said was return them so i have had to mess about booking return printing out numerous sheets of paper and find parcel tape etc all at my cost. products are good if u have no issues but if u do customer service is useless and couldnt care less. i was even told i wasnt guaranteed a refund that would be assessed when they received them back ..... are u kidding me. put me off shopping again.

"January 25, 2021",1,Invest in a customer service line,"To start, I just want to say that I have been an ASOS customer since forever. However, recently there have been more and more problems with delivery and I do believe it is the delivery partner they are opting to use. I placed an order on the 17th Jan, estimated delivery was 19th Jan. Got an email from Hermes saying your parcel is delayed. That was it... I have not heard from Hermes since. I got in contact with ASOS on 20th Jan to find out where my parcel was as I had no update from Hermes. They said that there was nothing they could do and I had to wait 48 hours for Hermes to repsond. ( By the way the customer service agents are some of the worst trained agents ) They constantly ignore you , I was connected in a chat and it tooks 17 minutes for the agent to even bother to reply, and even that was an automated pre saved message they use. Anyway fast forward to Saturday, got back in touch as I had not heard anything by email as the last agent said would happen. Same response from this new agent, who said that I need to wait another 24 hours as Hermes were still yet to respond. Fine. I wait, thinking Sunday I would get an email through. Nothing. Now here we are on Monday 25th Jan, still parcelless and going into my 3rd live chat trying to find the answer to a simple question "" Where is my parcel"" , spoke to another rude and unapologetic agent who yet again replied as if time does not exist. After a few automated messages, I got my answer. My parcel was ""missing"" and not been seen since the 19th Jan. I would understand if my order was a small product, but how can big hefty boots go missing. Anyway, so this agent processes my replacement, and says it will take 4-5 days to get to me. Thats another question, why do we pay for ASOS premier delivery, if parcels are not arriving the next day? All of this bad experience could have been sorted out through a simple phone system. Sort it out ASOS!Regards,"

"January 25, 2021",1,There was a problem with delivery…,There was a problem with delivery (Hermes) and took days to sort out due to carrier problems. Then when it was agreed to resend some items were available (understandable but the refund on this can take up 10 days!) Then when items received the wrong item was received showing they don't check refund when they arrive. When talking to customer service via the chat you have to keep putting your order number in even though before the chat starts you have to say which order your talking about. The people on the chat try to help but don't seem to have any power to do anything and just copy and paste information back to you.

Every time I email them, they ask for more and more proof of return even though I have sent everything already and then they keep delaying it further and further, eventually hoping I will just give up and they can keep my money. I am owed around €250 and am extremely frustrated as I feel no one is listening to me and I am dealing with someone new every time I get a reply and am just being manipulated."

"January 25, 2021",1,"Awful customer service, unreliable shipping","I've literally never gone out of my way to write a negative review for any company but this is just so ridiculous. Purchased two beanies.. on the 8th of January with their 3-6 day shipping option, the package was claimed to have shipping out on the 12th.. so 4 days after the purchase. The estimated delivery date was the 19th of January, I reached out to them on the 23rd because I still had not received my package. They don't have a phone line so you have to go through a chat box or email, in the chat box I was met with the most non-human like experience as if I'm just talking to a bot. They repeatedly sent a copy and paste of the fact that I will need to wait until the 29th to reach back to them. As frustrating as it is that I'll have 20+ day shipping I was fine with just waiting a bit longer. The very next day at 2 in the morning I get an email that my package is delivered and of course it is not, I then again have to go and talk to the chat bot who I entail that I was met the first time with copy and paste paragraphs about the 29th. To no surprise I'm met with the same response, ""get back to us on the 29th"" and there is no compensation whatsoever for this experience which leaves an awful taste in my mouth. I like ASOS as a website and their selection but if their customer service is this bad then why should I ever bother purchasing anything from them again when I now know that there is a chance that I'll have to deal with a similar situation..?"
"January 25, 2021",1,The worst customer service experience ever,"The worst customer service experience. My order never arrived ASOS returned it to themselves. I had bought items using the 25% off student discount. This offer no longer is in place and I’ve not been offered a discount code to purchase the items again to actually receive my order, half the stuff I bought is now out of stock anyways and somehow I can’t receive my order that was originally sent ? I’ve had no help from customer service I’ve just been totally fobbed off any time I contact I’m told a different thing through the automated replies."

"January 24, 2021",1,Bad Customer Service and invalid tracking number,Bad Customer Service and invalid tracking number. I was supposed to receive a shirt that I ordered over a month ago. The tracking number provided by Asos is invalid with all carriers. The customer service rep could have cared less and told me to contact them in a month if I don't get my item. I have already waited a full month - not sure how long they are going to keep me waiting. I don't think they actually ever shipped anything to me.
"January 24, 2021",1,Bad shopping experience and terrible customer service,Customer care did not help me with my problem and didn’t actually answer my questions or concerns. Every reply was sent from a different person so I don’t feel like they knew what was going on. I lost out because of a mistake made by ASOS and they did nothing make up for it. I only used ASOS because I had received a gift voucher and this has put me off for the future.
"January 24, 2021",1,Already worn boots,"I ordered a pair of Dr Martens which came the next day.When I opened my parcel I was a bit surprised to see an unbranded box but thought nothing of it and tried the boots on.When I looked down I could see that these boots had been worn, there were scuffs all over the shoes and dirt all over them!Considering we are all being cautious due to COVID-19 I’m concerned that ASOS thought it was safe to send a pair of already worn boots.When I contacted ASOS to speak to someone all they said was that I should just return them and did not address the fact that I had put my foot in an already worn boot.Pretty careless and disappointing as I’m a regular customer and spend a lot of money on this site."
"January 24, 2021",1,Awful Customer Service Delivery,"I received a voucher from my sister for Christmas and ordered some items fromASOS on the 3rd January with next day delivery to receive on the 4th of January. I was currently isolating due to having COVID-19 and received a text that my delivery had been delivered and signed by for myself (this is not correct) and a picture sent of my delivery which was in my block but on the first floor and next to the lift. I had not said that this was a safe place and I live on the fifth floor, there is even a poster up asking delivery drivers not to leave parcels there as we have a theft issue.  My neighbour went to check if the one parcel was still there. When she went to see it was no surprise to see that it was wrong. I understand ASOS use other partner companies to deliver their items. However, I have phoned on 8 occasions and have emailed four times to try and get this issue resolved. It is twenty days since I should have received my order.  I was also told a customer service agent that they would call me back and this never happened. In one instance, the customer service agent actually gave me DPDs number and suggested I chase this up myself. One another call a customer service agent cut me off when I was explaining what had happened. This is all stress that I could have been doing without when I was suffering and recovering from Covid 19. Thanks to Alena, who I spoke with today who actually managed to resolve the issue. However this is not acceptable after twenty days and having to chase up ASOS on so many occasions."

All I want is a refund for my order and I pay for vip and never actually get next day delivery this has been 4 days and 3 delayed emails later and still nothing and Rowen had nothing to say other than he can’t give me a refund which is absolutely ridiculous, I am paying for a service and goods that aren’t being delivered and nothing to compensate for this and to think I recommend you to people this will no longer be happening absolutely livid"
"January 24, 2021",1,DISGUSTING CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Where do I start? I am a great customer to ASOS and shop here every month spending at least over £100. I’ve only ever had one issue before where something was delayed and I could ring someone. They let me know what was happening and offered me a discount code as a gesture of goodwill. Cut to this time. My order was meant to be delivered on 21st January. I got in touch on 22nd being advised I needed to allow 48 hours which I have. In this conversation with Genesis, I was denied a gesture of goodwill so I could reorder, I was denied talking to a manager and I was rudely spoken to. After telling him that it wouldnt be the last he heard from me, how upset I was at his service and that I would be speaking to his manager, he responded ‘no worries.’ This is absolutely DISGUSTING customer service. How dare someone who works and represents your company be so cheeky to me! I have screenshots of all of this. I then got in touch again today after the 48 hours where I was promised an email update from Genesis. I have not received the email and got in touch with Lynnie. Our first chat was short lived as she only managed to respond to me twice with copy and pasted ‘don’t worry I’ll get this sorted’ messages and then I was left alone for over 20 minutes. After feeling ridiculously abandoned and not supported as a customer, I terminated that chat and started a new one, only to be put with Lynnie again who has again not responded to me for now over 30 minutes. Not even a message to let me know she was there. After she finally got in touch, she said she would resend my order only to turn around and act like she never could from the beginning. I then had to get in touch with someone else as Lynnie said they transferred me to a manager which was another big lie as I waited for another 20 minutes on the live chat. I then got through to Arianne who obviously could not be bothered with me and instead of answering a very simple question for me, terminated the chat so she didn’t have to deal with me anymore. I feel extremely frustrated, absolutely livid and taken for granted as a customer to ASOS. If this is the customer service you are dishing out, it is something that needs serious work. I still have no idea where my parcel is, no one is helping me, I have been lied to, spoken to disgustingly and ignored."
"January 24, 2021",1,great  customer service agents horrible policies,"First i will say Nikko was great. it has noting to do with her/him. this is not the first time i have an issue with a delivery and you cant help, it is customary if you remove one of the items from my order to let me cancel. i order from you regularly and i'm seriously considering to stop, and to start placing order with shein. im a regular customer i only complain when absolutely  necessary and yet 90 % of the time when i asked for assistance you refused to help."

"January 24, 2021",1,Useless,"Terrible service and extremely unhelpful. It has been a month since my package shipped and the best information ASOS can provide is [we don't know, we don't have any info, you just have to wait]. It is your responsibility to communicate with your carrier and manage tracking information so it's available to customers. Pitney Bowes is useless as well, the tracking number provided doesn't exist in their system and the contact I was given didn't help either. ASOS shouldn't use them as a carrier anymore."

"January 24, 2021",1,Useless,"Terrible. Extremely unhelpful and futile. I love buying from asos but on the few occasions where I've had to contact customer services for issues such as my parcel not being delivered, refund not being issued, or my current issue of trying to get a refund for a faulty necklace I returned, the service is extremely painful and unhelpful. They make no effort to try to look into or resolve your issue. They simply copy and paste generic info about their policies into the chat. My issue today has still not been resolved and the person I spoke to offered no help whatsoever. The only thing I can do is keep ringing and emailing them and explaining the whole thing from the beginning again as updating customer accounts with queries and relevant information is too much hard work for them. Why don't other companies who make much less money have this problem? Why is the onus on the customers, some of whom spend hundreds or thousands on asos stock, to chase up and literally try to force the company to bloody fulfil their basic duties towards the customer? Not impressed at all and will give asos a hard swerve from now on, dealing with them is like talking to a brick wall and is just not worth the aggro."

I opened the item and the shoes looked worn, there was dirt around the shoe, including the sole, plus pen marks. I spoke to an advisor called Dean and he said I cannot exchange my shoes as it’s within the policy.I asked if there were any other recommendations and he mentioned that I can get a refund and re order them. I said I don’t want a refund because I purchased the shoes yesterday and yesterday was the last day that I could’ve applied 25% discount on the shoes plus I used a £10 voucher from my workplace that I earned to purchase the shoes. Dean said okay, return the shoes and he’ll speak to customer relations to ensure I would get my 25% plus £10 voucher. I keep on emphasizing that it’s very unfair and unacceptable then he eventually told me everything is handled, all I need to do is return the items then once the return has processed then they will give me 25% plus £10 voucher. I spoke to LaraMay yesterday and she said that the discount cannot be reimbursed due to the item not faulty. I said I have an recorded conversation of Dean telling me I would receive my discount and voucher, I sent her proof then she left the chat. A woman name Beth came in the chat, I asked Beth why has LaraMay has been replaced, she then left the chat. Another woman named Hannah came in the chat, I asked her the same question and she left the chat. Beth came back again and then left the chat while I am asking for support.

The previous two orders canceled by customer support due to a 'tech issue' without giving a proper explanation, now 100 EUR worth of order hasn't been shipped out for two weeks and customer support is not replying to my messages. What the heck!?You are giving off really scammy vibes, ASOS!"

The annual next-day delivery service is amazing and a very clever marketing tactic as I definitely purchase more often from ASOS now I have this.

"January 23, 2021",1,ASOS do not care about customer service,"ASOS's courier (Hermes) failed to deliver my order. Whilst that is not the direct fault of ASOS, their subsequent inability to find my order, make a replacement order or refund me defies belief. The only efficient way to communicate with them is their online chat windows, where the operators are clearly constrained by time, procedures and capability issues. I have been repeatedly told my issue was resolved.....but also that if that resolution wasn't successful, to get back to ASOS again. And this has forced me to have to revert to them multiple times, wasting at least 3 hours in total on cat windows, and still without resolution 17 days after order placement and 6 days after starting to complain to ASOS, They also refuse to give out a means of communicating with a customer service manager (I repeatedly asked for an email I could write to them at). Incredibly frustrating and I wasn't just unlucky with 1 bad chat operator. They are all clearly constrained by a process which is inefficient, doesn't allow a human to take responsibility for a customer problem, and wont provide a means of escalation to management. Once this issue is resolved I will clearly take my business elsewhere. I guess profits are more important than customer satisfaction."

"January 23, 2021",1,Ordered shoe size 6US and received 6UK,"Ordered shoe size 6US and received 6UK! larger with 2 sizes. I don't live in the USA so I'm not able to return the item and if I do it will cost more than I paid for buying it (they promised that if I save the receipt of sending an item back, it will be refunded but of course I can't trust in this). With their ""Policies"" refunding cant be done unless they don't get the item back. So, as I wanted it so bad ordered a new one with a smaller size and ask the ASOS team for checking if the correct size was shipped. Of course, nobody could help in this too :) THAT IS NOT A SERVICE IF YOU CALL IT!!!! and a company like this should be more loyal to its customers/buyers."

"January 23, 2021",1,Two orders claimed delivered by ASOS and DPD that haven’t been and I am out of pocket,Two orders claimed delivered by ASOS and DPD. Picture of my closed front door of a block of flats in a very busy place in London is enough. DPD agreed this is not a safe place and that ASOS should contact. I am a key worker working 12 hour shifts. This was signed by DPD claiming by me. I am down £100 with DPD and ASOS saying they can do nothing. I have sent multiple emails with no one getting back to me. On Facebook days to come back. Live chat only thing that works and I get different stories. I have used ASOS for 10 years and I feel undervalued and disrespected as a customer. Considering I have spent probably over ten thousand pounds in my history and have not complained. I am extremely disappointed. I will be terminating my relationship with ASOS.

"January 23, 2021",1,Awful and misleading customer care,"Ordered an item on Sunday for next day delivery. Item hadn’t arrived by Tuesday. Contact customer care and they said that they needed 48 hours to investigate and they would be back in touch with me. After 48 hours no one had gotten in touch with me. I then spoke to someone else who informed me the item for whatever reason had been returned to the factory. Fine. She asked if I wanted a refund or the item sent out again. I said I wanted the item sent out again with next day delivery as that is what I paid for. She said that’s fine and I should receive a new order confirmation within 24 hours. 24hours passed. No order confirmation. I contact ASOS again. Who told me that I was misinformed and couldn’t have the item resent out to me and that I had to have a refund. And I needed to wait 7 days for the item to be returned to the factory and a further 10 days for the refund. Awful customer service. No one ever got back in touch with me, it was up to me to contact ASOS every time a timescale had passed. And I know have to wait 2 weeks for a refund for an item I paid next day delivery for that I never received. Can honestly say the amount of hassle this was I won’t be ordering from them again."

Never rec'd a confirmation email from them upon receipt.  I need to return it due to poor quality.  I called them & chatted with them numerous times, requesting for a return label.  Apparently, they can't send me one since I can't provide my email address.  Providing them my name, mailing address & credit card # was not worth anything.  Apparently, ONLY my email address would work.  Yup.. go figure!  Makes no sense. So now I’m stuck with a coat because of unknown email address"

I spent hours on the phone and live chat with both. In the end, they did nothing to help me.

There was a problem with my address so the carrier couldn't reach me.. though i had write my address exactly the same as my first order. I didn't got any information about it, no emails no sms.. the ASOS customer service told me that and did their best to help me.. somehow today i got a call from the collection point to tell me they have my order with no name on it (""null"" was written) my phone number and address too. I get there and got it Hopefully no one take it. Coz sometimes that happens I hope my next experience be as good as my first one, and no other ""null"" experiences get through. 😅Thanks for your care and support.I'm sure you will not disappoint Best regards Hanan Safadi"
"January 22, 2021",1,the app sends false promotion alerts to attract/trap customers,"upon suggestion of asos' customer care i'm reporting this issue here. the app would send push notifications for promo codes. when trying to apply it says that the promo code would not be eligible for my delivery country. even if changing the delivery country the promo codes would not work. this kind of 'marketing' seems to be a trap to attract customers and mislead customers with false alerts. according to customer care asos would also send out promo codes via email, if you live in an eligible country where they have a promotion ongoing. having verified the emails, no promo code was sent during the entire 2020. this issue (regarding false promo code notifications received via app) was addressed on different occasions in the past year to customer care. no actions so far. seems like a strategy."

I ordered a lingerie body that arrived with no labels whatsoever and no plastic sticker lining. To me this is then considered a return, pre worn item. If I am purchasing undergarments I expect them to be brand new and it is completely unacceptable and unsanitary to receive otherwise. This is the case in all circumstances but even more so given current ones. I have been advised to return the item within 28 days and re-order to remedy the situation here. I am an individual living alone with a compromised immune system and through no fault of my own have received an item that can be considered unsanitary and on top of that I have to risk my health in order to return the item.

It is now 22nd January 2021 and I have still not received my refund. Sent Asos an email 2 weeks ago and never got a reply. Have spoke to 3 ASOS customer service agents via chat and only 1 named Michael tried to help me. A customer service agent named Christina was appalling, just told me to contact Parcel Connect and ended the chat without even allowing me to reply to her. Another day I was on chat for over 1 hour and had to send photos of my proof of return and I was made jump through hoops only to be told they could not process my return and advised me to contact them again in 2 days time. ASOS customer service agents on chat are not helpful at all - Christina was even rude. Waiting 2 weeks and no reply to my email and still no refund. I was told by one customer service agent that my refund would be processed but then Christina appeared on the same chat and told me to contact parcel connect and then ended the chat so I could not reply to her. Absolutely appalling and confusing customer service. ASOS do better, your customers do not deserve to be treated like this. My advice is avoid ASOS at all costs!"

As in DHL system it appeared that my parcel has not been passed to them and has not left warehouse. I did contact ASOS customer care, asked to resolve my issue regards delivery and if possible to request a refund. And the next morning I received very detailed email about that updates has been checked for me and refund request has been requested! I am very happy that reply was detailed and so quick. It was excellent. Now waiting for my refund"
"January 22, 2021",5,After a very negative customer service…,"After a very negative customer service experience earlier in the week. I can wholeheartedly say that my customer service experience today was brilliant. “Gemini” was very helpful, clearly knew what they were doing and reassured me of all the steps they were taking at every stage."
"January 22, 2021",5,Amazing customer service every time,Amazing customer service every time! Cannot fault ASOS in the slightest they are head and shoulders above a lot of other clothing companies on their service.
"January 22, 2021",1,Very unhelpful,"Very unhelpful, while speaking with one member of the customer service team he simply dismissed me by sending me a link to complete this survey, without ever rectifying my issue. I replied and seemed to be re-directed to another representative who simply stated their name and has not written anything else since, despite my sending a question and multiple 'hello?' messages to prompt a reply. Horrendous customer service."
"January 22, 2021",1,Will never use ASOS again,"I ordered a jacket in 1/1 for my son whose birthday was 21/1. Money was taken from account and email received to say we would have the package by the 20/1. As if this morning still no package, no details on DHL for shipping and 3 online chats to ASOS to be eventually told your package must be lost. Very bad service. I’ve been offered a refund and why shouldn’t I. It’s my money. But now I’ve to go online (definitely not to ASOS ever again) and look for another present which will probably take a few days to get here. Totally unacceptable ASOS."
"January 22, 2021",1,Appalled with the customer service I…,Appalled with the customer service I have received. I have been led to believe my matter was being resolved each time I spoke with the ASOS team and this wasn’t the case. This was a birthday gift which is now over a week late.
"January 22, 2021",1,Absolutely awful customer service,Absolutely awful customer service. I've been trying to get a refunded voucher to show on my account and it's been over 2 weeks and no success.

The package came delivered with no bubble wrap protecting any of the products, as a result, the expensive eyeshadow palette came smashed. I contacted customer service for support and the agent gave me two unacceptable options.I am Asthmatic with a little child with no means of transportation and strict advise from my doctor to stay indoors due to Covid. I also do not have access to a printer, all of which I explained to the agent. Instead of listening and finding appropriate solutions to offer, the agent tells me to go on a hunt for someone to print my label (in the heat of Covid and I haven't seen my family in months) or I go to the post office. At this moment in time, my issue is not resolved and Asos have refused to refund my money. Don't buy anything from them, the customer service is trash."

"January 22, 2021",1,I ordered some stuff from Asos back in…,"I ordered some stuff from Asos back in December, only half the order arrived. I contacted them and they said they would arrange a replacement order. I contacted a source earlier this month regarding this issue. I received an email on the 8th of January saying they were processing your replacement, but have had no communication since. Two weeks later contacted asos to find out what's going on, only to be told that all the items I wanted were out of stock and they refund me via Pay Pal on the 11th. All this happened without even letting me know, how hard is it to send and email. That's poor customer service"
"January 22, 2021",5,All my questions was answer it with all information that i need.,I try to change my delivery address.
"January 22, 2021",1,I was sent the wrong product and you refuse to take responsibility for your error,"I was sent the wrong product. Your customer service was response to put the responsibility on me for making this right, instead of taking any responsibility or action. At the moment, I'm out $40 and have a product that I don't want and didn't pay for. You are now asking me to put my health at risk to put this back to you during a pandemic. Instead, you should ship me the right order right away, since I sent you proof of your mistake, or refund my money and send me a return label and shipping materials. This is absurd and disrespectful."

"January 21, 2021",1,Customer Services - incredibly unhelpful,One of my Marley earphones has stopped working within warranty. The warranty says to return them to the supplier (place of purchase). this is ASOS. I tried a 'chat' and was told to return them. I was sent an email with instructions to print the returns label. No return label was attached. I tried another chat and was then told that i had to return them to House of Marley. Even when i quoted the warranty this person would not accept that they needed to be returned to ASOS. I asked for an email for the complaints department and was given a link to this. Not convinced that management will respond to this. very shoddy service indeed.

"January 21, 2021",3,Asos shopping experience,"I've ordered about three times and I think it's safe to say that I won't be buying any more clothes there unless I've seen them in reality and will buy them on Asos instead. I returned one order out of three because it wasn't the same product as seen on photos. The other two were simply bad because there was poor quality or small sizing, but I somehow managed to wear it once or twice and then sold it second-hand at a lower price. Shipping on the other hand was just fine and there were no issues with the return."

"January 21, 2021",1,TRICKED ME OUT OF MY MONEY. F ASOS's poo quality basic crap and the worst customer policies I've EVER SEEN.,"COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A WORSE EXPERIENCE. I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH APPALLING TREATMENT. YOU ARE thieves!!!!!!! The Canadian site REALLY needs to specify we will be charged duties for packages under $140. The Canadian site REALLY needs to specific that no, returns are not free (EVEN THOUGH the site says they are). IF the Canadian site actually gave the info we customers need, I WOULD NOT HAVE ORDERED. I paid an extra $20 to receive my package, and now ASOS wants to charge me another $20 TO RETURN the low quality crap item this is. EFFING BS!!! NEVER ORDERING FROM ASOS AGAIN."

"January 21, 2021",1,This review is solely based on customer…,"This review is solely based on customer service or lack of. I paid £9.99 for premium delivery (items ordered before the cut off time are delivered next day). ASOS have a real issue in communication with regards to the order. I don’t receive my items next day - so what’s the point of having paid for it? I contact ASOS chat and they always say “we know it’s frustrating”. I’ve paid for a service I don’t receive. I don’t recommend you waste your money. I don’t get an update from the courier, I wait for a package that I end up getting 2-3 days later. It’s so annoying - especially the rude staff that then stop replying on the online chat."

When I contacted asos after fedex said only the SHIPPER could make changes, asos rep refused and said nothing they could and suggest I instead go to a building where I haven't lived in FOUR years and try to get in and get the package DURING A PANDEMIC! Unbelievable. Telling all my friends to avoid this website!"

I received a response from someone called Luke, he asked if I wanted the items refunded or replaced. I said replaced. Since I have emailed about 5 times, no one is responding to say what is happening. I don't know if has been ordered or when it will be delivered. Very disappointing as really loved shopping at ASOS."
"January 21, 2021",1,If I could put zero stars I would!,If I could put zero stars I would! I have had an awful experience with Asos. First I ordered a grey jumper around Christmas time and it was delivered with a hole in the sleeve and someone had tried to sew it back up with red thread!? I dont understand why Asos thought this was suitable to send. Then recently I ordered another jumper in a medium and but was delivered as a large I doubled checked and I defiantly ordered a medium. I returned and ordered another and again they sent me a large! This jumper was also for a 21st which has now come and gone and all I've got so far is a sorry. Again appalled by this service!

"January 21, 2021",1,"Awful customer service, really disappointed",Awful customer service. Received a parcel for another customer and not my own order 20 days ago. Still no refund or the discount code I originally used so I can reorder the items I wanted at the price I paid. Have followed this up many many times but responses have been inconsistent and false promises given. Not able to get a phone number to speak to someone and chat and email support has been slow and lacking in understanding of the problem. Feel very voiceless and unheard.
